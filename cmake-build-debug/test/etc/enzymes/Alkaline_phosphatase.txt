   Alkaline phosphatase (ALP, ALKP, ALPase, Alk Phos) (EC 3.1.3.1), or
   basic phosphatase, is a homodimeric protein enzyme of 86
   kilodaltons. Each monomer contains five cysteine residues, two zinc
   atoms and one magnesium atom crucial to its catalytic function, and it
   is optimally active at alkaline pH environments.
   ALP has the physiological role of dephosphorylating compounds. The
   enzyme is found across a multitude of organisms, prokaryotes and
   eukaryotes alike, with the same general function but in different
   structural forms suitable to the environment they function in. Alkaline
   phosphatase is found in the periplasmic space of E. coli bacteria. This
   enzyme is heat stable and has its maximum activity at high pH. In
   humans, it is found in many forms depending on its origin within the
   body - it plays an integral role in metabolism within the liver and
   development within the skeleton. Due to its widespread prevalence in
   these areas, its concentration in the bloodstream is used by
   diagnosticians as a biomarker in helping determine diagnoses such as
   hepatitis or osteomalacia.
   The level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood is checked through the
   ALP test, which is often part of routine blood tests. The levels of
   this enzyme in the blood depend on factors such as age, sex, or blood
   type. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase also increase by two to
   four times during pregnancy. This is a result of additional alkaline
   phosphatase produced by the placenta. Additionally, abnormal levels
   of alkaline phosphatase in the blood could indicate issues relating to
   the liver, gall bladder or bones. Kidney tumors and infections as well
   as malnutrition have also shown abnormal level of alkaline phosphatase
   in blood. Alkaline phosphatase levels in a cell can be measured
   through a process called "The scoring method". A blood smear is usually
   taken and stained to categorize each leukocyte into specific "leukocyte
   alkaline phosphatase indices". This marker is designed to distinguish
   leukocytes and determine different enzyme activity from each sample's
   extent of staining.
