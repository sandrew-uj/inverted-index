   Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) encoded by the gene PC is an enzyme of the
   ligase class that catalyzes (depending on the species) the
   physiologically irreversible^[citation needed] carboxylation of
   pyruvate to form oxaloacetate (OAA).
     * Pyruvic acid
     * Oxaloacetic acid
   The reaction it catalyzes is:
          pyruvate + HCO^-
          [3] + ATP -> oxaloacetate + ADP + P
   It is an important anaplerotic reaction that creates oxaloacetate from
   pyruvate. The enzyme is a mitochondrial protein containing a biotin
   prosthetic group, requiring magnesium or manganese and acetyl-CoA.
   Pyruvate carboxylase was first discovered in 1959 at Case Western
   Reserve University by M. F. Utter and D. B. Keech. Since then
   it has been found in a wide variety of prokaryotes and eukaryotes
   including fungi, bacteria, plants, and animals. In mammals, PC
   plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis, in the
   biosynthesis of neurotransmitters, and in glucose-induced insulin
   secretion by pancreatic islets. Oxaloacetate produced by PC is an
   important intermediate, which is used in these biosynthetic
   pathways. In mammals, PC is expressed in a tissue-specific manner,
   with its activity found to be highest in the liver and kidney
   (gluconeogenic tissues), in adipose tissue and lactating mammary gland
   (lipogenic tissues), and in pancreatic islets. Activity is moderate in
   brain, heart and adrenal gland, and least in white blood cells and skin
   fibroblasts.
