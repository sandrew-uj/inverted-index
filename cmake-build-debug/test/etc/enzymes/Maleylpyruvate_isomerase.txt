   In enzymology, a maleylpyruvate isomerase (EC 5.2.1.4) is an enzyme
   that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          3-maleylpyruvate
           3-fumarylpyruvate
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-maleylpyruvate, and one
   product, 3-fumarylpyruvate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans
   isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   3-maleylpyruvate cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme participates in
   tyrosine metabolism.
