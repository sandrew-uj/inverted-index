   PDBsum structure summary
   The carbonic anhydrases (or carbonate dehydratases) form a family of
   enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between carbon dioxide and
   water and the dissociated ions of carbonic acid (i.e. bicarbonate and
   hydrogen ions). The active site of most carbonic anhydrases
   contains a zinc ion. They are therefore classified as metalloenzymes.
   The enzyme maintains acid-base balance and helps transport carbon
   dioxide.
   Carbonic anhydrase helps maintain acid-base homeostasis, regulate pH,
   and fluid balance. Depending on its location, the role of the enzyme
   changes slightly. For example, carbonic anhydrase produces acid in the
   stomach lining. In the kidney, the control of bicarbonate ions
   influences the water content of the cell. The control of bicarbonate
   ions also influences the water content in the eyes. Inhibitors of
   carbonic anhydrase are used to treat glaucoma, the excessive build up
   of water in the eyes. Blocking this enzyme shifts the fluid balance in
   the eyes of the patient to reduce fluid build up thereby relieving
   pressure.
   The Bohr Effect is a way to describe hemoglobin's oxygen binding
   affinity. The Bohr Effect was described by Christian Bohr in the year
   1904, and it refers to a shift in an oxygen dissociation curve that is
   caused by a change in concentration of carbon dioxide or a change in
   the pH. Essentially an increase in carbon dioxide results in lowered
   blood pH which lowers oxygen-hemoglobin binding. The opposite is
   true where a decrease in the concentration of carbon dioxide raises the
   blood pH which raises the rate of oxygen-hemoglobin binding. Relating
   the Bohr Effect to carbonic anhydrase is simple: carbonic anhydrase
   speeds up the reaction of carbon dioxide reacting with water to produce
   hydrogen ions (protons) and bicarbonate ions.
   To describe equilibrium in the carbonic anhydrase reaction, Le
   Chatelier's principle is used. The tissues are more acidic than the
   lungs because carbon dioxide is produced by cellular respiration and it
   reacts with water in the tissues to produce the hydrogen protons.
   Because the carbon dioxide concentration is higher, equilibrium shifts
   to the right, to the bicarbonate side. The opposite is seen in the
   lungs where carbon dioxide is being released so its concentration is
   lower so equilibrium shifts to the left towards carbon dioxide to try
   and raise its concentration.
   This image shows the cyclic mechanism for carbonic anhydrase.
