   Ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.4.2, ribonucleotide
   reductase, 2'-deoxyribonucleoside-triphosphate:oxidized-thioredoxin
   2'-oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with systematic name
   2'-deoxyribonucleoside-triphosphate:thioredoxin-disulfide
   2'-oxidoreductase. This enzyme catalyses the following
   chemical reaction
          2'-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate + thioredoxin disulfide +
          H[2]O
           ribonucleoside triphosphate + thioredoxin
   Ribonucleoside-triphosphate reductase requires a cobamide coenzyme and
   ATP.
