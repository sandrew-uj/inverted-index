   In enzymology, an ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.13) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:
   The partial cyclization of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to ent-copalyl
   pyrophosphate is catalyzed by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase.
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and
   one product, ent-copalyl pyrophosphate. This enzyme participates in
   gibberellin biosynthesis.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class
   of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   ent-copalyl-diphosphate lyase (decyclizing). Other names in common use
   include ent-kaurene synthase A, and ent-kaurene synthetase A.
