   DnaB helicase is an enzyme in bacteria which opens the replication fork
   during DNA replication. Although the mechanism by which DnaB both
   couples ATP hydrolysis to translocation along DNA and denatures the
   duplex is unknown, a change in the quaternary structure of the protein
   involving dimerisation of the N-terminal domain has been observed and
   may occur during the enzymatic cycle. Initially when DnaB binds to
   dnaA, it is associated with dnaC, a negative regulator. After DnaC
   dissociates, DnaB binds dnaG.
   The N-terminal has a multi-helical structure that forms an orthogonal
   bundle. The C-terminal domain contains an ATP-binding site and is
   therefore probably the site of ATP hydrolysis.
   In eukaryotes, helicase function is provided by the MCM (Minichromosome
   maintenance) complex.
   The DnaB helicase is the product of the dnaB gene. The helicase enzyme
   that is produced is a hexamer in E. coli, as well as in many other
   bacteria. The energy for DnaB activity is provided by NTP hydrolysis.
   Mechanical energy moves the DnaB into the replication fork, physically
   splitting it in half.
