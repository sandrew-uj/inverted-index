   Terpentedienyl-diphosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.15, terpentedienol
   diphosphate synthase, Cyc1, clerodadienyl diphosphate synthase) is an
   enzyme with systematic name terpentedienyl-diphosphate lyase
   (decyclizing). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical
   reaction
          geranylgeranyl diphosphate
           terpentedienyl diphosphate
   This enzyme requires Mg^2+.
