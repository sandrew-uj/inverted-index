   Firefly luciferase is the light-emitting enzyme responsible for the
   bioluminescence of fireflies and click beetles. The enzyme catalyses
   the oxidation of firefly luciferin, requiring oxygen and ATP. Because
   of the requirement of ATP, firefly luciferases have been used
   extensively in biotechnology.
