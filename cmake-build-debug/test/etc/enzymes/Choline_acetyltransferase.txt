   Choline acetyltransferase (commonly abbreviated as ChAT, but sometimes
   CAT) is a transferase enzyme responsible for the synthesis of the
   neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ChAT catalyzes the transfer of an
   acetyl group from the coenzyme acetyl-CoA to choline, yielding
   acetylcholine (ACh). ChAT is found in high concentration in cholinergic
   neurons, both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral
   nervous system (PNS). As with most nerve terminal proteins, ChAT is
   produced in the body of the neuron and is transported to the nerve
   terminal, where its concentration is highest. Presence of ChAT in a
   nerve cell classifies this cell as a "cholinergic" neuron. In humans,
   the choline acetyltransferase enzyme is encoded by the CHAT gene.
