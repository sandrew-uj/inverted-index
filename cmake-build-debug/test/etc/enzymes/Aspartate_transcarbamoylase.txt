   Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (also known as aspartate
   transcarbamoylase or ATCase) catalyzes the first step in the pyrimidine
   biosynthetic pathway (EC 2.1.3.2).
   In E. coli, the enzyme is a multi-subunit protein complex composed of
   12 subunits (300 kDa in total). The composition of the subunits is
   C[6]R[6], forming 2 trimers of catalytic subunits (34 kDa) and 3 dimers
   of regulatory subunits (17 kDa). The particular arrangement of
   catalytic and regulatory subunits in this enzyme affords the complex
   with strongly allosteric behaviour with respect to its substrates.
   The enzyme is an archetypal example of allosteric modulation of fine
   control of metabolic enzyme reactions.
   ATCase does not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Instead, it lies
   between its low-activity, low-affinity "tense" and its high-activity,
   high-affinity "relaxed" states. The binding of substrate to the
   catalytic subunits results in an equilibrium shift towards the R state,
   whereas binding of CTP to the regulatory subunits results in an
   equilibrium shift towards the T state. Binding of ATP to the regulatory
   subunits results in an equilibrium shift towards the R state.
