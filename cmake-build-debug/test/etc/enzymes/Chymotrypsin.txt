   Chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1, chymotrypsins A and B, alpha-chymar ophth,
   avazyme, chymar, chymotest, enzeon, quimar, quimotrase, alpha-chymar,
   alpha-chymotrypsin A, alpha-chymotrypsin) is a digestive enzyme
   component of pancreatic juice acting in the duodenum, where it performs
   proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides.
   Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side
   chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P[1]
   position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and
   phenylalanine). These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their
   side chain that fits into a hydrophobic pocket (the S[1] position) of
   the enzyme. It is activated in the presence of trypsin. The hydrophobic
   and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P[1] side chain
   and the enzyme S[1] binding cavity accounts for the substrate
   specificity of this enzyme. Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other
   amide bonds in peptides at slower rates, particularly those containing
   leucine and methionine at the P[1] position.
   Structurally, it is the archetypal structure for its superfamily, the
   PA clan of proteases.
