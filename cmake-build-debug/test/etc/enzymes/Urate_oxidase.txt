   The enzyme urate oxidase (UO), uricase or factor-independent urate
   hydroxylase, absent in humans, catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to
   5-hydroxyisourate:
          Uric acid + O[2] + H[2]O -> 5-hydroxyisourate + H[2]O[2]
          5-hydroxyisourate + H[2]O[2] -> allantoin + CO[2]
   Uric acid
   5-hydroxyisourate
   Allantoin
