   Molybdenum cofactor sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.9, molybdenum cofactor
   sulfurase, ABA3, MoCo sulfurase, MoCo sulfurtransferase) is an enzyme
   with systematic name L-cysteine:molybdenum cofactor
   sulfurtransferase. This enzyme catalyses the following
   chemical reaction
          molybdenum cofactor + L-cysteine + 2 H^+
           thio-molybdenum cofactor + L-alanine + H[2]O
   This enzyme contains pyridoxal phosphate.
