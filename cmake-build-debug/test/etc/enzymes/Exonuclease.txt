   Exonucleases are enzymes that work by cleaving nucleotides one at a
   time from the end (exo) of a polynucleotide chain. A hydrolyzing
   reaction that breaks phosphodiester bonds at either the 3' or the 5'
   end occurs. Its close relative is the endonuclease, which cleaves
   phosphodiester bonds in the middle (endo) of a polynucleotide chain.
   Eukaryotes and prokaryotes have three types of exonucleases involved in
   the normal turnover of mRNA: 5' to 3' exonuclease (Xrn1), which is a
   dependent decapping protein; 3' to 5' exonuclease, an independent
   protein; and poly(A)-specific 3' to 5' exonuclease.
   In both archaea and eukaryotes, one of the main routes of RNA
   degradation is performed by the multi-protein exosome complex, which
   consists largely of 3' to 5' exoribonucleases.
