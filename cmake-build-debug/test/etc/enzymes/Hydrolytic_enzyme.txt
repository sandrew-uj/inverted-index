   Hydrolase is a class of enzyme that commonly perform as biochemical
   catalysts that use water to break a chemical bond, which typically
   results in dividing a larger molecule into smaller molecules. Some
   common examples of hydrolase enzymes are esterases including lipases,
   phosphatases, glycosidases, peptidases, and nucleosidases.
   Esterases cleave ester bonds in lipids and phosphatases cleave
   phosphate groups off molecules. An example of crucial esterase is
   acetylcholine esterase, which assists in transforming the neuron
   impulse into acetic acid after it the hydrolase breaks the
   acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. Acetic acid is an
   important metabolite in the body and a critical intermediate for other
   reactions such as glycolysis. Lipases hydrolyze glycerides.
   Glycosidases cleave sugar molecules off carbohydrates and peptidases
   hydrolyze peptide bonds. Nucleosidases hydrolyze the bonds of
   nucleotides.
   Hydrolase enzymes are important for the body because they have
   degradative properties. In lipids, lipases contribute to the breakdown
   of fats and lipoproteins and other larger molecules into smaller
   molecules like fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids and other small
   molecules are used for synthesis and as a source of energy.
   In biochemistry, a hydrolase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis
   of a chemical bond. For example, any enzyme that catalyzes the
   following reaction is a hydrolase:
          A-B + H[2]O -> A-OH + B-H
   where A- B represents a chemical bond of unspecified molecules.
