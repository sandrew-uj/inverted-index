   In enzymology, an adenosylmethionine hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.2) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          S-adenosyl-L-methionine + H[2]O
           L-homoserine + methylthioadenosine
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl-L-methionine and
   H[2]O, whereas its two products are L-homoserine and
   methylthioadenosine.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on ether bonds involving sulfur (thioether and trialkylsulfonium
   hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   S-adenosyl-L-methionine hydrolase. Other names in common use include
   S-adenosylmethionine cleaving enzyme, methylmethionine-sulfonium-salt
   hydrolase, and adenosylmethionine lyase.
