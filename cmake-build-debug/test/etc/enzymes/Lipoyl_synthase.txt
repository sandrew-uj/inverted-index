   Lipoyl synthase is an enzyme that belongs to the radical SAM
   (S-adenosylmethionine) family. Within the radical SAM superfamily,
   lipoyl synthase is in a sub-family of enzymes that catalyze sulfur
   insertion reactions. Enzymes in this family contain two 4Fe-4S
   clusters, from which they obtain the sulfur groups that will be
   transferred onto the corresponding substrates. This particular
   enzyme participates in lipoic acid metabolism, so it transfers two
   sulfurs from its 4Fe-4S cluster onto the protein N[6]-(octanoyl)lysine
   through radical generation. This enzyme is usually localized to the
   mitochondria. Two organisms that have been extensively studied with
   regards to this enzyme are Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis. It is also found in other organisms, such as yeast and
   plants.
