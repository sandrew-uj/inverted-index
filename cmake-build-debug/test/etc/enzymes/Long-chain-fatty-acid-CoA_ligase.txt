   The long chain fatty acyl-CoA ligase (or synthetase) is an enzyme of
   the ligase family that activates the oxidation of complex fatty
   acids. Long chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the formation
   of fatty acyl-CoA by a two-step process proceeding through an
   adenylated intermediate. The enzyme catalyzes the following
   reaction,
          Fatty acid + CoA + ATP <=> Acyl-CoA + AMP + PP[i]
   It is present in all organisms from bacteria to humans. It catalyzes
   the pre-step reaction for b-oxidation of fatty acids or can be
   incorporated in phospholipids.
