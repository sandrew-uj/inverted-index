   Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase (full name
   D^1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase) is an enzyme responsible for
   catalyzing the formation of THCA from cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). THCA
   is the direct precursor of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal
   psychoactive component of cannabis, which is produced from various
   strains of Cannabis sativa. Therefore, THCA synthase is considered to
   be a key enzyme controlling cannabis psychoactivity. Polymorphisms
   of THCA synthase result in varying levels of THC in Cannabis plants,
   resulting in "drug-type" and "fiber-type" C. sativa varieties.
