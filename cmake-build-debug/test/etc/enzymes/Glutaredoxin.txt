   Glutaredoxins (also known as Thioltransferase) are small
   redox enzymes of approximately one hundred amino-acid residues that use
   glutathione as a cofactor. In humans this oxidation repair enzyme is
   also known to participate in many cellular functions, including redox
   signaling and regulation of glucose metabolism. Glutaredoxins
   are oxidized by substrates, and reduced non-enzymatically by
   glutathione. In contrast to thioredoxins, which are reduced by
   thioredoxin reductase, no oxidoreductase exists that specifically
   reduces glutaredoxins. Instead, glutaredoxins are reduced by the
   oxidation of glutathione. Oxidized glutathione is then regenerated by
   glutathione reductase. Together these components compose the
   glutathione system.
   Like thioredoxin, which functions in a similar way, glutaredoxin
   possesses an active centre disulfide bond. It exists in either a
   reduced or an oxidized form where the two cysteine residues are linked
   in an intramolecular disulfide bond. Glutaredoxins function as electron
   carriers in the glutathione-dependent synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides
   by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Moreover, GRX act in
   antioxidant defense by reducing dehydroascorbate, peroxiredoxins, and
   methionine sulfoxide reductase. Beside their function in antioxidant
   defense, bacterial and plant GRX were shown to bind iron-sulfur
   clusters and to deliver the cluster to enzymes on demand.
