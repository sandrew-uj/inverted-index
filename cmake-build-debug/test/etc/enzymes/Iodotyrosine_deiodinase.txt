   Iodotyrosine deiodinase, also known as iodotyrosine dehalogenase 1, is
   a type of deiodinase enzyme that scavenges iodide by removing it from
   iodinated tyrosine residues in the thyroid gland. These iodinated
   tyrosines are produced during thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The
   iodide that is scavenged by iodotyrosine deiodinase is necessary to
   again synthesize the thyroid hormones. After synthesis, the thyroid
   hormones circulate through the body to regulate metabolic rate, protein
   expression, and body temperature. Iodotyrosine deiodinase is thus
   necessary to keep levels of both iodide and thyroid hormones in
   balance.
   Dehalogenation in aerobic organisms is usually done through oxidation
   and hydrolysis; however, iodotyrosine deiodinase uses reductive
   dehalogenation. Iodotyrosine deiodinase and iodothyronine deiodinase
   have been determined as the only two known enzymes to catalyze
   reductive dehalogenation in mammals. Although these two enzymes
   perform similar functions, they are structurally and mechanistically
   different. Iodothyronine deiodinase (not the enzyme that is the topic
   of this article) uses a selenocysteine active site for catalysis, is a
   member of the thioredoxin superfamily, and removes iodide only when the
   substrate is in a double-tyrosine form. By contrast, iodotyrosine
   deiodinase (the topic enzyme) does not require selenocysteine or
   cysteine for catalysis, is part of the NADH oxidase/flavin
   reductase superfamily, and removes iodide when the substrate
   is a single amino acid. Research on iodotyrosine deiodinase has
   historically been variable and slow due to its lack of stability and
   arduous purification. Only recently has this enzyme been studied
   more deeply.
