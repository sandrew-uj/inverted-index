   In enzymology, maleylacetoacetate isomerase (EC 5.2.1.2) is an enzyme
   that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          4-maleylacetoacetate
           4-fumarylacetoacetate
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans
   isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   4-maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase.
   4-Maleylacetoacetate isomerase is an enzyme involved in the degradation
   of L-phenylalanine. It is encoded by the gene glutathione S-transferase
   zeta 1, or GSTZ1. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of
   4-maleylacetoacetate to 4-fumarylacetoacetate. 4-Maleylacetoacetate
   isomerase belongs to the zeta class of the glutathione S-transferase
   (GST) superfamily.

   4-maleylacetoacetate isomerase, highlighting the glutathione binding
   site.
