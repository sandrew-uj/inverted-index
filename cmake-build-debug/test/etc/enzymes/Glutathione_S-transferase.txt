   Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), previously known as ligandins, are a
   family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic phase II metabolic isozymes best
   known for their ability to catalyze the conjugation of the reduced form
   of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic substrates for the purpose of
   detoxification. The GST family consists of three superfamilies: the
   cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal--also known as
   MAPEG--proteins. Members of the GST superfamily are
   extremely diverse in amino acid sequence, and a large fraction of the
   sequences deposited in public databases are of unknown function.
   The Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) is using GSTs as a model
   superfamily to identify new GST functions.
   GSTs can constitute up to 10% of cytosolic protein in some mammalian
   organs. GSTs catalyse the conjugation of GSH--via a sulfhydryl
   group--to electrophilic centers on a wide variety of substrates in
   order to make the compounds more water-soluble. This activity
   detoxifies endogenous compounds such as peroxidised lipids and enables
   the breakdown of xenobiotics. GSTs may also bind toxins and function as
   transport proteins, which gave rise to the early term for GSTs,
   ligandin.
