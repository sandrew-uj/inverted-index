   Helicases are a class of enzymes thought to be vital to all organisms.
   Their main function is to unpack an organism's genes. They are motor
   proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester
   backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands such as DNA and
   RNA (hence helic- + -ase), using energy from ATP hydrolysis. There are
   many helicases, representing the great variety of processes in which
   strand separation must be catalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic
   genes code for helicases. The human genome codes for 95
   non-redundant helicases: 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases.
   Many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription,
   translation, recombination, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis involve
   the separation of nucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of
   helicases.
