   A mutase is an enzyme of the isomerase class that catalyzes the
   movement of a functional group from one position to another within the
   same molecule. In other words, mutases catalyze intramolecular
   group transfers. Examples of mutases include bisphosphoglycerate
   mutase, which appears in red blood cells and phosphoglycerate mutase,
   which is an enzyme integral to glycolysis. In glycolysis, it changes
   3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate. In particular it moves
   phosphate groups within a single molecule, for instance:
   phosphoglycerate mutase.
