   Cytochrome P450 3A4 (abbreviated CYP3A4) (EC 1.14.13.97) is an
   important enzyme in the body, mainly found in the liver and in the
   intestine. It oxidizes small foreign organic molecules (xenobiotics),
   such as toxins or drugs, so that they can be removed from the body.
   While many drugs are deactivated by CYP3A4, there are also some drugs
   which are activated by the enzyme. Some substances, such as some drugs
   and furanocoumarins present in grapefruit juice, interfere with the
   action of CYP3A4. These substances will therefore either amplify or
   weaken the action of those drugs that are modified by CYP3A4.
   CYP3A4 is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of oxidizing enzymes.
   Several other members of this family are also involved in drug
   metabolism, but CYP3A4 is the most common and the most versatile one.
   Like all members of this family, it is a hemoprotein, i.e. a protein
   containing a heme group with an iron atom. In humans, the CYP3A4
   protein is encoded by the CYP3A4 gene. This gene is part of a
   cluster of cytochrome P[450] genes on chromosome 7q22.1.
