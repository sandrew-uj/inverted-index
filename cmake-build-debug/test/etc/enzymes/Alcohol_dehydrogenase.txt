   Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) (EC 1.1.1.1) are a group of dehydrogenase
   enzymes that occur in many organisms and facilitate the interconversion
   between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of
   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD^+) to NADH. In humans and many
   other animals, they serve to break down alcohols that otherwise are
   toxic, and they also participate in generation of useful aldehyde,
   ketone, or alcohol groups during biosynthesis of various metabolites.
   In yeast, plants, and many bacteria, some alcohol dehydrogenases
   catalyze the opposite reaction as part of fermentation to ensure a
   constant supply of NAD^+.
