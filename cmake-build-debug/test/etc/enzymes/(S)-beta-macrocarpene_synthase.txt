   (S)-beta-macrocarpene synthase (EC 5.5.1.17, TPS6, TPS11) is an enzyme
   with systematic name (S)-beta-macrocarpene lyase (decyclizing).
   This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction
          (S)-beta-bisabolene
           (S)-beta-macrocarpene
   The synthesis of (S)-beta-macrocarpene from (2E,6E)-farnesyl
   diphosphate proceeds in two steps.
