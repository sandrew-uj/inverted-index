   NADH dehydrogenase is an enzyme that converts nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide (NAD) from its reduced form (NADH) to its oxidized form
   (NAD^+). Members of the NADH dehydrogenase family and analogues are
   commonly systematically named using the format NADH:acceptor
   oxidoreductase. The chemical reaction these enzymes
   catalyze are generally represented with the follow equation;
          NADH + H^+ + acceptor <=> NAD^+ + reduced acceptor
   NADH dehydrogenase is a flavoprotein that contains iron-sulfur centers.
   NADH dehydrogenase is used in the electron transport chain for
   generation of ATP.
