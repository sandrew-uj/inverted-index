   Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8.
   It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly
   reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides
   with most elements as well as with other compounds. After hydrogen and
   helium, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe by
   mass. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element
   bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the
   formula O^
   [2]. Diatomic oxygen gas currently constitutes 20.95% of the Earth's
   atmosphere, though this has changed considerably over long periods of
   time. Oxygen makes up almost half of the Earth's crust in the form of
   oxides.
   Dioxygen provides the energy released in combustion and aerobic
   cellular respiration, and many major classes of organic molecules
   in living organisms contain oxygen atoms, such as proteins, nucleic
   acids, carbohydrates, and fats, as do the major constituent inorganic
   compounds of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living
   organisms is oxygen as a component of water, the major constituent of
   lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by
   photosynthesis, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen
   from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to
   remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by
   the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (allotrope)
   of oxygen, ozone (O^
   [3]), strongly absorbs ultraviolet UVB radiation and the high-altitude
   ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation.
   However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a
   pollutant.
   Oxygen was isolated by Michael Sendivogius before 1604, but it is
   commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by Carl
   Wilhelm Scheele, in Uppsala, in 1773 or earlier, and Joseph Priestley
   in Wiltshire, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because
   his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen
   "dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a chemical element.
   The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier, who first
   recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the
   role it plays in combustion.
   Common uses of oxygen include production of steel, plastics and
   textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals,
   rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and life support systems in
   aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.
