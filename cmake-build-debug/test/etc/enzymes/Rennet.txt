   Rennet (/|rEnIt/) is a complex set of enzymes produced in the stomachs
   of ruminant mammals. Chymosin, its key component, is a protease enzyme
   that curdles the casein in milk. In addition to chymosin, rennet
   contains other enzymes, such as pepsin and a lipase.
   Rennet is used to separate milk into solid curds (for cheesemaking) and
   liquid whey, and so it or a substitute is used in the production of
   most cheeses.
