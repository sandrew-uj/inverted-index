   In enzymology, an iron--cytochrome-c reductase (created 1972 as EC
   1.9.99.1, transferred 2014 to EC 1.9.98.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes
   the chemical reaction
          ferrocytochrome c + Fe^3+
           ferricytochrome c + Fe^2+
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ferrocytochrome c and
   Fe^3+, whereas its two products are ferricytochrome c and Fe^2+.
