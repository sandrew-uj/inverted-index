   Chemical compound
   Trypsinogen (/trIp|sIn@dZ@n, -dZEn/) is the precursor form (or
   zymogen) of trypsin, a digestive enzyme. It is produced by the pancreas
   and found in pancreatic juice, along with amylase, lipase, and
   chymotrypsinogen. It is cleaved to its active form, trypsin, by
   enteropeptidase, which is found in the intestinal mucosa. Once
   activated, the trypsin can cleave more trypsinogen into trypsin, a
   process called autoactivation. Trypsin cleaves the peptide bond on the
   carboxyl side of basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine.
