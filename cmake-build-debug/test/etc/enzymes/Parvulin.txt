   Parvulin, a 92-amino acid protein discovered in E. coli in 1994, is
   the smallest known protein with prolyl isomerase activity, which
   catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline peptide bonds.
   Although parvulin has no homology with larger prolyl isomerases such as
   cyclophilin and FKBP, it does share structural features with subdomains
   of other proteins involved in preparing secreted proteins for export
   from the cell.
   Although parvulin is as active as the larger prolyl isomerases against
   a short proline-containing test peptide, it has lower relative activity
   against biological substrates, possibly because the larger molecules
   have a higher ability to bind the substrate peptide. Parvulin
   itself contains proline residues and its folding can be accelerated by
   the presence of cyclophilin; parvulin folding can also be
   autocatalytic.
   A eukaryotic homolog of parvulin known as Pin1 is required to execute
   the transition from G2 phase to M phase in the cell cycle. Absence
   of Pin1 activity in humans has also been implicated in the folding and
   processing of the amyloid precursor protein, whose degradation product
   is the cytotoxic peptide amyloid beta implicated in Alzheimer's
   disease.
   In addition to Pin1, higher eukaryotes contain an additional parvulin
   gene, whose core sequence is highly conserved in all multi-cellular
   organisms examined so far, but absent from yeast. In humans the locus
   of this parvulin resides on chromosome Xq13 and encodes two protein
   species, Par14 and Par17. Par17, which is exclusively
   expressed in hominids and humans, is an N-terminal extended version of
   Par14 and results from alternative transcription initiation.
