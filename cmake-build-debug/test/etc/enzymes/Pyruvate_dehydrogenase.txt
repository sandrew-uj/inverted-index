   Pyruvate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of
   pyruvate and a lipoamide to give the acetylated dihydrolipoamide and
   carbon dioxide. The conversion requires the coenzyme thiamine
   pyrophosphate.

   Pyruvate dehydrogenase is usually encountered as a component, referred
   to as E1, of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC consists of
   other enzymes, referred to as E2 and E3. Collectively E1-E3 transform
   pyruvate, NAD^+, coenzyme A into acetyl-CoA, CO[2], and NADH. The
   conversion is crucial because acetyl-CoA may then be used in the citric
   acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration. To distinguish
   between this enzyme and the PDC, it is systematically called pyruvate
   dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring).
