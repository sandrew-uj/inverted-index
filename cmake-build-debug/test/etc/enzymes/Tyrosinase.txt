   Tyrosinase is an oxidase that is the rate-limiting enzyme for
   controlling the production of melanin. The enzyme is mainly involved in
   two distinct reactions of melanin synthesis otherwise known as the
   Raper Mason pathway. Firstly, the hydroxylation of a monophenol and
   secondly, the conversion of an o-diphenol to the corresponding
   o-quinone. o-Quinone undergoes several reactions to eventually form
   melanin. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing enzyme present in plant
   and animal tissues that catalyzes the production of melanin and other
   pigments from tyrosine by oxidation. It is found inside melanosomes
   which are synthesized in the skin melanocytes. In humans, the
   tyrosinase enzyme is encoded by the TYR gene.
