   The enzyme UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2), also known as
   UDP-galactose 4-epimerase or GALE, is a homodimeric epimerase found in
   bacterial, fungal, plant, and mammalian cells. This enzyme performs the
   final step in the Leloir pathway of galactose metabolism, catalyzing
   the reversible conversion of UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose. GALE
   tightly binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a co-factor
   required for catalytic activity.
   Additionally, human and some bacterial GALE isoforms reversibly
   catalyze the formation of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) from
   UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in the presence of NAD+, an
   initial step in glycoprotein or glycolipid synthesis.
