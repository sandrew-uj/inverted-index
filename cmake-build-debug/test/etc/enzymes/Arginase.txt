   Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1, arginine amidinase, canavanase, L-arginase,
   arginine transamidinase) is a manganese-containing enzyme. The reaction
   catalyzed by this enzyme is: arginine + H[2]O -> ornithine + urea. It
   is the final enzyme of the urea cycle. It is ubiquitous to all domains
   of life.
