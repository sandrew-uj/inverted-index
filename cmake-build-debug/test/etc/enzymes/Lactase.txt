   Lactase is an enzyme produced by many organisms. It is located in the
   brush border of the small intestine of humans and other mammals.
   Lactase is essential to the complete digestion of whole milk; it breaks
   down lactose, a sugar which gives milk its sweetness. Lacking lactase,
   a person consuming dairy products may experience the symptoms of
   lactose intolerance. Lactase can be purchased as a food supplement,
   and is added to milk to produce "lactose-free" milk products.
   Lactase (also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, or LPH), a part of
   the b-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a glycoside hydrolase
   involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent
   galactose and glucose monomers. Lactase is present predominantly along
   the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the
   villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the
   LCT gene.
