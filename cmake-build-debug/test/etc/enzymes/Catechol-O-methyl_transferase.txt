   Norepinephrine degradation. Catechol-O-methyltransferase is shown in
   green boxes.
   Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; EC 2.1.1.6) is one of several
   enzymes that degrade catecholamines (neurotransmitters such as
   dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine), catecholestrogens, and
   various drugs and substances having a catechol structure. In
   humans, catechol-O-methyltransferase protein is encoded by the COMT
   gene. Two isoforms of COMT are produced: the soluble short form
   (S-COMT) and the membrane bound long form (MB-COMT). As the regulation
   of catecholamines is impaired in a number of medical conditions,
   several pharmaceutical drugs target COMT to alter its activity and
   therefore the availability of catecholamines. COMT was first
   discovered by the biochemist Julius Axelrod in 1957.
