   Cyclophilins (CYPs) are a family of proteins named after their ability
   to bind to ciclosporin (cyclosporin A), an immunosuppressant which is
   usually used to suppress rejection after internal organ
   transplants. They are found in all domains of life. These proteins
   have peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity, which catalyzes the
   isomerization of peptide bonds from trans form to cis form at proline
   residues and facilitates protein folding.
   Cyclophilin A is a cytosolic and highly abundant protein. The protein
   belongs to a family of isozymes, including cyclophilins B and C, and
   natural killer cell cyclophilin-related protein. Major
   isoforms have been found within single cells, including inside the
   Endoplasmic reticulum, and some are even secreted.
