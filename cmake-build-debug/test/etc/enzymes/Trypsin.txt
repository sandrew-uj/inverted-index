   Trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) is a serine protease from the PA clan
   superfamily, found in the digestive system of many vertebrates, where
   it hydrolyzes proteins. Trypsin is formed in the small
   intestine when its proenzyme form, the trypsinogen produced by the
   pancreas, is activated. Trypsin cuts peptide chains mainly at the
   carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine or arginine. It is used for
   numerous biotechnological processes. The process is commonly referred
   to as trypsin proteolysis or trypsinization, and proteins that have
   been digested/treated with trypsin are said to have been
   trypsinized. Trypsin was discovered in 1876 by Wilhelm Kuehne and
   was named from the Ancient Greek word for rubbing since it was first
   isolated by rubbing the pancreas with glycerin.
