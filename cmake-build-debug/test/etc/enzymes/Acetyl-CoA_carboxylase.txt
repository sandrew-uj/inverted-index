   Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a biotin-dependent enzyme that
   catalyzes the irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce
   malonyl-CoA through its two catalytic activities, biotin carboxylase
   (BC) and carboxyltransferase (CT). ACC is a multi-subunit enzyme in
   most prokaryotes and in the chloroplasts of most plants and algae,
   whereas it is a large, multi-domain enzyme in the cytoplasm of most
   eukaryotes. The most important function of ACC is to provide the
   malonyl-CoA substrate for the biosynthesis of fatty acids. The
   activity of ACC can be controlled at the transcriptional level as well
   as by small molecule modulators and covalent modification. The human
   genome contains the genes for two different ACCs--ACACA and
   ACACB.
