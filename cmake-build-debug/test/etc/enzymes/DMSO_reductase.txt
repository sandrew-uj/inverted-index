   DMSO reductase is a molybdenum-containing enzyme that catalyzes
   reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to dimethyl sulfide (DMS). This
   enzyme serves as the terminal reductase under anaerobic conditions in
   some bacteria, with DMSO being the terminal electron acceptor. During
   the course of the reaction, the oxygen atom in DMSO is transferred to
   molybdenum, and then reduced to water.
   The reaction catalyzed by DMSO reductase.
   DMSO reductase (DMSOR) and other members of the DMSO reductase family
   are unique to bacteria and archaea. Enzymes of this family in anaerobic
   oxidative phosphorylation and inorganic-donor-based lithotrophic
   respiration. These enzymes have been engineered to degrade
   oxoanions. DMSOR catalyzes the transfer of two electrons
   and one oxygen atom in the reaction: The active site of DMSOR contains
   molybdenum, which is otherwise rare in biology.
