   4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), also known as
   a-ketoisocaproate dioxygenase (KIC dioxygenase), is an
   Fe(II)-containing non-heme oxygenase that catalyzes the second reaction
   in the catabolism of tyrosine - the conversion of
   4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into homogentisate. HPPD also catalyzes the
   conversion of phenylpyruvate to 2-hydroxyphenylacetate and the
   conversion of a-ketoisocaproate to b-hydroxy b-methylbutyrate.
   HPPD is an enzyme that is found in nearly all aerobic forms of
   life.
   This reaction shows the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate into
   homogentisate by HPPD.
