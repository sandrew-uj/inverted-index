   Tissue plasminogen activator (abbreviated tPA or PLAT) is a protein
   involved in the breakdown of blood clots. It is a serine protease (EC
   3.4.21.68) found on endothelial cells, the cells that line the blood
   vessels. As an enzyme, it catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to
   plasmin, the major enzyme responsible for clot breakdown. Human tPA has
   a molecular weight of ~70 kDa in the single-chain form.
   tPA can be manufactured using recombinant biotechnology techniques; tPA
   produced by such means are referred to as recombinant tissue
   plasminogen activator (rtPA). Specific rtPAs include alteplase,
   reteplase, and tenecteplase. They are used in clinical medicine to
   treat embolic or thrombotic stroke. The use of this protein is
   contraindicated in hemorrhagic stroke and head trauma. The antidote for
   tPA in case of toxicity is aminocaproic acid.
