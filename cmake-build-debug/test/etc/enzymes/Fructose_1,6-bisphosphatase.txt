   Fructose bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) is an enzyme that converts
   fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in gluconeogenesis
   and the Calvin cycle which are both anabolic pathways. Fructose
   bisphosphatase catalyses the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to
   fructose-6-phosphate, which is the reverse of the reaction which is
   catalysed by phosphofructokinase in glycolysis. These enzymes
   only catalyse the reaction in one direction each, and are regulated by
   metabolites such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate so that high activity of
   one of the two enzymes is accompanied by low activity of the other.
   More specifically, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosterically inhibits
   fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, but activates phosphofructokinase-I.
   Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is involved in many different metabolic
   pathways and found in most organisms. FBPase requires metal ions for
   catalysis (Mg^2+ and Mn^2+ being preferred) and the enzyme is potently
   inhibited by Li^+.
