   A transferase is any one of a class of enzymes that enact the transfer
   of specific functional groups (e.g. a methyl or glycosyl group) from
   one molecule (called the donor) to another (called the acceptor).
   They are involved in hundreds of different biochemical pathways
   throughout biology, and are integral to some of life's most important
   processes.
   Transferases are involved in myriad reactions in the cell. Three
   examples of these reactions are the activity of coenzyme A (CoA)
   transferase, which transfers thiol esters, the action of
   N-acetyltransferase, which is part of the pathway that metabolizes
   tryptophan, and the regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
   which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA. Transferases are also
   utilized during translation. In this case, an amino acid chain is the
   functional group transferred by a peptidyl transferase. The transfer
   involves the removal of the growing amino acid chain from the tRNA
   molecule in the A-site of the ribosome and its subsequent addition to
   the amino acid attached to the tRNA in the P-site.
   Mechanistically, an enzyme that catalyzed the following reaction would
   be a transferase:
   Xgroup+Y{[ {transferase}]{}}X+Ygroup
   In the above reaction, X would be the donor, and Y would be the
   acceptor. "Group" would be the functional group transferred as a
   result of transferase activity. The donor is often a coenzyme.
