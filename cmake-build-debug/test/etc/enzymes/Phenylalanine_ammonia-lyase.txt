   Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.24) is an enzyme that catalyzes a
   reaction converting L-phenylalanine to ammonia and trans-cinnamic
   acid. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) is the first and committed
   step in the phenyl propanoid pathway and is therefore involved in the
   biosynthesis of the polyphenol compounds such as flavonoids,
   phenylpropanoids, and lignin in plants. Phenylalanine ammonia
   lyase is found widely in plants, as well as some bacteria, yeast, and
   fungi, with isoenzymes existing within many different species. It has a
   molecular mass in the range of 270-330 kDa. The activity of PAL
   is induced dramatically in response to various stimuli such as tissue
   wounding, pathogenic attack, light, low temperatures, and
   hormones. PAL has recently been studied for possible
   therapeutic benefits in humans afflicted with phenylketonuria. It
   has also been used in the generation of L-phenylalanine as precursor of
   the sweetener aspartame.
   The enzyme is a member of the ammonia lyase family, which cleaves
   carbon-nitrogen bonds. Like other lyases, PAL requires only one
   substrate for the forward reaction, but two for the reverse. It is
   thought to be mechanistically similar to the related enzyme histidine
   ammonia-lyase (EC:4.3.1.3, HAL). The systematic name of this enzyme
   class is L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (trans-cinnamate-forming).
   Previously, it was designated EC 4.3.1.5, but that class has been
   redesignated as EC 4.3.1.24 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyases), EC 4.3.1.25
   (tyrosine ammonia-lyases), and EC 4.3.1.26 (phenylalanine/tyrosine
   ammonia-lyases). Other names in common use include tyrase,
   phenylalanine deaminase, tyrosine ammonia-lyase, L-tyrosine
   ammonia-lyase, phenylalanine ammonium-lyase, PAL, and L-phenylalanine
   ammonia-lyase.
