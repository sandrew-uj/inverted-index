   Plasmepsins are a class of at least 10 enzymes (EC 3.4.23.38 and EC
   3.4.23.39) produced by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. There are
   ten different isoforms of these proteins and ten genes coding them
   respectively in Plasmodium (Plm I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X and
   HAP). It has been suggested that the plasmepsin family is smaller in
   other human Plasmodium species. Expression of Plm I, II, IV, V, IX, X
   and HAP occurs in the erythrocytic cycle, and expression of Plm VI,
   VII, VIII, occurs in the exoerythrocytic cycle. Through their
   haemoglobin-degrading activity, they are an important cause of symptoms
   in malaria sufferers. Consequently, this family of enzymes is a
   potential target for antimalarial drugs.
   Plasmepsins are aspartic acid proteases, meaning their active site
   contains two aspartic acid residues. These two aspartic acid residue
   act respectively as proton donor and proton acceptor, catalysing the
   hydrolysis of peptide bond in proteins.
   There are four types of plasmepsins, closely related but varying in the
   specificity of cleavage site. Plasmepsins I and II cleave hemoglobin
   between residues Phenylalanine 33 and Leucine 34 of a-globin subunit.
   The name plasmepsin may come from Plasmodium (the organism) and pepsin
   (a common aspartic acid protease with similar molecular structure).
   The closest (non-pathogenic) enzymatic equivalent in humans is the
   beta-secretase enzyme.
