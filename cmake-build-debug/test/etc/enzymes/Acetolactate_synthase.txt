   The acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme (also known as acetohydroxy acid
   synthase, or AHAS) is a protein found in plants and micro-organisms.
   ALS catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of the branched-chain
   amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine).
   A human protein of yet unknown function, sharing some sequence
   similarity with bacterial ALS, is encoded by the ILVBL (ilvB-like)
   gene.
