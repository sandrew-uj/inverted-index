   Sucrase is a digestive enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose
   to its subunits fructose and glucose. One form, sucrase-isomaltase, is
   secreted in the small intestine on the brush border. The sucrase
   enzyme invertase, which occurs more commonly in plants, also hydrolyzes
   sucrose but by a different mechanism.
