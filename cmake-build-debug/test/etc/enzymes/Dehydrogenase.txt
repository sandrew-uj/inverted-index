   A dehydrogenase is an enzyme belonging to the group of oxidoreductases
   that oxidizes a substrate by reducing an electron acceptor, usually
   NAD^+/NADP^+ or a flavin coenzyme such as FAD or FMN. Like all
   catalysts, they catalyze reverse as well as forward reactions, and in
   some cases this has physiological significance: for example, alcohol
   dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxididation of ethanol to acetaldehyde in
   animals, but in yeast it catalyzes the production of ethanol from
   acetaldehyde.
