   Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (EC 3.1.1.34) is a member of the lipase gene
   family, which includes pancreatic lipase, hepatic lipase, and
   endothelial lipase. It is a water-soluble enzyme that hydrolyzes
   triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as those found in chylomicrons and
   very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), into two free fatty acids and one
   monoacylglycerol molecule. It is also involved in promoting the
   cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins,
   and free fatty acids. LPL requires ApoC-II as a
   cofactor.
   LPL is attached to the luminal surface of endothelial cells in
   capillaries by the protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol HDL-binding
   protein 1 (GPIHBP1) and by heparan sulfated peptidoglycans. It is
   most widely distributed in adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle tissue,
   as well as in lactating mammary glands.
