   3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase (EC 6.2.1.36, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
   synthetase (AMP-forming), 3-hydroxypropionate-CoA ligase) is an enzyme
   with systematic name hydroxypropionate:CoA ligase
   (AMP-forming). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical
   reaction
          3-hydroxypropionate + ATP + CoA
           3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate
   This enzyme catalyses a step in the
   3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle.
