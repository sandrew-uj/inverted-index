   Na^+/K^+-ATPase (sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase, also known
   as the Na^+/K^+ pump or sodium-potassium pump) is an enzyme (an
   electrogenic transmembrane ATPase) found in the membrane of all animal
   cells. It performs several functions in cell physiology.
   The Na^+/K^+-ATPase enzyme is active (i.e. it uses energy from ATP).
   For every ATP molecule that the pump uses, three sodium ions are
   exported and two potassium ions are imported; there is hence a net
   export of a single positive charge per pump cycle.
   The sodium-potassium pump was discovered in 1957 by the Danish
   scientist Jens Christian Skou, who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his
   work in 1997. Its discovery marked an important step forward in the
   understanding of how ions get into and out of cells, and it has
   particular significance for excitable cells such as nerve cells, which
   depend on this pump to respond to stimuli and transmit impulses.
   All mammals have four different sodium pump sub-types, or isoforms.
   Each has unique properties and tissue expression patterns. This
   enzyme belongs to the family of P-type ATPases.
