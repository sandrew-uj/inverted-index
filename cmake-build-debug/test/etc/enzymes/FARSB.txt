   Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase beta chain is an enzyme that in humans is
   encoded by the FARSB gene.
   This gene encodes a highly conserved enzyme that belongs to the
   aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase class IIc subfamily. This enzyme comprises
   the regulatory beta subunits that form a tetramer with two catalytic
   alpha subunits. In the presence of ATP, this tetramer is responsible
   for attaching L-phenylalanine to the terminal adenosine of the
   appropriate tRNA. A pseudogene located on chromosome 10 has been
   identified.
