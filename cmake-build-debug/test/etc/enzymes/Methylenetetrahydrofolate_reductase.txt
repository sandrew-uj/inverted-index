   Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the rate-limiting
   enzyme in the methyl cycle, and it is encoded by the MTHFR gene.
   Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase catalyzes the conversion of
   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a
   cosubstrate for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Natural
   variation in this gene is common in otherwise healthy people. Although
   some variants have been reported to influence susceptibility to
   occlusive vascular disease, neural tube defects, Alzheimer's disease
   and other forms of dementia, colon cancer, and acute leukemia, findings
   from small early studies have not been reproduced. Some mutations in
   this gene are associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
   deficiency. Complex I deficiency with recessive spastic
   paraparesis has also been linked to MTHFR variants. In addition, the
   aberrant promoter hypermethylation of this gene is associated with male
   infertility and recurrent spontaneous abortion.
