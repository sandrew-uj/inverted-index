   Cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH or CSE; also cystathionase) is an enzyme
   which breaks down cystathionine into cysteine, a-ketobutyrate, and
   ammonia. Pyridoxal phosphate is a prosthetic group of this
   enzyme.
   Cystathionine gamma-lyase also catalyses the following elimination
   reactions:
     * L-homoserine to form H[2]O, NH[3] and 2-oxobutanoate
     * L-cystine, producing thiocysteine, pyruvate and NH[3]
     * L-cysteine producing pyruvate, NH[3] and H[2]S
   In some bacteria and mammals, including humans, this enzyme takes part
   in generating hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is one of a
   few gases that was recently discovered to have a role in cell signaling
   in the body.
