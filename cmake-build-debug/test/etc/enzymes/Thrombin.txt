   Schematic diagram of the blood coagulation and protein C pathways. In
   the blood coagulation pathway, thrombin acts to convert factor XI to
   XIa, VIII to VIIIa V to Va, fibrinogen to fibrin. In addition, thrombin
   promotes platelet activation and aggregation via activation of
   protease-activated receptors on the cell membrane of the platelet.
   Thrombin also cross over into the protein C pathway by converting
   protein C into APC. APC in turn converts factor V into Vi, and VIIIa
   into VIIIi. Finally APC activates PAR-1 and EPCR.
   Role of thrombin in the blood coagulation cascade
   Thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5, fibrinogenase, thrombase, thrombofort, topical,
   thrombin-C, tropostasin, activated blood-coagulation factor II,
   blood-coagulation factor IIa, factor IIa, E thrombin, beta-thrombin,
   gamma-thrombin) is a serine protease, an enzyme that, in humans, is
   encoded by the F2 gene. Prothrombin (coagulation factor II) is
   proteolytically cleaved to form thrombin in the clotting process.
   Thrombin in turn acts as a serine protease that converts soluble
   fibrinogen into insoluble strands of fibrin, as well as catalyzing many
   other coagulation-related reactions.
