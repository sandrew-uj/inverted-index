   A methyl group is an alkyl derived from methane, containing one carbon
   atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms -- CH[3]. In formulas, the group is
   often abbreviated Me. Such hydrocarbon groups occur in many organic
   compounds. It is a very stable group in most molecules. While the
   methyl group is usually part of a larger molecule, it can be found on
   its own in any of three forms: anion, cation or radical. The anion has
   eight valence electrons, the radical seven and the cation six. All
   three forms are highly reactive and rarely observed.
