   Iodothyronine deiodinases (EC 1.21.99.4 and EC 1.21.99.3) are a
   subfamily of deiodinase enzymes important in the activation and
   deactivation of thyroid hormones. Thyroxine (T[4]), the precursor of
   3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T[3]) is transformed into T[3] by deiodinase
   activity. T[3], through binding a nuclear thyroid hormone receptor,
   influences the expression of genes in practically every vertebrate
   cell. Iodothyronine deiodinases are unusual in that these
   enzymes contain selenium, in the form of an otherwise rare amino acid
   selenocysteine.
   These enzymes are not to be confused with the iodotyrosine deiodinases
   that are also deiodinases, but not members of the iodothyronine family.
   The iodotyrosine deiodinases (unlike the iodothyronine deiodinases) do
   not use selenocysteine or selenium. The iodotyrosine enzymes work on
   iodinated single tyrosine residue molecules to scavenge iodine, and do
   not use as substrates the double-tyrosine residue molecules of the
   various iodothyronines.
