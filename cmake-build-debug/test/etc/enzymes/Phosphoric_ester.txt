   An ester is a chemical compound derived from an acid (organic or
   inorganic) in which at least one -OH hydroxyl group is replaced by an
   -O- alkyl (alkoxy) group, as in the substitution reaction of a
   carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Glycerides are fatty acid esters of
   glycerol; they are important in biology, being one of the main classes
   of lipids and comprising the bulk of animal fats and vegetable oils.
   Esters typically have a nice smell; those of low molecular weight are
   commonly used as fragrances and are found in essential oils and
   pheromones. They perform as high-grade solvents for a broad array of
   plastics, plasticizers, resins, and lacquers, and are one of the
   largest classes of synthetic lubricants on the commercial market.
   Polyesters are important plastics, with monomers linked by ester
   moieties. Phosphoesters form the backbone of DNA molecules. Nitrate
   esters, such as nitroglycerin, are known for their explosive
   properties.
