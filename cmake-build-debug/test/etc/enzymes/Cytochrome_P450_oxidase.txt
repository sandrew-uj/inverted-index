   Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are a superfamily of enzymes containing heme as
   a cofactor that functions as monooxygenases. In mammals,
   these proteins oxidize steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics, and are
   important for the clearance of various compounds, as well as for
   hormone synthesis and breakdown. In plants, these proteins are
   important for the biosynthesis of defensive compounds, fatty acids, and
   hormones.
   CYP enzymes have been identified in all kingdoms of life: animals,
   plants, fungi, protists, bacteria, and archaea, as well as in
   viruses. However, they are not omnipresent; for example, they have
   not been found in Escherichia coli. As of 2018^[update], more
   than 300,000 distinct CYP proteins are known.
   CYPs are, in general, the terminal oxidase enzymes in electron transfer
   chains, broadly categorized as P450-containing systems. The term "P450"
   is derived from the spectrophotometric peak at the wavelength of the
   absorption maximum of the enzyme (450 nm) when it is in the reduced
   state and complexed with carbon monoxide. Most CYPs require a protein
   partner to deliver one or more electrons to reduce the iron (and
   eventually molecular oxygen).
