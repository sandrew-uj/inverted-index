   In enzymology, an Oplophorus-luciferin 2-monooxygenase (EC 1.13.12.13),
   also known as Oplophorus luciferase (referred in this article as OpLuc)
   is a luciferase, an enzyme, from the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus
   gracilirostris [2], belonging to a group of coelenterazine luciferases.
   Unlike other luciferases, it has a broader substrate specificity
   [3,4,6] and can also bind to bisdeoxycoelenterazine efficiently [3,4].
   It is the third example of a luciferase (Other than Aequorea and
   Renilla) to be purified in lab [2]. The systematic name of this enzyme
   class is Oplophorus-luciferin:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase
   (decarboxylating). This enzyme is also called Oplophorus luciferase.
