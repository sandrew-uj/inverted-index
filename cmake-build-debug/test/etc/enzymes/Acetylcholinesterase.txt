   Acetylcholinesterase (HGNC symbol ACHE; EC 3.1.1.7), also known as AChE
   or acetylhydrolase, is the primary cholinesterase in the body. It is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine and of some other
   choline esters that function as neurotransmitters. AChE is found at
   mainly neuromuscular junctions and in chemical synapses of the
   cholinergic type, where its activity serves to terminate synaptic
   transmission. It belongs to carboxylesterase family of enzymes. It is
   the primary target of inhibition by organophosphorus compounds such as
   nerve agents and pesticides.
