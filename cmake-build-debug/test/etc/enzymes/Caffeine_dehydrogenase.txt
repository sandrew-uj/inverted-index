   Caffeine dehydrogenase, commonly referred to in scientific literature
   as caffeine oxidase, (EC 1.17.5.2) is an enzyme with the systematic
   name caffeine:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. The enzyme is most well
   known for its ability to directly oxidize caffeine, a type of
   methylxanthine, to trimethyluric acid. Caffeine dehydrogenase can
   be found in bacterium Pseudomonas sp. CBB1 and in several species
   within the genera Alcaligenes, Rhodococcus, and Klebsiella.
