   Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase, Renilla luciferase, or RLuc, is a
   bioluminescent enzyme found in Renilla reniformis, belonging to a group
   of coelenterazine luciferases. Of this group of enzymes, the luciferase
   from Renilla reniformis has been the most extensively studied, and due
   to its bioluminescence requiring only molecular oxygen, has a wide
   range of applications, with uses as a reporter gene probe in cell
   culture, in vivo imaging, and various other areas of biological
   research. Recently, chimeras of RLuc have been developed and
   demonstrated to be the brightest luminescent proteins to date, and have
   proved effective in both noninvasive single-cell and whole body
   imaging.
   Note that the EC record also includes other unrelated enzymes that
   catalyze the same reaction. An example is the calcium-dependent
   photoprotein aequorin: while Rluc is in the AB hydrolase superfamily,
   aequorin is an EF hand protein. The name does not specifically
   refer to Renilla, but instead refers to Renilla-luciferin, a chemical
   also known as coelenterazine.
