   Cytochromes are redox-active proteins containing a heme, with a central
   Fe atom at its core, as a cofactor. They are involved in electron
   transport chain and redox catalysis. They are classified according to
   the type of heme and its mode of binding. Four varieties are recognized
   by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
   (IUBMB), cytochromes a, cytochromes b, cytochromes c and cytochrome
   d. Cytochrome function is linked to the reversible redox change
   from ferrous (Fe(II)) to the ferric (Fe(III)) oxidation state of the
   iron found in the heme core. In addition to the classification by
   the IUBMB into four cytochrome classes, several additional
   classifications such as cytochrome o and cytochrome P450 can be
   found in biochemical literature.
