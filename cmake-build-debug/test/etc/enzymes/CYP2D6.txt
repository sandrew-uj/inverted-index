   Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by
   the CYP2D6 gene. CYP2D6 is primarily expressed in the liver. It is also
   highly expressed in areas of the central nervous system, including the
   substantia nigra.
   CYP2D6, a member of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system,
   is one of the most important enzymes involved in the metabolism of
   xenobiotics in the body. In particular, CYP2D6 is responsible for the
   metabolism and elimination of approximately 25% of clinically used
   drugs, via the addition or removal of certain functional groups -
   specifically, hydroxylation, demethylation, and dealkylation.
   CYP2D6 also activates some prodrugs. This enzyme also metabolizes
   several endogenous substances, such as hydroxytryptamines,
   neurosteroids, and both m-tyramine and p-tyramine which CYP2D6
   metabolizes into dopamine in the brain and liver.
   Considerable variation exists in the efficiency and amount of CYP2D6
   enzyme produced between individuals. Hence, for drugs that are
   metabolized by CYP2D6 (that is, are CYP2D6 substrates), certain
   individuals will eliminate these drugs quickly (ultrarapid
   metabolizers) while others slowly (poor metabolizers). If a drug is
   metabolized too quickly, it may decrease the drug's efficacy while if
   the drug is metabolized too slowly, toxicity may result. So, the
   dose of the drug may have to be adjusted to take into account of the
   speed at which it is metabolized by CYP2D6.
   Other drugs may function as inhibitors of CYP2D6 activity or inducers
   of CYP2D6 enzyme expression that will lead to decreased or increased
   CYP2D6 activity respectively. If such a drug is taken at the same time
   as a second drug that is a CYP2D6 substrate, the first drug may affect
   the elimination rate of the second through what is known as a drug-drug
   interaction.
