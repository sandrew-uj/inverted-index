   Chemical compound
   Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a coenzyme central to
   metabolism. Found in all living cells, NAD is called a dinucleotide
   because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate
   groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine nucleobase and the other
   nicotinamide. NAD exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form,
   abbreviated as NAD^+ and NADH (H for hydrogen) respectively.
   In metabolism, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is involved in redox
   reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The
   cofactor is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD^+ is an
   oxidizing agent - it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes
   reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a reducing
   agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the
   main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular
   processes, most notably as a substrate of enzymes in adding or removing
   chemical groups to or from, respectively, proteins, in
   posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these
   functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug
   discovery.
   In organisms, NAD can be synthesized from simple building-blocks (de
   novo) from either tryptophan or aspartic acid, each a case of an amino
   acid; alternatively, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken
   up from nutritive compounds such as niacin; similar compounds are
   produced by reactions that break down the structure of NAD, providing a
   salvage pathway that "recycles" them back into their respective active
   form.
   Some NAD is converted into the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); its chemistry largely parallels that of
   NAD, though predominantly its role is as a cofactor in anabolic
   metabolism.
   The NAD^+ chemical species' superscripted addition sign reflects the
   formal charge on one of its nitrogen atoms; this species is actually a
   singly charged anion -- carrying a (negative) ionic charge of 1 --
   under conditions of physiological pH. NADH, in contrast, is a doubly
   charged anion.
