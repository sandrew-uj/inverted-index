   Protein C, also known as autoprothrombin IIA and blood coagulation
   factor XIX,^:6822 is a zymogen, the activated form of which
   plays an important role in regulating anticoagulation, inflammation,
   and cell death and maintaining the permeability of blood vessel walls
   in humans and other animals. Activated protein C (APC) performs these
   operations primarily by proteolytically inactivating proteins Factor
   V[a] and Factor VIII[a]. APC is classified as a serine protease since
   it contains a residue of serine in its active site.^:35 In humans,
   protein C is encoded by the PROC gene, which is found on chromosome
   2.
   The zymogenic form of protein C is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein
   that circulates in blood plasma. Its structure is that of a two-chain
   polypeptide consisting of a light chain and a heavy chain connected by
   a disulfide bond.^:4673 The protein C zymogen is activated when it
   binds to thrombin, another protein heavily involved in coagulation, and
   protein C's activation is greatly promoted by the presence of
   thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptors (EPCRs). Because of
   EPCR's role, activated protein C is found primarily near endothelial
   cells (i.e., those that make up the walls of blood vessels), and it is
   these cells and leukocytes (white blood cells) that APC
   affects.^:34^:3162 Because of the crucial role that protein C
   plays as an anticoagulant, those with deficiencies in protein C, or
   some kind of resistance to APC, suffer from a significantly increased
   risk of forming dangerous blood clots (thrombosis).
   Research into the clinical use of a recombinant form of human Activated
   Protein C (rhAPC) known as Drotrecogin alfa-activated, branded Xigris
   by Eli Lilly and Company, has been surrounded by controversy. Eli Lilly
   ran an aggressive marketing campaign to promote its use for people with
   severe sepsis and septic shock and sponsored the 2004 Surviving Sepsis
   Campaign Guidelines. However, a 2012 Cochrane review found that
   its use cannot be recommended since it does not improve survival and
   increases bleeding risk. In October 2011, Xigris was withdrawn
   from the market by Eli Lilly due to a higher mortality in a trial among
   adults.
