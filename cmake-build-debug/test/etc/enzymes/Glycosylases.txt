   Glycosylases (EC 3.2) are enzymes that hydrolyze glycosyl
   compounds. They are a type of hydrolase (EC 3). In turn,
   glycosylases are divided into two groups: glycosidases--enzymes that
   hydrolyze O- and S-glycosyl compounds (EC 3.2.1) -- and enzymes that
   hydrolyze N-glycosyl compounds (EC 3.2.2).
