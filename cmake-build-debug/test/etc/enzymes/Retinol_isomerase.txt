   In enzymology, a retinol isomerase (EC 5.2.1.7) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          all-trans-retinol
           11-cis-retinol
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, all-trans-retinol, and one
   product, 11-cis-retinol. These enzymes are alternatively referred to as
   retinoid isomerases.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans
   isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   all-trans-retinol 11-cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme is also called
   all-trans-retinol isomerase. This enzyme participates in retinol
   metabolism.
   In vertebrates, RPE65 is the active retinol isomerase in the visual
   cycle. A lack of RPE65 function results in congenital blindness in
   children (specifically Leber congenital amaurosis). Emixustat, a
   partial inhibitor of RPE65, is currently in FDA clinical trials for the
   treatment of age-related macular degeneration.
