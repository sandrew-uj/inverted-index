   In enzymology, bornyl diphosphate synthase (BPPS) (EC 5.5.1.8) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          geranyl diphosphate
           (+)-bornyl diphosphate
   Bornyl diphosphate synthase is involved in the biosynthesis of the
   cyclic monoterpenoid bornyl diphosphate. As seen from the reaction
   above, BPPS takes geranyl diphosphate as its only substrate and
   isomerizes into the product, (+)- bornyl diphosphate. This reaction
   comes from a general class of enzymes called terpene synthases that
   cyclize a universal precursor, geranyl diphosphate, to form varying
   monocyclic and bicyclic monoterpenes. The biochemical
   transformation of geranyl diphosphate to cyclic products occurs in a
   variety of aromatic plants, including both angiosperms and gymnosperms,
   and is used for various purposes described in sections below.
   Terpene synthases like BPPS are the primary enzymes in the formation of
   low-molecular-weight terpene metabolites. The organization of terpene
   synthases, their characteristic ability to form multiple products, and
   regulation in response to biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the
   formation of a diverse group of terpene metabolites. The structural
   diversity and complexity of terpenes generates an enormous potential
   for mediating plant-environment interactions.
   The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-bornyl-diphosphate
   lyase (decyclizing). Other names in common use include bornyl
   pyrophosphate synthase, bornyl pyrophosphate synthetase,
   (+)-bornylpyrophosphate cyclase, and geranyl-diphosphate cyclase
   (ambiguous). This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis and
   belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of
   intramolecular lyases.
