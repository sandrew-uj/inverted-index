   A restriction enzyme, restriction endonuclease, or restrictase is an
   enzyme that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition
   sites within molecules known as restriction sites.
   Restriction enzymes are one class of the broader endonuclease group of
   enzymes. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types,
   which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA
   substrate at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage
   sites are separate from one another. To cut DNA, all restriction
   enzymes make two incisions, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone
   (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.
   These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and provide a defense
   mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a prokaryote, the
   restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called
   restriction digestion; meanwhile, host DNA is protected by a
   modification enzyme (a methyltransferase) that modifies the prokaryotic
   DNA and blocks cleavage. Together, these two processes form the
   restriction modification system.
   Over 3,000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail, and more
   than 800 of these are available commercially. These enzymes are
   routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories, and they are a
   vital tool in molecular cloning.
