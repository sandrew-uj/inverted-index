   In enzymology, a phosphoamidase (EC 3.9.1.1) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          N-phosphocreatine + H[2]O
           creatine + phosphate
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-phosphocreatine and
   H[2]O, whereas its two products are creatine and phosphate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on phosphorus-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme
   class is phosphamide hydrolase. This enzyme is also called creatine
   phosphatase.
