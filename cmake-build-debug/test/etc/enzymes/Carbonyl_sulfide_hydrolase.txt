   Carbonyl sulfide hydrolase (EC 3.13.1.7; abbreviated as COSase) is an
   enzyme that degrades carbonyl sulfide (COS) to hydrogen sulfide (H[2]S)
   and carbon dioxide (CO[2]). Isolated from Thiobacillus thioparus
   bacterium, the potential of COSase would reduce the high global warming
   effect of COS and change the ozone chemistry, because COS is the source
   of sulfur in the troposphere.
