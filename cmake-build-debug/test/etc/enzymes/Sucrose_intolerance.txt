   Sucrose intolerance or genetic sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (GSID) is
   the condition in which sucrase-isomaltase, an enzyme needed for proper
   metabolism of sucrose (sugar) and starch (e.g., grains), is not
   produced or the enzyme produced is either partially functional or
   non-functional in the small intestine. All GSID patients lack fully
   functional sucrase, while the isomaltase activity can vary from minimal
   functionality to almost normal activity. The presence of residual
   isomaltase activity may explain why some GSID patients are better able
   to tolerate starch in their diet than others with GSID.
