   Mammals (from Latin mamma, 'breast') are a group of vertebrate animals
   constituting the class Mammalia (/m@|meIli@/), and characterized by the
   presence of mammary glands which in females produce milk for feeding
   (nursing) their young, a neocortex (a region of the brain), fur or
   hair, and three middle ear bones. These characteristics distinguish
   them from reptiles and birds, from which they diverged in the
   Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago. Around 6,400 extant species
   of mammals have been described. The largest orders are the rodents,
   bats and Eulipotyphla (hedgehogs, moles, shrews, and others). The next
   three are the Primates (including humans, apes, monkeys, and others),
   the Artiodactyla (cetaceans and even-toed ungulates), and the Carnivora
   (cats, dogs, seals, and others).
   In terms of cladistics, which reflects evolutionary history, mammals
   are the only living members of the Synapsida; this clade, together with
   Sauropsida (reptiles and birds), constitutes the larger Amniota clade.
   The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a
   group that included the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At the end of the
   Carboniferous period around 300 million years ago, this group diverged
   from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The
   line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split into several diverse
   groups of non-mammalian synapsids--sometimes incorrectly referred to as
   mammal-like reptiles--before giving rise to Therapsida in the Early
   Permian period. Mammals originated from cynodonts, an advanced group of
   therapsids, during the Late Triassic. The modern mammalian orders arose
   in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the
   extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been the dominant
   terrestrial animal group from 66 million years ago to the present.
   The basic body type is quadruped, and most mammals use their four
   extremities for terrestrial locomotion; but in some, the extremities
   are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground, or on
   two legs. Mammals range in size from the 30-40 mm (1.2-1.6 in)
   bumblebee bat to the 30 m (98 ft) blue whale--possibly the largest
   animal to have ever lived. Maximum lifespan varies from two years for
   the shrew to 211 years for the bowhead whale. All modern mammals give
   birth to live young, except the five species of monotremes, which are
   egg-laying mammals. The most species-rich group of mammals, the cohort
   called placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the
   fetus during gestation.
   Most mammals are intelligent, with some possessing large brains,
   self-awareness, and tool use. Mammals can communicate and vocalize in
   several ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking,
   alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. Mammals can organize
   themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies--but
   can also be solitary and territorial. Most mammals are polygynous, but
   some can be monogamous or polyandrous.
   Domestication of many types of mammals by humans played a major role in
   the Neolithic revolution, and resulted in farming replacing hunting and
   gathering as the primary source of food for humans. This led to a major
   restructuring of human societies from nomadic to sedentary, with more
   co-operation among larger and larger groups, and ultimately the
   development of the first civilizations. Domesticated mammals provided,
   and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well
   as food (meat and dairy products), fur, and leather. Mammals are also
   hunted and raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science.
   Mammals have been depicted in art since Paleolithic times, and appear
   in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Decline in numbers and
   extinction of many mammals is primarily driven by human poaching and
   habitat destruction, primarily deforestation.
