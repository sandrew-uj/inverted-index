   In enzymology, an alkenylglycerophosphoethanolamine hydrolase (EC
   3.3.2.5) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + H[2]O
           an aldehyde +
          sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are
   1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and H[2]O, whereas its
   two products are aldehyde and sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this
   enzyme class is 1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
   aldehydohydrolase. This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism.
