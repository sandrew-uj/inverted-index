   Dihydrofolate reductase, or DHFR, is an enzyme that reduces
   dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, using NADPH as electron
   donor, which can be converted to the kinds of tetrahydrofolate
   cofactors used in 1-carbon transfer chemistry. In humans, the DHFR
   enzyme is encoded by the DHFR gene. It is found in the q11->q22
   region of chromosome 5. Bacterial species possess distinct DHFR
   enzymes (based on their pattern of binding diaminoheterocyclic
   molecules), but mammalian DHFRs are highly similar.
