   Topoisomerases (or DNA topoisomerases) are enzymes that participate in
   the overwinding or underwinding of DNA. The winding problem of DNA
   arises due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure.
   During DNA replication and transcription, DNA becomes overwound ahead
   of a replication fork. If left unabated, this torsion would eventually
   stop the ability of DNA or RNA polymerases involved in these processes
   to continue down the DNA strand.
   In order to prevent and correct these types of topological problems
   caused by the double helix, topoisomerases bind to DNA and cut the
   phosphate backbone of either one or both the DNA strands. This
   intermediate break allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound, and, at
   the end of these processes, the DNA backbone is resealed again. Since
   the overall chemical composition and connectivity of the DNA do not
   change, the DNA substrate and product are chemical isomers, differing
   only in their global topology, resulting in the name for these enzymes.
   Topoisomerases are isomerase enzymes that act on the topology of
   DNA.
   Bacterial topoisomerases and human topoisomerases proceed via similar
   mechanisms for managing DNA supercoils. Topoisomerases can be further
   classified into subfamilies. In the type I family, there are two
   subfamilies; type IA and type IB when the enzyme links to the 5'
   phosphate of the DNA strand, and the 3' phosphate on the DNA,
   respectively. In the type II family, the structure and organism
   determine the subfamilies and their functions.
