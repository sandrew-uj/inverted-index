   FK506-binding protein 10 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the
   FKBP10 gene.
   The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the FKBP-type
   peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase family. It is located in
   endoplasmic reticulum and acts as molecular chaperones. Two
   alternatively spliced variants, which encode different isoform, are
   reported.
