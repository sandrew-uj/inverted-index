   (2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl)acetyl-CoA synthase (EC
   6.2.1.38, 2-oxo-Delta3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetyl-CoA
   synthetase) is an enzyme with systematic name
   ((1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl)acetate:CoA ligase
   (AMP-forming). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical
   reaction
          [(1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl]acetate + ATP + CoA
           AMP + diphosphate +
          [(1R)-2,2,3-trimethyl-5-oxocyclopent-3-enyl]acetyl-CoA
   This enzyme is isolated from Pseudomonas putida.
