   Enoyl-CoA-(Delta) isomerase, also known as dodecenoyl-CoA-(Delta)
   isomerase, 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase,
   Delta3(cis),Delta2(trans)-enoyl-CoA isomerase, or acetylene-allene
   isomerase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cis- or
   trans-double bonds of coenzyme A (CoA) bound fatty acids at
   gamma-carbon (position 3) to trans double bonds at beta-carbon
   (position 2) as below:

   This enzyme has an important role in the metabolism of unsaturated
   fatty acids in beta oxidation.
