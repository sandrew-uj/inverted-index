   Nitric oxide dioxygenase (EC 1.14.12.17) is an enzyme that catalyzes
   the conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrate (NO^-
   [3]) . The net reaction for the reaction catalyzed by nitric oxide
   dioxygenase is shown below:
     * 2NO + 2O[2] + NAD(P)H -> 2NO[3]^- + NAD(P)^+ + H^+
   Nitric oxide is a ubiquitous small molecule that is integrated in a
   wide variety of physiological processes including smooth muscle
   vasodilation, platelet disaggregation, neurotransmission, and immune
   response to bacterial infection. Overproduction of this
   signaling molecule can be lethal to cells by poisoning cellular energy
   production. The most sensitive targets of NO are aconitase, an enzyme
   that catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate in the citric
   acid cycle, and cytochrome oxidase, the last enzyme in the respiratory
   electron transport chain of mitochondria. Additionally NO, with its
   lone radical on the nitrogen atom, is implicated in a number of
   secondary mechanisms of toxicity, including catalase inhibition
   (resulting in hydrogen peroxide toxicity), Fe-S center iron liberation,
   and the formation of dinitosyl-iron complexes.
   Due to the potential lethality of NO, cells benefitted greatly from the
   evolution of an enzyme capable of catalyzing the conversion of toxic NO
   to nitrate. A 'nitric oxide dioxygenase' is an enzyme that is capable
   of carrying out this reaction. NO dioxygenase belongs to the family of
   oxidoreductases, more specifically those acting on paired donors, with
   O[2] as oxidant and with incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the
   other donor.
