   Nicotinate dehydrogenase (cytochrome) (EC 1.17.2.1, nicotinic acid
   hydroxylase, nicotinate hydroxylase) is an enzyme with systematic name
   nicotinate:cytochrome 6-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating). This
   enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

                   nicotinate + a ferricytochrome + H[2]O
      6-hydroxynicotinate + a ferrocytochrome + 2 H^+
   This smelly two-component enzyme from Pseudomonas belongs to the family
   of xanthine dehydrogenases.
