   Factor VII (EC 3.4.21.21, formerly known as proconvertin) is one of the
   proteins that causes blood to clot in the coagulation cascade. It is an
   enzyme of the serine protease class. Once bound to tissue factor
   released from damaged tissues, it is converted to factor VIIa (or
   blood-coagulation factor VIIa, activated blood coagulation factor VII),
   which in turn activates factor IX and factor X.
   A recombinant form of human factor VIIa (eptacog alfa [activated],
   NovoSeven) has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for
   uncontrolled bleeding in hemophilia patients. It is sometimes used
   unlicensed in severe uncontrollable bleeding, although there have been
   safety concerns. A biosimilar form of recombinant activated factor VII
   (AryoSeven) is also available, but does not play any considerable role
   in the market.
