   b-galactosidase, also called lactase, beta-gal or b-gal, is a family of
   glycoside hydrolase enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of
   b-galactosides into monosaccharides through the breaking of a
   glycosidic bond. b-galactosides include carbohydrates containing
   galactose where the glycosidic bond lies above the galactose molecule.
   Substrates of different b-galactosidases include ganglioside GM1,
   lactosylceramides, lactose, and various glycoproteins.
