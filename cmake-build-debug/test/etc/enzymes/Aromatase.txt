   Aromatase, also called estrogen synthetase or estrogen synthase, is an
   enzyme responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of estrogens. It
   is CYP19A1, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (EC 1.14.14.1),
   which are monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in
   steroidogenesis. In particular, aromatase is responsible for the
   aromatization of androgens into estrogens. The enzyme aromatase can be
   found in many tissues including gonads (granulosa cells), brain,
   adipose tissue, placenta, blood vessels, skin, and bone, as well as in
   tissue of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, breast cancer, and
   endometrial cancer.^[citation needed] It is an important factor in
   sexual development.
