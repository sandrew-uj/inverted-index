   Cytochrome c peroxidase, or CCP, is a water-soluble heme-containing
   enzyme of the peroxidase family that takes reducing equivalents from
   cytochrome c and reduces hydrogen peroxide to water:
          CCP + H[2]O[2] + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2H^+ -> CCP + 2H[2]O + 2
          ferricytochrome c
   CCP can be derived from aerobically grown yeast strains and can be
   isolated in both native and recombinant forms with high yield from
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzyme's primary function is to eliminate
   toxic radical molecules produced by the cell which are harmful to
   biological systems. It works to maintain low concentration levels of
   hydrogen peroxide, which is generated by the organism naturally through
   incomplete oxygen reduction. When glucose levels in fast growing yeast
   strains are exhausted, the cells turn to respiration which raises the
   concentration of mitochondrial H[2]O[2.] In addition to its
   peroxidase activity, it acts as a sensor and a signaling molecule to
   exogenous H[2]O[2], which activates mitochondrial catalase
   activity. In eukaryotes, CCP contain a mono-b-type haem cofactor
   and is targeted to the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. In
   prokaryotes, CCP contains a c-type dihaem cofactor and is localized to
   the periplasm of the cell. Both enzymes work to resist peroxide-induced
   cellular stress.
   CCP plays an integral role in enabling inter-protein biological
   electron transfer. The negative charge transfer process is carried out
   by a complex formed between cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase
   which occurs in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria. The mechanism
   involves ferrous cytochrome c (Cc) providing electrons for the Cc-CcP
   system to reduce hydrogen peroxide to water. The complex is formed
   by non-covalent interactions.
   Cytochrome c peroxidase can react with hydroperoxides other than
   hydrogen peroxide, but the reaction rate is much slower than with
   hydrogen peroxide.
   It was first isolated from baker's yeast by R. A. Altschul, Abrams, and
   Hogness in 1940, though not to purity. The first purified
   preparation of yeast CCP dates to Takashi Yonetani and his preparation
   by ion exchange chromatography in the early 1960s. The X-ray structure
   was the work of Thomas Poulos and coworkers in the late 1970s. CCP
   is the first heme enzyme to have its structure successfully solved
   through X-ray crystallography.
   The yeast enzyme is a monomer of molecular weight 34,000, containing
   293 amino acids, and contains as well a single non-covalently bound
   heme b. It is negatively charged and is a moderately-sized enzyme (34.2
   kDa). The apoenzyme, not active and bound to substrates, has an acidic
   isolelectric point of pH 5.0-5.2. Unusual for proteins, this enzyme
   crystallizes when dialysed against distilled water. More so, the enzyme
   purifies as a consequence of crystallization, making cycles of
   crystallization an effective final purification step.
   Much like catalase, the reaction of cytochrome c peroxidase proceeds
   through a three-step process, forming first a Compound I and then a
   Compound II intermediate:
          CCP + ROOH -> Compound I + ROH + H[2]O
          CCP-compound I + e^- + H^+ -> Compound II
          Compound II + e^- + H^+ -> CCP
   CCP-catalyzed redox cycle
   CCP in the resting state has a ferric heme, and, after the addition of
   two oxidizing equivalents from a hydroperoxide (usually hydrogen
   peroxide), it becomes oxidised to a formal oxidation state of +5 (Fe^V,
   commonly referred to as ferryl heme. However, both low-temperature
   magnetic susceptibility measurements and Moessbauer spectroscopy show
   that the iron in Compound I of CCP is a +4 ferryl iron, with the second
   oxidising equivalent existing as a long-lived free-radical on the
   side-chain of the tryptophan residue (Trp-191). In its resting
   state, the Fe atom (Fe (III)) in the CCP heme is paramagnetic with high
   spin (S= 5/2). Once the catalytic cycle is initiated, the iron atom is
   oxidized to form an oxyferryl intermediate (Fe(IV)=O) has low spin (S=
   1/2). This is different from most peroxidases, which have the
   second oxidising equivalent on the porphyrin instead. Compound I of CCP
   is fairly long-lived, decaying to CCP-compound II with a half-life at
   room temperature of 40 minutes to a couple hours.
   CCP has high sequence identity to the closely related ascorbate
   peroxidase enzyme.
