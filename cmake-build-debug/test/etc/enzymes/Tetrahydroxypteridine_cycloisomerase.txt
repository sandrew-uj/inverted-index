   In enzymology, a tetrahydroxypteridine cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.3) is
   an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          tetrahydroxypteridine
           xanthine-8-carboxylate
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, tetrahydroxypteridine, and one
   product, xanthine-8-carboxylate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class
   of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   tetrahydroxypteridine lyase (isomerizing). It employs one cofactor,
   NAD+.
