   Cytochrome P450 2E1 (abbreviated CYP2E1, EC 1.14.13.n7) is a member of
   the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system, which is involved in
   the metabolism of xenobiotics in the body. This class of enzymes is
   divided up into a number of subcategories, including CYP1, CYP2, and
   CYP3, which as a group are largely responsible for the breakdown of
   foreign compounds in mammals.
   While CYP2E1 itself carries out a relatively low number of these
   reactions (~4% of known P450-mediated drug oxidations), it and related
   enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the breakdown of many
   toxic environmental chemicals and carcinogens that enter the body, in
   addition to basic metabolic reactions such as fatty acid
   oxidations.
