   In enzymology, a vitamin-K-epoxide reductase (warfarin-insensitive) (EC
   1.17.4.5) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          3-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phytyl-2,3-dihydronaphthoquinone + oxidized
          dithiothreitol
          
          2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone +
          1,4-dithiothreitol
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are
   3-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phytyl-2,3-dihydronaphthoquinone and oxidized
   dithiothreitol, whereas its two products are
   2,3-epoxy-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone and
   1,4-dithiothreitol.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically
   those acting on the CH or CH2 groups of donor with a disulfide as
   acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   3-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phytyl-2,3-dihydronaphthoquinone:oxidized-dithi
   othreitol oxidoreductase.
