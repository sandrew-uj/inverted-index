   Transketolase encoded by the TKT gene is an enzyme of both the pentose
   phosphate pathway in all organisms and the Calvin cycle of
   photosynthesis. It catalyzes two important reactions, which operate in
   opposite directions in these two pathways. In the first reaction of the
   non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine
   diphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon ketose
   (D-xylulose-5-P), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon aldose
   (D-ribose-5-P) to form a 7-carbon ketose (sedoheptulose-7-P). The
   abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon
   aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle, transketolase catalyzes
   the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and
   glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the ketose
   D-xylulose-5-P.
   The second reaction catalyzed by transketolase in the pentose phosphate
   pathway involves the same thiamine diphosphate-mediated transfer of a
   2-carbon fragment from D-xylulose-5-P to the aldose
   erythrose-4-phosphate, affording fructose 6-phosphate and
   glyceraldehyde-3-P. Again, in the Calvin cycle exactly the same
   reaction occurs, but in the opposite direction. Moreover, in the Calvin
   cycle this is the first reaction catalyzed by transketolase, rather
   than the second.
   In mammals, transketolase connects the pentose phosphate pathway to
   glycolysis, feeding excess sugar phosphates into the main carbohydrate
   metabolic pathways. Its presence is necessary for the production of
   NADPH, especially in tissues actively engaged in biosyntheses, such as
   fatty acid synthesis by the liver and mammary glands, and for steroid
   synthesis by the liver and adrenal glands. Thiamine diphosphate is an
   essential cofactor, along with calcium.
   Transketolase is abundantly expressed in the mammalian cornea by the
   stromal keratocytes and epithelial cells and is reputed to be one of
   the corneal crystallins.
