   RecQ helicase is a family of helicase enzymes initially found in
   Escherichia coli that has been shown to be important in genome
   maintenance. They function through catalyzing the reaction
   ATP + H[2]O -> ADP + P and thus driving the unwinding of paired DNA and
   translocating in the 3' to 5' direction. These enzymes can also drive
   the reaction NTP + H[2]O -> NDP + P to drive the unwinding of either
   DNA or RNA.
