   A nuclease (also archaically known as nucleodepolymerase or
   polynucleotidase) is an enzyme capable of cleaving the phosphodiester
   bonds between nucleotides of nucleic acids. Nucleases variously affect
   single and double stranded breaks in their target molecules. In living
   organisms, they are essential machinery for many aspects of DNA repair.
   Defects in certain nucleases can cause genetic instability or
   immunodeficiency. Nucleases are also extensively used in molecular
   cloning.
   There are two primary classifications based on the locus of activity.
   Exonucleases digest nucleic acids from the ends. Endonucleases act on
   regions in the middle of target molecules. They are further
   subcategorized as deoxyribonucleases and ribonucleases. The former acts
   on DNA, the latter on RNA.
