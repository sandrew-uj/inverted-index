   In enzymology, a maleate isomerase (EC 5.2.1.1), or maleate cis-tran
   isomerase, is a member of the Asp/Glu racemase superfamily discovered
   in bacteria. It is responsible for catalyzing cis-trans isomerization
   of the C2-C3 double bond in maleate to produce fumarate, which is a
   critical intermediate in citric acid cycle. The presence of an
   exogenous mercaptan is required for catalysis to happen.

   Maleate isomerase participates in butanoate metabolism and nicotinate
   and nicotinamide metabolism. It is an essential enzyme for the last
   step of metabolic degradation pathway of nicotinic acid. Recently,
   maleate isomerase has been an industrial target for degradation of
   tobacco waste. It is also got attention for its involvement in
   aspartic acid and maleic acid production.
   Maleate isomerase has been utilized by multiple bacteria species,
   including Pseudomonas fluorescens, Alcaligenes faecalis,
   Bacillus stearothermophilus, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas
   putida and Nocardia farcinica. The enzyme has a molecular
   weight of 74,000 and a turnover number of 1,800 moles per mole of
   protein per min.
