   Nitrilase enzymes (nitrile aminohydrolase; EC 3.5.5.1) catalyse the
   hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids and ammonia, without the
   formation of "free" amide intermediates. Nitrilases are involved in
   natural product biosynthesis and post translational modifications in
   plants, animals, fungi and certain prokaryotes. Nitrilases can also be
   used as catalysts in preparative organic chemistry. Among others,
   nitrilases have been used for the resolution of racemic mixtures.
   Nitrilase should not be confused with nitrile hydratase (nitrile
   hydro-lyase; EC 4.2.1.84) which hydrolyses nitriles to amides. Nitrile
   hydratases are almost invariably co-expressed with an amidase, which
   converts the amide to the carboxylic acid. Consequently, it can
   sometimes be difficult to distinguish nitrilase activity from nitrile
   hydratase plus amidase activity.
