   A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes (increases the rate of) proteolysis, the breakdown of
   proteins into smaller polypeptides or single amino acids. They do this
   by cleaving the peptide bonds within proteins by hydrolysis, a reaction
   where water breaks bonds. Proteases are involved in many biological
   functions, including digestion of ingested proteins, protein catabolism
   (breakdown of old proteins), and cell signaling.
   Without additional helping mechanisms, (such as an enzyme or other
   catalyst, to catalyze [i.e., "speed up"] a reaction), proteolysis would
   be very slow, taking hundreds of years. Proteases can be found in
   all forms of life and viruses. They have independently evolved multiple
   times, and different classes of protease can perform (or "enable") (or
   "speed up") the same reaction by completely different catalytic
   mechanisms.
