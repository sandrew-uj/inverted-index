   Thiazole synthase (EC 2.8.1.10, thiG (gene)) is an enzyme with
   systematic name 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate:thiol
   sulfurtransferase. This enzyme catalyses the
   following chemical reaction
          1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate + 2-iminoacetate +
          thiocarboxy-adenylate-[sulfur-carrier protein ThiS]
          
          2-[(2R,5Z)-2-carboxy-4-methylthiazol-5(2H)-ylidene]ethyl
          phosphate + [sulfur-carrier protein ThiS] + 2 H[2]O
   H[2]S can provide the sulfur in vitro.
