   Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) is an enzyme that alternately
   catalyzes the dismutation (or partitioning) of the superoxide (O^-
   [2]) radical into ordinary molecular oxygen (O[2]) and hydrogen
   peroxide (H^
   [2]O^
   [2]). Superoxide is produced as a by-product of oxygen metabolism and,
   if not regulated, causes many types of cell damage. Hydrogen
   peroxide is also damaging and is degraded by other enzymes such as
   catalase. Thus, SOD is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all
   living cells exposed to oxygen. One exception is Lactobacillus
   plantarum and related lactobacilli, which use a different mechanism to
   prevent damage from reactive O^-
   [2].
