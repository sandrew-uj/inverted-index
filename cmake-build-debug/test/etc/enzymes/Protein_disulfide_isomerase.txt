   Protein disulfide isomerase, or PDI, is an enzyme in the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes and the periplasm of bacteria that
   catalyzes the formation and breakage of disulfide bonds between
   cysteine residues within proteins as they fold. This allows
   proteins to quickly find the correct arrangement of disulfide bonds in
   their fully folded state, and therefore the enzyme acts to catalyze
   protein folding.
