   In enzymology, a homoserine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.3) is an enzyme
   that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          L-homoserine + NAD(P)^+
           L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde + NAD(P)H + H^+
   The 2 substrates of this enzyme are L-homoserine and NAD^+ (or NADP^+),
   whereas its 3 products are L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde, NADH (or NADPH),
   and H^+.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically
   those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD^+ or NADP^+ as
   acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   L-homoserine:NAD(P)^+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include
   HSDH, and HSD.
   Homoserine dehydrogenase catalyses the third step in the aspartate
   pathway; the NAD(P)-dependent reduction of aspartate beta-semialdehyde
   into homoserine. Homoserine is an intermediate in the
   biosynthesis of threonine, isoleucine, and methionine.
