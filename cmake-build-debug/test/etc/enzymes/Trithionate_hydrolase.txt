   In enzymology, a trithionate hydrolase (EC 3.12.1.1) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          trithionate + H[2]O
           thiosulfate + sulfate + 2 H^+
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trithionate and H[2]O,
   whereas its 3 products are thiosulfate, sulfate, and H^+.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on sulfur-sulfur bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class
   is trithionate thiosulfohydrolase. This enzyme participates in sulfur
   metabolism.
