   Serine proteases (or serine endopeptidases) are enzymes that cleave
   peptide bonds in proteins, in which serine serves as the nucleophilic
   amino acid at the (enzyme's) active site. They are found
   ubiquitously in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Serine proteases fall
   into two broad categories based on their structure: chymotrypsin-like
   (trypsin-like) or subtilisin-like.
