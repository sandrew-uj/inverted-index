   FK506 binding protein 6, also known as FKBP6, is a human gene. The
   encoded protein shows structural homology to FKBP immunophilins, which
   bind to the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin.
   FKBP6 is essential for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis during
   spermatogenesis. Targeted inactivation of FKBP6 in mice results in
   infertile males, but apparently normal females. Rats with spermatogenic
   failure at meiosis were found to have a deletion in the exon 8 portion
   of the FKBP6 gene. Mutations in this gene have been associated with
   male infertility in humans.
   FKBP6 is deleted in Williams syndrome, however this hemizygous loss of
   FKBP6 is not associated with infertility.
   FKBP6 contains 3 a-helices and 11 b-sheet strands, and as a
   FK506-family protein, has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressant
   which can assist in the prevention of allograft rejections.
