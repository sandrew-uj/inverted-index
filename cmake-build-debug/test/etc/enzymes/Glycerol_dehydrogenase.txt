   Glycerol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.6, also known as NAD^+-linked glycerol
   dehydrogenase, glycerol: NAD^+ 2-oxidoreductase, GDH, GlDH, GlyDH) is
   an enzyme in the oxidoreductase family that utilizes the NAD^+ to
   catalyze the oxidation of glycerol to form glycerone
   (dihydroxyacetone).
   Overall reaction of glycerol to glycerone with NAD+ as catalyzed by
   glycerol dehydrogenase
   This enzyme is an oxidoreductase, specifically a metal-dependent
   alcohol dehydrogenase that plays a role in anaerobic glycerol
   metabolism and has been isolated from a number of bacteria, including
   Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella aerogenes, Streptococcus
   faecalis, Erwinia aeroidea, Bacillus megaterium, and
   Bacillus stearothermophilus. However, most studies of glycerol
   dehydrogenase have been performed in Bacillus stearothermophilus, (B.
   stearothermophilus) due to its thermostability and the following
   structural and functional information will, therefore, refer primarily
   to the characterization of the enzyme in this bacterium.
