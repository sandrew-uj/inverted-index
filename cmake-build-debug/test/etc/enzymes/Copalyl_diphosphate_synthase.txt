   In enzymology, a copalyl diphosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.12) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          geranylgeranyl diphosphate
           (+)-copalyl diphosphate
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and
   one product, (+)-copalyl diphosphate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class
   of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   (+)-copalyl-diphosphate lyase (decyclizing). This enzyme participates
   in diterpenoid biosynthesis.
