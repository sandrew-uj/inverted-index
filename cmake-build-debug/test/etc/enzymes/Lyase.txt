   In biochemistry, a lyase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breaking (an
   "elimination" reaction) of various chemical bonds by means other than
   hydrolysis (a "substitution" reaction) and oxidation, often forming a
   new double bond or a new ring structure. The reverse reaction is also
   possible (called a "Michael addition"). For example, an enzyme that
   catalyzed this reaction would be a lyase:
          ATP -> cAMP + PP[i]
   Lyases differ from other enzymes in that they require only one
   substrate for the reaction in one direction, but two substrates for the
   reverse reaction.
