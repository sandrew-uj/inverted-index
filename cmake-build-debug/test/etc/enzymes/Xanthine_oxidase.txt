   Xanthine oxidase (XO, sometimes 'XAO') is a form of xanthine
   oxidoreductase, a type of enzyme that generates reactive oxygen
   species. These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of hypoxanthine to
   xanthine and can further catalyze the oxidation of xanthine to uric
   acid. These enzymes play an important role in the catabolism of purines
   in some species, including humans.
   Xanthine oxidase is defined as an enzyme activity (EC 1.17.3.2).
   The same protein, which in humans has the HGNC approved gene symbol
   XDH, can also have xanthine dehydrogenase activity (EC 1.17.1.4).
   Most of the protein in the liver exists in a form with xanthine
   dehydrogenase activity, but it can be converted to xanthine oxidase by
   reversible sulfhydryl oxidation or by irreversible proteolytic
   modification.
