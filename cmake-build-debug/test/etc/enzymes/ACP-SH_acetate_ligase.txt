   ACP-SH:acetate ligase (EC 6.2.1.35, HS-acyl-carrier protein:acetate
   ligase, [acyl-carrier protein]:acetate ligase, MadH) is an enzyme with
   systematic name acetate:(acyl-carrier-protein) ligase
   (AMP-forming). This enzyme catalyses the following
   chemical reaction
          ATP + acetate + an [acyl-carrier protein]
           AMP + diphosphate + an acetyl-[acyl-carrier
          protein]
   This enzyme, from the anaerobic bacterium Malonomonas rubra, is a
   component of the multienzyme complex EC 4.1.1.89, biotin-dependent
   malonate decarboxylase.
