   Rhodanese, also known as rhodanase, thiosulfate sulfurtransferase,
   thiosulfate cyanide transsulfurase, and thiosulfate
   thiotransferase, is a mitochondrial enzyme that detoxifies cyanide
   (CN^-) by converting it to thiocyanate (SCN^-).
   This reaction takes place in two steps. The diagram on the right shows
   the crystallographically-determined structure of rhodanese. In the
   first step, thiosulfate is reduced by the thiol group on cysteine-247
   1, to form a persulfide and a sulfite 2. In the second step, the
   persulfide reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate, re-generating
   the cysteine thiol 1.

   This reaction is important for the treatment of exposure to cyanide,
   since the thiocyanate formed is around 1 / 200 as toxic.^:p. 15938
   The use of thiosulfate solution as an antidote for cyanide poisoning is
   based on the activation of this enzymatic cycle.
   Rhodanese shares evolutionary relationship with a large family of
   proteins, including
     * Cdc25 phosphatase catalytic domain.
     * non-catalytic domains of eukaryotic dual-specificity
       MAPK-phosphatases
     * non-catalytic domains of yeast PTP-type MAPK-phosphatases
     * non-catalytic domains of yeast Ubp4, Ubp5, Ubp7
     * non-catalytic domains of mammalian Ubp-Y
     * Drosophila heat shock protein HSP-67BB
     * several bacterial cold-shock and phage shock proteins
     * plant senescence associated proteins
     * catalytic and non-catalytic domains of rhodanese
   Rhodanese has an internal duplication. This domain is found as a single
   copy in other proteins, including phosphatases and ubiquitin C-terminal
   hydrolases.
