   Lycopene beta-cyclase (EC 5.5.1.19, CrtL, CrtL-b, CrtY) is an enzyme
   with systematic name carotenoid beta-end group lyase
   (decyclizing). This enzyme catalyses the
   following chemical reaction
          carotenoid psi-end group
           carotenoid beta-end group
   This enzyme requires NAD(P)H. It converts Lycopene (2 psi ends) into
   Beta-Carotene (2 beta ends).
