   Adenylyl cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1, also commonly known as adenyl cyclase and
   adenylate cyclase, abbreviated AC) is an enzyme with key regulatory
   roles in essentially all cells. It is the most polyphyletic known
   enzyme: six distinct classes have been described, all catalyzing the
   same reaction but representing unrelated gene families with no known
   sequence or structural homology. The best known class of adenylyl
   cyclases is class III or AC-III (Roman numerals are used for classes).
   AC-III occurs widely in eukaryotes and has important roles in many
   human tissues.
   All classes of adenylyl cyclase catalyse the conversion of adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) to 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) and pyrophosphate.
   Magnesium ions are generally required and appear to be closely involved
   in the enzymatic mechanism. The cAMP produced by AC then serves as a
   regulatory signal via specific cAMP-binding proteins, either
   transcription factors, enzymes (e.g., cAMP-dependent kinases), or ion
   transporters.
   Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to 3',5'-cyclic AMP.
