   In enzymology, a phytanate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.24) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          ATP + phytanate + CoA
           AMP + diphosphate + phytanoyl-CoA
   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, phytanate, and CoA, whereas
   its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and phytanoyl-CoA.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those
   forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name
   of this enzyme class is phytanate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme
   is also called phytanoyl-CoA ligase.
