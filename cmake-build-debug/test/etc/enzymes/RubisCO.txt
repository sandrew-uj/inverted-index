   Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, commonly known by the
   abbreviations RuBisCo, rubisco, RuBPCase, or RuBPco, is an enzyme
   involved in the first major step of carbon fixation, a process by which
   atmospheric carbon dioxide is converted by plants and other
   photosynthetic organisms to energy-rich molecules such as glucose. In
   chemical terms, it catalyzes the carboxylation of
   ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (also known as RuBP). It is probably the most
   abundant enzyme on Earth.
