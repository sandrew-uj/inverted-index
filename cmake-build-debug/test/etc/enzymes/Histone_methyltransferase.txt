   Histone methyltransferases (HMT) are histone-modifying enzymes (e.g.,
   histone-lysine N-methyltransferases and histone-arginine
   N-methyltransferases), that catalyze the transfer of one, two, or three
   methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. The
   attachment of methyl groups occurs predominantly at specific lysine or
   arginine residues on histones H3 and H4. Two major types of histone
   methyltranferases exist, lysine-specific (which can be SET (Su(var)3-9,
   Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax) domain containing or non-SET domain
   containing) and arginine-specific. In both types of histone
   methyltransferases, S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) serves as a cofactor
   and methyl donor group.
   The genomic DNA of eukaryotes associates with histones to form
   chromatin. The level of chromatin compaction depends heavily on
   histone methylation and other post-translational modifications of
   histones. Histone methylation is a principal epigenetic
   modification of chromatin that determines gene expression, genomic
   stability, stem cell maturation, cell lineage development, genetic
   imprinting, DNA methylation, and cell mitosis.
