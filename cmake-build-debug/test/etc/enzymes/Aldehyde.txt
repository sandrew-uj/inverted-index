   Chemically, an aldehyde /|aeldIhaId/ is a compound containing a
   functional group with the structure -CHO, consisting of a carbonyl
   center (a carbon double-bonded to oxygen) with the carbon atom also
   bonded to hydrogen and to any generic alkyl or side chain R group.
   The functional group itself (i.e. without the "R" side chain) is known
   as an aldehyde or formyl group.
   Aldehydes, which are generally created by removing a hydrogen from an
   alcohol, are common in organic chemistry; the most well-known is
   formaldehyde. As they are frequently strongly scented, many fragrances
   are or contain aldehydes.
