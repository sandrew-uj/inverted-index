   Types of peroxides, from top to bottom: peroxide ion, organic peroxide,
   organic hydroperoxide, peracid. The peroxide group is marked in blue.
   R, R^1 and R^2 mark hydrocarbon moieties.
   Peroxides are a group of compounds with the structure R-O-O-R, where R
   = any element. The O-O group in a peroxide is called the
   peroxide group or peroxo group. The nomenclature is somewhat
   variable.
   The most common peroxide is hydrogen peroxide (H[2]O[2]), colloquially
   known simply as "peroxide". It is marketed as solutions in water at
   various concentrations. Many organic peroxides are known as well.
   O-O bond length = 147.4 pm O-H bond length = 95.0 pm
   Structure and dimensions of H[2]O[2].
   Aside from hydrogen peroxide, some other major classes of peroxides
   are:
     * Peroxy acids, the peroxy derivatives of many familiar acids,
       examples being peroxymonosulfuric acid and peracetic acid, and
       their salts, one example of which is potassium peroxydisulfate.
     * Main group peroxides, compounds with the linkage E-O-O-E (E = main
       group element).
     * Metal peroxides, examples being barium peroxide (BaO[2]), sodium
       peroxide (Na[2]O[2]) and zinc peroxide (ZnO[2]).
     * Organic peroxides, compounds with the linkage C-O-O-C or C-O-O-H.
       One example is tert-butylhydroperoxide.
