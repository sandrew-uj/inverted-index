   Monoamine oxidases (MAO) (EC 1.4.3.4) are a family of enzymes that
   catalyze the oxidation of monoamines, employing oxygen to clip off
   their amine group. They are found bound to the outer membrane
   of mitochondria in most cell types of the body. The first such enzyme
   was discovered in 1928 by Mary Bernheim in the liver and was named
   tyramine oxidase. The MAOs belong to the protein family of
   flavin-containing amine oxidoreductases.
   MAOs are important in the breakdown of monoamines ingested in food, and
   also serve to inactivate monoamine neurotransmitters. Because of the
   latter, they are involved in a number of psychiatric and neurological
   diseases, some of which can be treated with monoamine oxidase
   inhibitors (MAOIs) which block the action of MAOs.
