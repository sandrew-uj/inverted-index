   Chitinases (chitodextrinase, 1,4-beta-poly-N-acetylglucosaminidase,
   poly-beta-glucosaminidase, beta-1,4-poly-N-acetyl glucosamidinase,
   poly[1,4-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide)] glycanohydrolase,
   (1->4)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucan glycanohydrolase) are
   hydrolytic enzymes that break down glycosidic bonds in chitin.
   As chitin is a component of the cell walls of fungi and exoskeletal
   elements of some animals (including mollusks and arthropods),
   chitinases are generally found in organisms that either need to reshape
   their own chitin or dissolve and digest the chitin of fungi or
   animals.
