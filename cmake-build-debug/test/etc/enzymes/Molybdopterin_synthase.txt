   Molybdopterin synthase (EC 2.8.1.12, MPT synthase) is an enzyme
   required to synthesize molybdopterin (MPT) from precursor Z (now known
   as cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate). Molydopterin is
   subsequently complexed with molybdenum to form molybdenum cofactor
   (MoCo). MPT synthase catalyses the following chemical reaction:
          precursor Z + 2 [molybdopterin-synthase sulfur-carrier
          protein]-Gly-NH-CH[2]-C(O)SH + H[2]O
           molybdopterin + 2 molybdopterin-synthase
          sulfur-carrier protein
   Molybdopterin synthase is heterodimeric and coded for by the MOCS2
   gene. Genetic deficiencies of enzymes such as MPT synthase, which
   are involved in MoCo biosynthesis, lead to MoCo deficiency, a rare
   disease that results in severe neurological
   abnormalities.
