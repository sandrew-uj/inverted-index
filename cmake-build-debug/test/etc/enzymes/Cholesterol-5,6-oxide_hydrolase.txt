   Cholesterol-5,6-oxide hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.11, cholesterol-epoxide
   hydrolase, ChEH) is an enzyme with systematic name
   5,6alpha-epoxy-5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol hydrolase.
   This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction
          (1) 5,6alpha-epoxy-5alpha-cholestan-3beta-ol + H[2]O
           5alpha-cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol
          (2) 5,6beta-epoxy-5beta-cholestan-3beta-ol + H[2]O
           5alpha-cholestane-3beta,5alpha,6beta-triol
   The enzyme works equally well with either epoxide as substrate on rat
   liver microsomes. The ChEH is an intracellular en membranous enzyme
   localized mainly on the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. Its molecular
   characterization revealed it is composed of two proteinaceous
   sub-units: the 3beta-hydroxysteroid delta8-delta7-isomerase (D8D7I),
   also known as the emopamyl binding protein (EBP), which is the
   catalytic subunit, and the 3beta-hydroxysteroid delta7 reductase
   (DHCR7), which is the regulatory subunit. The ChEH is the "so
   called" microsomal antiestrogen binding site (AEBS), a secondary target
   of the antitumor drug tamoxifen and related compounds. The ChEH is
   inhibited by different pharmacological classes of drugs including
   anticancer drugs such as tamoxifen and natural substances such as ring
   B-oxysterols and poly-unsaturated fatty acids.
