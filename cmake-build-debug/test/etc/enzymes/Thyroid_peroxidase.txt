   Thyroid peroxidase, also called thyroperoxidase (TPO) or iodide
   peroxidase, is an enzyme expressed mainly in the thyroid where it is
   secreted into colloid. Thyroid peroxidase oxidizes iodide ions to form
   iodine atoms for addition onto tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin for
   the production of thyroxine (T[4]) or triiodothyronine (T[3]), the
   thyroid hormones. In humans, thyroperoxidase is encoded by the TPO
   gene.
