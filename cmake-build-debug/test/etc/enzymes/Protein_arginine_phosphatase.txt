   Protein Arginine Phosphatase (PAPs), also known as Phosphoarginine
   Phosphatase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of
   phosphoarginine residues in proteins. Protein phosphatases (PPs)
   are "obligatory heteromers" made up of two maximum catalytic
   subunits attached to a non-catalytic subunit. Arginine modification is
   a post-translational protein modification in gram-positive bacteria.
   McsB and YwIE were recently identified as phosphorylating enzymes in
   Bacillus Subtilis (B.Subtilis). YwIE was thought to be a
   protein-tyrosine-phosphatase, and McsB a tyrosine-kinase, however
   in 2012 Elsholz et al. showed that McsB is a
   protein-arginine-kinase (PAK) and YwlE is a
   phosphatase-arginine-phosphatase (PAP).
   Many proteins rely on protein phosphatase activity for regulating their
   stability, localization, and interaction with other proteins.
   Arginine modification is a post-translational protein modification in
   gram-positive bacteria, and protein arginine phosphorylation regulates
   transcription factors, in addition to tagging rogue proteins for
   degradation in gram-positive bacteria. Like phosphorylation,
   dephosphorylation is a reversible post-translational event. It is
   reversible through the action of kinases (enzymes that adds a phosphate
   group to a protein via phosphorylation), and this antagonist activity
   of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins controls all
   aspect of prokaryotic and eukaryotic life. In general, protein
   phosphatases play a crucial role in cell signaling regulation in both
   eukaryotes and prokaryotes. They act by removing a phosphate group from
   proteins, and their activity counteracts that of protein kinases.
