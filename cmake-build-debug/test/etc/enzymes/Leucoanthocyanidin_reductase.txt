   In enzymology, a leucoanthocyanidin reductase (EC 1.17.1.3) (LAR, aka
   leucocyanidin reductase or LCR) is an enzyme that catalyzes the
   chemical reaction
          (2R,3S)-catechin + NADP^+ + H[2]O
           2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin + NADPH + H^+
   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (2R,3S)-catechin, NADP^+, and
   H[2]O, whereas its 3 products are 2,3-trans-3,4-cis-leucocyanidin,
   NADPH, and H^+.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically
   those acting on CH or CH[2] groups with NAD^+ or NADP^+ as acceptor.
   The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2R,3S)-catechin:NADP^+
   4-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called leucocyanidin reductase.
   This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis.
   The enzyme can be found in the plant Hedysarum sulphurescens and in
   Vitis vinifera (grape).
