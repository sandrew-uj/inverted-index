   UbiX is a flavin prenyltransferase, catalysing the addition of
   dimethylallyl-monophosphate (DMAP) (or dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate
   (DMAPP) ) onto the N5 and C6 positions of FMN culminating in the
   formation of the prenylated FMN (prFMN) cofactor. The enzyme is
   involved in the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway in E.coli from where it
   gets its name. UbiX is associated with the UbiD enzymes as prFMN is
   utilised by UbiD enzymes in their function as reversible
   decarboxylases. Unusually for a prenyltransferase UbiX is not metal
   dependent.
   Following the elucidation of prFMN's structure in the active site of
   Fdc1 from aspergillus niger (AnFdc1) the prenyltrasferase activity of
   UbiX was investigated. Incubation of UbiX from P.aeruginosa with
   oxidised FMN and DMAP followed by reduction with sodium dithionite lead
   to the formation of prFMN^reduced. The same procedure followed by
   re-oxidation under aerobic conditions lead to prFMN^radical. Anaerobic
   incubation of apo-AnFdc1 with prFMN^reduced followed by exposure to
   oxygen lead to decarboxylase activity, however incubation with
   prFMN^radical did not afford activity to apo-AnFdc1. This suggests that
   the prFMN^reduced form can be correctly oxidised by UbiD/Fdc1 to the
   corresponding prFMN^iminium (Figure 2).
