   Lysozyme, also known as muramidase or N-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase,
   is an antimicrobial enzyme produced by animals that forms part of the
   innate immune system. Lysozyme is a glycoside hydrolase that catalyzes
   the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and
   N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in peptidoglycan, which is the major
   component of gram-positive bacterial cell wall. This hydrolysis in
   turn compromises the integrity of bacterial cell walls causing lysis of
   the bacteria.
   Lysozyme is abundant in secretions including tears, saliva, human milk,
   and mucus. It is also present in cytoplasmic granules of the
   macrophages and the polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Large amounts
   of lysozyme can be found in egg white. C-type lysozymes are closely
   related to alpha-lactalbumin in sequence and structure, making them
   part of the same glycoside hydrolase family 22. In humans, the
   C-type lysozyme enzyme is encoded by the LYZ gene.
   Hen egg white lysozyme is thermally stable, with a melting point
   reaching up to 72 DEGC at pH 5.0. However, lysozyme in human milk
   loses activity very quickly at that temperature. Hen egg white
   lysozyme maintains its activity in a large range of pH (6-9). Its
   isoelectric point is 11.35. The isoelectric point of human milk
   lysozyme is 10.5-11.
