   In enzymology, a benzoate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.25) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          ATP + benzoate + CoA
           AMP + diphosphate + benzoyl-CoA
   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, benzoate, and CoA, whereas its
   3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and benzoyl-CoA.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those
   forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name
   of this enzyme class is benzoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names
   in common use include benzoate-coenzyme A ligase, benzoyl-coenzyme A
   synthetase, and benzoyl CoA synthetase (AMP forming). This enzyme
   participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
