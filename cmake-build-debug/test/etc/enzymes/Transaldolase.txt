   Transaldolase is an enzyme (EC 2.2.1.2) of the non-oxidative phase of
   the pentose phosphate pathway. In humans, transaldolase is encoded by
   the TALDO1 gene.
   The following chemical reaction is catalyzed by transaldolase:
          sedoheptulose 7-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
           erythrose 4-phosphate + fructose 6-phosphate
