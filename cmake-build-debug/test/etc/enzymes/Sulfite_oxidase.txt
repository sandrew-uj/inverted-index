   Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) is an enzyme in the mitochondria of all
   eukaryotes, with exception of the yeasts.^[citation needed] It oxidizes
   sulfite to sulfate and, via cytochrome c, transfers the electrons
   produced to the electron transport chain, allowing generation of ATP in
   oxidative phosphorylation. This is the last step in the
   metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds and the sulfate is excreted.
   Sulfite oxidase is a metallo-enzyme that utilizes a molybdopterin
   cofactor and a heme group (in a case of animals). It is one of the
   cytochromes b[5] and belongs to the enzyme super-family of molybdenum
   oxotransferases that also includes DMSO reductase, xanthine oxidase,
   and nitrite reductase.
   In mammals, the expression levels of sulfite oxidase is high in the
   liver, kidney, and heart, and very low in spleen, brain, skeletal
   muscle, and blood.
