   Maltase (EC 3.2.1.20, alpha-glucosidase, glucoinvertase,
   glucosidosucrase, maltase-glucoamylase, alpha-glucopyranosidase,
   glucosidoinvertase, alpha-D-glucosidase, alpha-glucoside hydrolase,
   alpha-1,4-glucosidase, alpha-D-glucoside glucohydrolase) is one type of
   alpha-glucosidase enzymes located in the brush border of the small
   intestine. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of disaccharide
   maltose into two simple sugars of glucose. Maltase is found in plants,
   bacteria, yeast, humans, and other vertebrates. It is thought to be
   synthesized by cells of the mucous membrane lining the intestinal
   wall.
   Digestion of starch requires six intestinal enzymes. Two of these
   enzymes are luminal endo-glucosidases named alpha-amylases. The other
   four enzymes have been identified as different maltases,
   exo-glucosidases bound to the luminal surface of enterocytes. Two of
   these maltase activities were associated with sucrase-isomaltase
   (maltase Ib, maltase Ia). The other two maltases with no distinguishing
   characteristics were named maltase-glucoamylase (maltases II and III).
   The activities of these four maltases are also described as
   alpha-glucosidase because they all digest linear starch
   oligosaccharides to glucose.
   In most cases, it is equivalent to alpha-glucosidase, but the term
   "maltase" emphasizes the disaccharide nature of the substrate from
   which glucose is cleaved, and "alpha-glucosidase" emphasizes the bond,
   whether the substrate is a disaccharide or polysaccharide.^[citation

   Vampire bats are the only vertebrates known to not exhibit intestinal
   maltase activity.
