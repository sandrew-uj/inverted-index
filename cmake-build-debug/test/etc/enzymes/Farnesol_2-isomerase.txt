   In enzymology, a farnesol 2-isomerase (EC 5.2.1.9) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          2-trans,6-trans-farnesol
           2-cis,6-trans-farnesol
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2-trans,6-trans-farnesol, and one
   product, 2-cis,6-trans-farnesol.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans
   isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   2-trans,6-trans-farnesol 2-cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme is also
   called farnesol isomerase.
