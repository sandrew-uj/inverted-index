   Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) (EC 1.14.16.1) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the hydroxylation of the aromatic side-chain of phenylalanine
   to generate tyrosine. PAH is one of three members of the
   biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, a class of
   monooxygenase that uses tetrahydrobiopterin (BH[4], a pteridine
   cofactor) and a non-heme iron for catalysis. During the reaction,
   molecular oxygen is heterolytically cleaved with sequential
   incorporation of one oxygen atom into BH[4] and phenylalanine
   substrate.  In humans, mutations in its encoding gene, PAH, can
   lead to the metabolic disorder phenylketonuria.
