   cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 is an enzyme (EC 3.1.4.17) from
   the phosphodiesterase class. It is found in various tissues, most
   prominently the corpus cavernosum and the retina. It has also been
   recently discovered to play a vital role in the cardiovascular system.
   The phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes, found in several tissues
   including the rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina, belong to
   a large family of cyclic nucleotide PDEs that catalyze cAMP and cGMP
   hydrolysis.
   The interest in PDEs as molecular targets of drug action has grown with
   the development of isozyme-selective PDE inhibitors that offer potent
   inhibition of selected isozymes without the side-effects attributed to
   nonselective inhibitors such as theophylline.
   Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil are PDE5 inhibitors
   that are significantly more potent and selective than zaprinast and
   other early PDE5 inhibitors.
