   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1) (AdoHcyase) is an
   enzyme of the activated methyl cycle, responsible for the reversible
   hydration of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine into adenosine and homocysteine.
   AdoHcyase is a ubiquitous enzyme which binds and requires NAD^+ as a
   cofactor. AdoHcyase is a highly conserved protein of about 430 to
   470 amino acids. The family contains a glycine-rich region in the
   central part of AdoHcyase; a region thought to be involved in
   NAD-binding.
   AdoHcyase is significantly associated with adenosine deaminase
   deficiency, which classically manifests in severe combine
   immunodeficiency (SCID). Accumulated adenosine derivatives, dATPs,
   irreversibly bind to and inhibit AdoHcyase, promoting the buildup of
   S-adenosyl-L-homocystine (due to equilibrium constant favors
   S-adenosyl-L-homocystine), a potent inhibitor of methyl transfer
   reactions.
   This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.
