   Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper oxidases found in plants, fungi,
   and bacteria. Laccases oxidize a variety of phenolic substrates,
   performing one-electron oxidations, leading to crosslinking. For
   example, laccases play a role in the formation of lignin by promoting
   the oxidative coupling of monolignols, a family of naturally occurring
   phenols. Other laccases, such as those produced by the fungus
   Pleurotus ostreatus, play a role in the degradation of lignin, and can
   therefore be classed as lignin-modifying enzymes. Other laccases
   produced by fungi can facilitate the biosynthesis of melanin pigments.
    Laccases catalyze ring cleavage of aromatic compounds.
   Laccase was first studied by Hikorokuro Yoshida in 1883 and then by
   Gabriel Bertrand in 1894 in the sap of the Japanese lacquer
   tree, where it helps to form lacquer, hence the name laccase.
