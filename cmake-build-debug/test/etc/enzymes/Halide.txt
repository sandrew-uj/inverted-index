   A halide is a binary phase, of which one part is a halogen atom and the
   other part is an element or radical that is less electronegative (or
   more electropositive) than the halogen, to make a, e.g., fluoride,
   chloride, or theoretically tennesside compound. The alkali metals
   combine directly with halogens under appropriate conditions forming
   halides of the general formula, MX (X = F, Cl, Br or I). Many salts are
   halides; the hal- syllable in halide and halite reflects this
   correlation. All Group 1 metals form halides that are white solids at
   room temperature.
   A halide ion is a halogen atom bearing a negative charge. The halide
   anions are fluoride (F-
   ), chloride (Cl-
   ), bromide (Br-
   ), iodide (I-
   ) and astatide (At-
   ). Such ions are present in all ionic halide salts. Halide minerals
   contain halides.
   All these halides are colourless, high melting crystalline solids
   having high negative enthalpies of formation.
