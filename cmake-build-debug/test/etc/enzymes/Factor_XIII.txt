   Factor XIII or fibrin stabilizing factor is a zymogen found from the
   blood of humans and some other animals. It is activated by thrombin to
   factor XIIIa. XIIIa is an enzyme of the blood coagulation system that
   crosslinks fibrin. Deficiency of XIII worsens clot stability and
   increases bleeding tendency.
   Human XIII is a heterotetramer. It consist of 2 enzymatic A peptides
   and 2 non-enzymatic B peptides. XIIIa is a dimer of activated A
   peptides.
