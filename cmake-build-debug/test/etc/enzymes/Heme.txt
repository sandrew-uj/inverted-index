   Heme, or haem (spelling differences) is a substance precursive to
   hemoglobin, which is necessary to bind oxygen in the bloodstream. Heme
   is biosynthesized in both the bone marrow and the liver.
   In microbiological terms, heme is coordination complex "consisting of
   an iron ion coordinated to a porphyrin acting as a tetradentate ligand,
   and to one or two axial ligands." The definition is loose, and many
   depictions omit the axial ligands. Among the metalloporphyrins
   deployed by metalloproteins as prosthetic groups, heme is one of the
   most widely used and defines a family of proteins known as
   hemoproteins. Hemes are most commonly recognized as components of
   hemoglobin, the red pigment in blood, but are also found in a number of
   other biologically important hemoproteins such as myoglobin,
   cytochromes, catalases, heme peroxidase, and endothelial nitric oxide
   synthase.
   The word haem is derived from Greek ama haima meaning "blood".
