   In enzymology, SEPHCHC synthase (EC EC 2.2.1.9), encoded by menD gene
   in E. coli, is an enzyme that catalyzes the second step of menaquinone
   (vitamin K2) biosynthesis. The two substrates of this enzyme are
   2-oxoglutarate and isochorismate. The products of this enzyme are
   5-enolpyruvoyl-6-hydroxy-2-succinyl-cyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylate and
   CO[2]. It belongs to the transferase family.
