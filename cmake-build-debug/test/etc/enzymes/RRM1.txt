   Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit is an enzyme that in
   humans is encoded by the RRM1 gene.
   This gene encodes one of two non-identical subunits which constitute
   ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase, an enzyme essential for the
   production of deoxyribonucleotides prior to DNA synthesis in S phase of
   dividing cells. It is one of several genes located in the imprinted
   gene domain of 11p15.5, an important tumor-suppressor gene region.
   Alterations in this region have been associated with the
   Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma,
   adrenocortical carcinoma, and lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. This
   gene may play a role in malignancies and disease that involve this
   region. This gene is oriented in a head-to-tail configuration with the
   stromal interaction molecule 1 gene (STIM1), with the 3' end of STIM1
   situated 1.6 kb from the 5' end of this gene.
