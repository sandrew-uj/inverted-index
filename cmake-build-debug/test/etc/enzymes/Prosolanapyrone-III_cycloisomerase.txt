   Prosolanapyrone-III cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.20, Sol5, SPS,
   solanapyrone synthase (bifunctional enzyme: prosolanapyrone II
   oxidase/prosolanapyrone III cyclosiomerase)) is an enzyme with
   systematic name prosolanapyrone-III:(-)-solanapyrone A
   isomerase. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical
   reaction
          prosolanapyrone III
           (-)-solanapyrone A
   The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin
   solanapyrone in some fungi.
