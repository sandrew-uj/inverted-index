   Dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase (DHBP oxidase) is an enzyme. In the
   IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature, dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase is EC
   1.5.3.12.
   Dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase produces oxidized forms of
   benzophenanthridine alkaloids:
     * In Sanguinaria canadensis (bloodroot), dihydrobenzophenanthridine
       oxidase produces sanguinarine from dihydrosanguinarine, and
       chelirubine from dihydrochelirubine.
     * In Eschscholzia californica (California poppy),
       dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase produces macarpine from
       dihydromacarpine.
