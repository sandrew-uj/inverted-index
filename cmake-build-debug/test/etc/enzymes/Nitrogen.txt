   Nitrogen is the chemical element with the symbol N and atomic number 7.
   It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel
   Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish
   had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is
   generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The
   name nitrogene was suggested by French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude
   Chaptal in 1790 when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric
   acid and nitrates. Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote,
   from the Ancient Greek: azwtiko'*s "no life", as it is an asphyxiant
   gas; this name is used instead in many languages, such as French,
   Italian, Russian, Romanian, Portuguese and Turkish, and appears in the
   English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and
   azo compounds.
   Nitrogen is the lightest member of group 15 of the periodic table,
   often called the pnictogens. It is a common element in the universe,
   estimated at about seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the
   Solar System. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the
   element bind to form dinitrogen, a colourless and odorless diatomic gas
   with the formula N[2]. Dinitrogen forms about 78% of Earth's
   atmosphere, making it the most abundant uncombined element. Nitrogen
   occurs in all organisms, primarily in amino acids (and thus proteins),
   in the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and in the energy transfer molecule
   adenosine triphosphate. The human body contains about 3% nitrogen by
   mass, the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen,
   carbon, and hydrogen. The nitrogen cycle describes movement of the
   element from the air, into the biosphere and organic compounds, then
   back into the atmosphere.
   Many industrially important compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid,
   organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain
   nitrogen. The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen
   (N=3N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon
   monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty
   for both organisms and industry in converting N[2] into useful
   compounds, but at the same time means that burning, exploding, or
   decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large
   amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and
   nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are
   key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.
   Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy-stores, nitrogen is a
   constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in
   high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a
   constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including
   antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural
   nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates
   nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing
   into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the
   natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on
   receptors of animal neurotransmitters.
