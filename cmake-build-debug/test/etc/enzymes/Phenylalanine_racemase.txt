   The enzyme phenylalanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.11, phenylalanine racemase,
   phenylalanine racemase (adenosine triphosphate-hydrolysing), gramicidin
   S synthetase I) is the enzyme that acts on amino acids and derivatives.
   It activates both the L & D stereo isomers of phenylalanine to form
   L-phenylalanyl adenylate and D-phenylalanyl adenylate, which are bound
   to the enzyme. These bound compounds are then transferred to the thiol
   group of the enzyme followed by conversion of its configuration, the
   D-isomer being the more favorable configuration of the two, with a 7 to
   3 ratio between the two isomers. The racemisation reaction of
   phenylalanine is coupled with the highly favorable hydrolysis of
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and
   pyrophosphate (PP), thermodynamically allowing it to proceed. This
   reaction is then drawn forward by further hydrolyzing PP to inorganic
   phosphate (P[i]), via Le Chatelier's principle.
