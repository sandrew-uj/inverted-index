   Catechol oxidase is a copper oxidase that contains a type 3 di-copper
   cofactor and catalyzes the oxidation of ortho-diphenols into
   ortho-quinones coupled with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water.
   It is present in a variety of species of plants and fungi including
   Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) and Camellia sinensis (Indian tea
   leaf). Metalloenzymes with type 3 copper centers are characterized
   by their ability to reversibly bind dioxygen at ambient conditions.
   In plants, catechol oxidase plays a key role in enzymatic browning by
   catalyzing the oxidation of catechol to o-quinone in the presence of
   oxygen, which can rapidly polymerize to form the melanin that grants
   damaged fruits their dark brown coloration.
