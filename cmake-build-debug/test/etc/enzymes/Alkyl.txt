   In organic chemistry, an alkyl substituent is an alkane missing one
   hydrogen. The term alkyl is intentionally unspecific to include
   many possible substitutions. An acyclic alkyl has the general formula
   of C[n]H[2n+1]. A cycloalkyl is derived from a cycloalkane by removal
   of a hydrogen atom from a ring and has the general formula
   C[n]H[2n-1]. Typically an alkyl is a part of a larger molecule. In
   structural formula, the symbol R is used to designate a generic
   (unspecified) alkyl group. The smallest alkyl group is methyl, with the
   formula CH[3]-.
