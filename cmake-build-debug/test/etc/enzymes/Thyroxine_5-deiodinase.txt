   Thyroxine 5-deiodinase also known as type III iodothyronine deiodinase
   (EC number 1.21.99.3) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the
   DIO3 gene. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical
   reaction
          3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine + iodide + A + H^+
           L-thyroxine + AH[2]
   The protein encoded by this intronless gene belongs to the
   iodothyronine deiodinase family. It catalyzes the inactivation of
   thyroid hormone by inner ring deiodination of the prohormone thyroxine
   (T[4]) and the bioactive hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T[3]) to
   inactive metabolites, 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (RT[3]) and
   3,3'-diiodothyronine (T[2]), respectively. This enzyme is highly
   expressed in the pregnant uterus, placenta, fetal and neonatal tissues,
   suggesting that it plays an essential role in the regulation of thyroid
   hormone inactivation during embryological development.
