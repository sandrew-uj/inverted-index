   The glucose oxidase enzyme (GOx or GOD) also known as notatin (EC
   number 1.1.3.4) is an oxidoreductase that catalyses the oxidation of
   glucose to hydrogen peroxide and D-glucono-d-lactone. This enzyme is
   produced by certain species of fungi and insects and displays
   antibacterial activity when oxygen and glucose are present.
   Reaction catalyzed by glucose oxidase
   Glucose oxidase is widely used for the determination of free glucose in
   body fluids (medical testing), in vegetal raw material, and in the food
   industry. It also has many applications in biotechnologies, typically
   enzyme assays for biochemistry including biosensors in
   nanotechnologies. It was first isolated by Detlev Mueller in
   1928 from Aspergillus niger.
