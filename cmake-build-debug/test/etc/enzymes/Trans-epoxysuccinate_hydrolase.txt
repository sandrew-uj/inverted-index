   In enzymology, a trans-epoxysuccinate hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.4) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate + H[2]O
           meso-tartrate
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate
   and H[2]O, whereas its product is meso-tartrate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this
   enzyme class is trans-2,3-epoxysuccinate hydrolase. Other names in
   common use include trans-epoxysuccinate hydratase, and tartrate
   epoxydase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
   metabolism.
