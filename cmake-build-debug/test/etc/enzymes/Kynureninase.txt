   Kynureninase or L-Kynurenine hydrolase (KYNU) (EC 3.7.1.3) is a PLP
   dependent enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of kynurenine (Kyn) into
   anthranilic acid (Ant). It can also act on 3hKyn (to produce 3hAnt) and
   some other (3-arylcarbonyl)-alanines. Humans express one kynureninase
   enzyme that is encoded by the KYNU gene located on chromosome
   2.
   KYNU is part of the pathway for the catabolism of Trp and the
   biosynthesis of NAD cofactors from tryptophan (Trp).
   Kynureninase catalyzes the following reaction:
     * L-kynurenine + H[2]O = anthranilate + L-alanine
