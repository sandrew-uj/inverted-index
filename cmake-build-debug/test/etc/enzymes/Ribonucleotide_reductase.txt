   Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), also known as ribonucleotide
   diphosphate reductase (rNDP), is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation
   of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. It catalyzes this
   formation by removing the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring of
   nucleoside diphosphates. This reduction produces
   deoxyribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides in turn are used in the
   synthesis of DNA. The reaction catalyzed by RNR is strictly conserved
   in all living organisms. Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in
   regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is
   maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair.
   A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a
   reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action.
   The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (deoxythymidine
   diphosphate) is synthesized by another enzyme (thymidylate kinase) from
   dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate).
