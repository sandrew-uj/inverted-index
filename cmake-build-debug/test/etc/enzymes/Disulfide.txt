   In chemistry, a disulfide refers to a functional group with the
   structure R-S-S-R'. The linkage is also called an SS-bond or sometimes
   a disulfide bridge and is usually derived by the coupling of two thiol
   groups. In biology, disulfide bridges formed between thiol groups in
   two cysteine residues are an important component of the secondary and
   tertiary structure of proteins. Persulfide usually refers to R-S-S-H
   compounds.
   In inorganic chemistry disulfide usually refers to the corresponding
   anion S^2-
   [2] (^-S-S^-).
