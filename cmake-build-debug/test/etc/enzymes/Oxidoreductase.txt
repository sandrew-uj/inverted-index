   In biochemistry, an oxidoreductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the
   transfer of electrons from one molecule, the reductant, also called the
   electron donor, to another, the oxidant, also called the electron
   acceptor. This group of enzymes usually utilizes NADP+ or NAD+ as
   cofactors. Transmembrane oxidoreductases create electron
   transport chains in bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria, including
   respiratory complexes I, II and III. Some others can associate with
   biological membranes as peripheral membrane proteins or be anchored to
   the membranes through a single transmembrane helix.
