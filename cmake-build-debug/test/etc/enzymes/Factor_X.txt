   Factor X, also known by the eponym Stuart-Prower factor, is an enzyme
   (EC 3.4.21.6) of the coagulation cascade. It is a serine endopeptidase
   (protease group S1, PA clan). Factor X is synthesized in the liver and
   requires vitamin K for its synthesis.
   Factor X is activated, by hydrolysis, into factor Xa by both factor IX
   (with its cofactor, factor VIII in a complex known as intrinsic Tenase)
   and factor VII with its cofactor, tissue factor (a complex known as
   extrinsic Tenase ). It is therefore the first member of the final
   common pathway or thrombin pathway.
   It acts by cleaving prothrombin in two places (an arg-thr and then an
   arg-ile bond), which yields the active thrombin. This process is
   optimized when factor Xa is complexed with activated co-factor V in the
   prothrombinase complex.
   Factor Xa is inactivated by protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor
   (ZPI), a serine protease inhibitor (serpin). The affinity of this
   protein for factor Xa is increased 1000-fold by the presence of protein
   Z, while it does not require protein Z for inactivation of factor XI.
   Defects in protein Z lead to increased factor Xa activity and a
   propensity for thrombosis.
   The half life of factor X is 40-45 hours.
