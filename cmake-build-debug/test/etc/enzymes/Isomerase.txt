   Isomerases are a general class of enzymes that convert a molecule from
   one isomer to another. Isomerases facilitate intramolecular
   rearrangements in which bonds are broken and formed. The general form
   of such a reaction is as follows:
   A-B -> B-A
   There is only one substrate yielding one product. This product has the
   same molecular formula as the substrate but differs in bond
   connectivity or spatial arrangement. Isomerases catalyze reactions
   across many biological processes, such as in glycolysis and
   carbohydrate metabolism.
