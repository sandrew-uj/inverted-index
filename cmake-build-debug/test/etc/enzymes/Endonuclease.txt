   Endonucleases are enzymes that cleave the phosphodiester bond within a
   polynucleotide chain. Some, such as deoxyribonuclease I, cut DNA
   relatively nonspecifically (without regard to sequence), while many,
   typically called restriction endonucleases or restriction enzymes,
   cleave only at very specific nucleotide sequences. Endonucleases differ
   from exonucleases, which cleave the ends of recognition sequences
   instead of the middle (endo) portion. Some enzymes known as
   "exo-endonucleases", however, are not limited to either nuclease
   function, displaying qualities that are both endo- and exo-like.
   Evidence suggests that endonuclease activity experiences a lag compared
   to exonuclease activity.
   Restriction enzymes are endonucleases from eubacteria and archaea that
   recognize a specific DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence
   recognized for cleavage by a restriction enzyme is called the
   restriction site. Typically, a restriction site will be a palindromic
   sequence about four to six nucleotides long. Most restriction
   endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary
   single-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization
   and are termed "sticky ends". Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of
   the fragments can be joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of
   restriction endonucleases known, each attacking a different restriction
   site. The DNA fragments cleaved by the same endonuclease can be joined
   together regardless of the origin of the DNA. Such DNA is called
   recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new
   combinations. Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are
   divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and Type III, according
   to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used in genetic
   engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial,
   plant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology. One of the
   more famous endonucleases is Cas9.
