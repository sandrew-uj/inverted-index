   In enzymology, an oxalate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.8) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          ATP + oxalate + CoA
           AMP + diphosphate + oxalyl-CoA
   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, oxalate, and coenzyme A (CoA),
   whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and oxalyl-CoA.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those
   forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name
   of this enzyme class is oxalate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names
   in common use include oxalyl-CoA synthetase, and oxalyl coenzyme A
   synthetase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
   metabolism.
   Organisms with Oxalate-CoA Ligases include:
   Arabidopsis thaliana
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae
