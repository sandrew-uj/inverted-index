   A peptide bond is an amide type of covalent chemical bond linking two
   consecutive alpha-amino acids from C1 (carbon number one) of one
   alpha-amino acid and N2 (nitrogen number two) of another, along a
   peptide or protein chain.
   It can also be called an eupeptide bond to separate it from an
   isopeptide bond, a different type of amide bond between two amino
   acids.
