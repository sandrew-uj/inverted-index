   Aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALA synthase, ALAS, or
   delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase) is an enzyme (EC 2.3.1.37) that
   catalyzes the synthesis of d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) the first common
   precursor in the biosynthesis of all tetrapyrroles such as hemes,
   cobalamins and chlorophylls. The reaction is as follows:
          succinyl-CoA + glycine
           d-aminolevulinic acid + CoA + CO[2]
   This enzyme is expressed in all non-plant eukaryotes and the a-class of
   proteobacteria and the reaction it catalyses is sometimes referred to
   as the Shemin pathway for ALA formation. Other organisms produce
   ALA through a three enzyme pathway known as the C5 pathway. ALA is
   synthesized through the condensation of glycine and succinyl-CoA. In
   humans, transcription of ALA synthase is tightly controlled by the
   presence of Fe^2+-binding elements, to prevent accumulation of
   porphyrin intermediates in the absence of iron. There are two forms of
   ALA synthase in the body. One form is expressed in red blood cell
   precursor cells (ALAS2), whereas the other (ALAS1) is ubiquitously
   expressed throughout the body. The red blood cell form is coded by a
   gene on chromosome x, whereas the other form is coded by a gene on
   chromosome 3.
   The disease X-linked sideroblastic anemia is caused by mutations in the
   ALA synthase gene on chromosome X, whereas no diseases are known to be
   caused by mutations in the other gene. Gain of function mutations in
   the erythroid specific ALA synthase gene have been shown recently to
   cause a previously unknown form of porphyria known as X-linked-dominant
   protoporphyria.
