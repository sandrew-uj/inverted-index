   Nitrogenase (flavodoxin) (EC 1.19.6.1) is an enzyme with systematic
   name reduced flavodoxin:dinitrogen oxidoreductase
   (ATP-hydrolysing). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical
   reaction
          6 reduced flavodoxin + 6 H^+ + N[2] + n ATP
           6 oxidized flavodoxin + 2 NH[3] + n ADP + n
          phosphate
   The enzyme is a complex of two proteins containing iron-sulfur centres
   and molybdenum.
