   Guanylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2, also known as guanyl cyclase, guanylyl
   cyclase, or GC) is a lyase enzyme that converts guanosine triphosphate
   (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and pyrophosphate.
   It is often part of the G protein signaling cascade that is activated
   by low intracellular calcium levels and inhibited by high intracellular
   calcium levels. In response to calcium levels, guanylate cyclase
   synthesizes cGMP from GTP. cGMP keeps cGMP-gated channels open,
   allowing for the entry of calcium into the cell.
   Like cAMP, cGMP is an important second messenger that internalizes the
   message carried by intercellular messengers such as peptide hormones
   and nitric oxide and can also function as an autocrine signal.
   Depending on cell type, it can drive adaptive/developmental changes
   requiring protein synthesis. In smooth muscle, cGMP is the signal for
   relaxation, and is coupled to many homeostatic mechanisms including
   regulation of vasodilation, vocal tone, insulin secretion, and
   peristalsis. Once formed, cGMP can be degraded by phosphodiesterases,
   which themselves are under different forms of regulation, depending on
   the tissue.
