   In enzymology, a butyrate kinase (EC 2.7.2.7) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          ADP + butyryl-phosphate
           ATP + butyrate
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and butyryl-phosphate,
   whereas its two products are ATP and butyrate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those
   transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a
   carboxy group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   ATP:butanoate 1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in
   butyrate metabolism.
   This enzyme is transcribed from the gene buk, which is part of
   the ASHKA super family.
