   Luciferase is a generic term for the class of oxidative enzymes that
   produce bioluminescence, and is usually distinguished from a
   photoprotein. The name was first used by Raphael Dubois who invented
   the words luciferin and luciferase, for the substrate and enzyme,
   respectively. Both words are derived from the Latin word lucifer,
   meaning "lightbearer", which in turn is derived from the Latin words
   for "light" (lux) and "to bring or carry" (ferre).

   Luciferases are widely used in biotechnology, for microscopy and as
   reporter genes, for many of the same applications as fluorescent
   proteins. However, unlike fluorescent proteins, luciferases do not
   require an external light source, but do require addition of luciferin,
   the consumable substrate.
