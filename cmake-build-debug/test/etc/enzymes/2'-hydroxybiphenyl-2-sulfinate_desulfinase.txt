   In enzymology, a 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate desulfinase (EC
   3.13.1.3) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate + H[2]O
           2-hydroxybiphenyl + sulfite
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are
   2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate and H[2]O, whereas its two products are
   2-hydroxybiphenyl and sulfite.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on carbon-sulfur bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class
   is 2'-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinate sulfohydrolase. Other names in common
   use include gene dszB-encoded hydrolase, 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)
   benzenesulfinate:H[2]O hydrolase, DszB, HBPSi desulfinase,
   2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) benzenesulfinate sulfohydrolase, HPBS desulfinase,
   2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzenesulfinate hydrolase,
   2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzenesulfinate desulfinase, and
   2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzenesulfinate desulfinase.
