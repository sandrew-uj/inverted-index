   Prolycopene isomerase (EC 5.2.1.13, CRTISO, carotene cis-trans
   isomerase, ZEBRA2 (gene), carotene isomerase, carotenoid isomerase) is
   an enzyme with systematic name 7,9,7',9'-tetracis-lycopene
   cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme catalyses the
   following chemical reaction
          7,9,7',9'-tetracis-lycopene
           all-trans-lycopene
   This enzyme is involved in carotenoid biosynthesis.
