   In biochemistry, a phosphatase is an enzyme that uses water to cleave a
   phosphoric acid monoester into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Because
   a phosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of its substrate, it is a
   subcategory of hydrolases. Phosphatase enzymes are essential to
   many biological functions, because phosphorylation (e.g. by protein
   kinases) and dephosphorylation (by phosphatases) serve diverse roles in
   cellular regulation and signaling. Whereas phosphatases remove
   phosphate groups from molecules, kinases catalyze the transfer of
   phosphate groups to molecules from ATP. Together, kinases and
   phosphatases direct a form of post-translational modification that is
   essential to the cell's regulatory network.
   Phosphatase enzymes are not to be confused with phosphorylase enzymes,
   which catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from hydrogen
   phosphate to an acceptor. Due to their prevalence in cellular
   regulation, phosphatases are an area of interest for pharmaceutical
   research.
