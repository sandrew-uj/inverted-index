   Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a peroxidase enzyme that in humans is encoded
   by the MPO gene on chromosome 17. MPO is most abundantly expressed
   in neutrophil granulocytes (a subtype of white blood cells), and
   produces hypohalous acids to carry out their antimicrobial activity,
   including hypochlorous acid, the sodium salt of which is the chemical
   in bleach. It is a lysosomal protein stored in azurophilic
   granules of the neutrophil and released into the extracellular space
   during degranulation. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase has a heme
   pigment, which causes its green color in secretions rich in
   neutrophils, such as mucus and sputum. The green color contributed
   to its outdated name verdoperoxidase.
