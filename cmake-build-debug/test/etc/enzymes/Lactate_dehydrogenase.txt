   Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH or LD) is an enzyme found in nearly all
   living cells. LDH catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate and
   back, as it converts NAD^+ to NADH and back. A dehydrogenase is an
   enzyme that transfers a hydride from one molecule to another.
   LDH exists in four distinct enzyme classes. This article is
   specifically about the NAD(P)-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase. Other
   LDHs act on D-lactate and/or are dependent on cytochrome c: D-lactate
   dehydrogenase (cytochrome) and L-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome).
   LDH is expressed extensively in body tissues, such as blood cells and
   heart muscle. Because it is released during tissue damage, it is a
   marker of common injuries and disease such as heart failure.
