   Transglutaminases are enzymes that in nature primarily catalyze the
   formation of an isopeptide bond between g-carboxamide groups
   ( -(C=O)NH[2] ) of glutamine residue side chains and the e-amino groups
   ( -NH[2] ) of lysine residue side chains with subsequent release of
   ammonia ( NH[3] ). Lysine and glutamine residues must be bound to a
   peptide or a protein so that this cross-linking (between separate
   molecules) or intramolecular (within the same molecule) reaction can
   happen. Bonds formed by transglutaminase exhibit high resistance to
   proteolytic degradation (proteolysis). The reaction is
          Gln-(C=O)NH[2] + NH[2]-Lys -> Gln-(C=O)NH-Lys + NH[3]
   Transglutaminases can also join a primary amine ( RNH[2] ) to the side
   chain carboxyamide group of a protein/peptide bound glutamine residue
   thus forming an isopeptide bond
          Gln-(C=O)NH[2] + RNH[2] -> Gln-(C=O)NHR + NH[3]
   These enzymes can also deamidate glutamine residues to glutamic acid
   residues in the presence of water
          Gln-(C=O)NH[2] + H[2]O -> Gln-COOH + NH[3]
   Transglutaminase isolated from Streptomyces mobaraensis -bacteria for
   example, is a calcium-independent enzyme. Mammalian transglutaminases
   among other transglutaminases require Ca^2+ ions as a cofactor.
   Transglutaminases were first described in 1959. The exact
   biochemical activity of transglutaminases was discovered in blood
   coagulation protein factor XIII in 1968.
