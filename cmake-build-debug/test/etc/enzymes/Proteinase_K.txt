   In molecular biology Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64, protease K,
   endopeptidase K, Tritirachium alkaline proteinase, Tritirachium album
   serine proteinase, Tritirachium album proteinase K) is a broad-spectrum
   serine protease. The enzyme was discovered in 1974 in
   extracts of the fungus Engyodontium album (formerly Tritirachium
   album). Proteinase K is able to digest hair (keratin), hence, the
   name "Proteinase K". The predominant site of cleavage is the peptide
   bond adjacent to the carboxyl group of aliphatic and aromatic amino
   acids with blocked alpha amino groups. It is commonly used for its
   broad specificity. This enzyme belongs to Peptidase family S8
   (subtilisin). The molecular weight of Proteinase K is 28,900 daltons
   (28.9 kDa).
