   Serine racemase is an enzyme which generates D-serine from L-serine.
   D-serine acts as a neuronal signaling molecule by activating NMDA
   receptors in the brain. In humans, the serine racemase protein is
   encoded by the SRR gene.
   Mammalian serine racemase is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate dependent enzyme
   that catalyzes both the racemization of L-serine to D-serine and also
   the elimination of water from L-serine, generating pyruvate and
   ammonia. The enzyme is physiologically stimulated by divalent
   cations (e.g., magnesium) and is allosterically activated by the
   magnesium/ATP complex.
