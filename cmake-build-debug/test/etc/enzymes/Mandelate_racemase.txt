   Mandelate racemase (EC 5.1.2.2) is a bacterial enzyme which catalyzes
   the interconversion of the enantiomers of mandelate via an enol
   intermediate. This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction
          (S)-mandelate
           (R)-mandelate
   It is a member of the enolase superfamily of enzymes, along with
   muconate lactonizing enzyme and enolase.
