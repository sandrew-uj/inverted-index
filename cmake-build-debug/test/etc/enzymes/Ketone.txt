   Ketone group
   Acetone
   In chemistry, a ketone /|ki:toUn/ is a functional group with the
   structure R[2]C=O, where R can be a variety of carbon-containing
   substituents. Ketones contain a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double
   bond). The simplest ketone is acetone (R = R' = methyl), with the
   formula CH[3]C(O)CH[3]. Many ketones are of great importance in biology
   and in industry. Examples include many sugars (ketoses), many steroids
   (e.g., testosterone), and the solvent acetone.^[page needed]
