   In enzymology, a propionate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.17) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          ATP + propanoate + CoA
           AMP + diphosphate + propanoyl-CoA
   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, propanoate, and CoA, whereas
   its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and propanoyl-CoA.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those
   forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name
   of this enzyme class is propanoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). This
   enzyme is also called propionyl-CoA synthetase. This enzyme
   participates in propanoate metabolism.
