   In enzymology, a 4-chlorobenzoate--CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.33) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          4-chlorobenzoate + CoA + ATP
           4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate
   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-chlorobenzoate, CoA, and ATP,
   whereas its 3 products are 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA, AMP, and diphosphate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those
   forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name
   of this enzyme class is 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase. This enzyme
   participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation. It employs one
   cofactor, magnesium.
