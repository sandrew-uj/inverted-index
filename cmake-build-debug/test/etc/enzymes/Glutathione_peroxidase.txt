   Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (EC 1.11.1.9) is the general name of an
   enzyme family with peroxidase activity whose main biological role is to
   protect the organism from oxidative damage. The biochemical
   function of glutathione peroxidase is to reduce lipid hydroperoxides to
   their corresponding alcohols and to reduce free hydrogen peroxide to
   water.
