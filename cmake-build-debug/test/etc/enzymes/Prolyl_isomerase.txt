   Prolyl isomerase (also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase or PPIase) is
   an enzyme (EC 5.2.1.8) found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that
   interconverts the cis and trans isomers of peptide bonds with the amino
   acid proline. Proline has an unusually conformationally restrained
   peptide bond due to its cyclic structure with its side chain bonded to
   its secondary amine nitrogen. Most amino acids have a strong energetic
   preference for the trans peptide bond conformation due to steric
   hindrance, but proline's unusual structure stabilizes the cis form so
   that both isomers are populated under biologically relevant conditions.
   Proteins with prolyl isomerase activity include cyclophilin, FKBPs, and
   parvulin, although larger proteins can also contain prolyl isomerase
   domains.
