   In biochemistry, a ligase is an enzyme that can catalyze the joining
   (ligation) of two large molecules by forming a new chemical bond. This
   is typically via hydrolysis of a small pendant chemical group on one of
   the larger molecules or the enzyme catalyzing the linking together of
   two compounds, e.g., enzymes that catalyze joining of C-O, C-S, C-N,
   etc. In general, a ligase catalyzes the following reaction:
          Ab + C -> A-C + b
   or sometimes
          Ab + cD -> A-D + b + c + d + e + f
   where the lowercase letters can signify the small, dependent groups.
   Ligase can join two complementary fragments of nucleic acid and repair
   single stranded breaks that arise in double stranded DNA during
   replication.
