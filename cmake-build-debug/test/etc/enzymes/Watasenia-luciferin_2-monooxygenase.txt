   In enzymology, a Watasenia-luciferin 2-monooxygenase (EC 1.13.12.8) is
   an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          Watasenia luciferin + O[2]
           oxidized Watasenia luciferin + CO[2] + hnu
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are Watasenia luciferin and
   O[2], whereas its 3 products are oxidized Watasenia luciferin, CO[2],
   and hn.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically
   those acting on single donors with O[2] as oxidant and incorporation of
   two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen
   incorporated need not be derived from O with incorporation of one atom
   of oxygen (internal monooxygenases o internal mixed-function oxidases).
   The systematic name of this enzyme class is Watasenia-luciferin:oxygen
   2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). This enzyme is also called
   Watasenia-type luciferase.
