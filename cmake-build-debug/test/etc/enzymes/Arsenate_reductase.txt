   Arsenate reductase (glutaredoxin) (EC 1.20.4.1) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          arsenate + glutaredoxin
           arsenite + glutaredoxin disulfide + H[2]O
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are arsenate and glutaredoxin,
   whereas its 3 products are arsenite, glutaredoxin disulfide, and water.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically
   those acting on phosphorus or arsenic in donor with disulfide as
   acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   glutaredoxin:arsenate oxidoreductase.
