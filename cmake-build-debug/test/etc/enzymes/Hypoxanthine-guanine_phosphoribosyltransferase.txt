   Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is an enzyme
   encoded in humans by the HPRT1 gene.
   HGPRT is a transferase that catalyzes conversion of hypoxanthine to
   inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanosine monophosphate. This
   reaction transfers the 5-phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphoribosyl
   1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to the purine. HGPRT plays a central role in the
   generation of purine nucleotides through the purine salvage pathway.
