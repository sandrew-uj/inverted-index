   Aspartate transaminase (AST) or aspartate aminotransferase, also known
   as AspAT/ASAT/AAT or (serum) glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT,
   SGOT), is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase enzyme (EC
   2.6.1.1) that was first described by Arthur Karmen and colleagues in
   1954. AST catalyzes the reversible transfer of an a-amino
   group between aspartate and glutamate and, as such, is an important
   enzyme in amino acid metabolism. AST is found in the liver, heart,
   skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, and red blood cells. Serum AST level,
   serum ALT (alanine transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio)
   are commonly measured clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The
   tests are part of blood panels.
   The half-life of total AST in the circulation approximates 17 hours
   and, on average, 87 hours for mitochondrial AST. Aminotransferase
   is cleared by sinusoidal cells in the liver.
