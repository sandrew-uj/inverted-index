   A phospholipase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids into
   fatty acids and other lipophilic substances. Acids trigger the release
   of bound calcium from cellular stores and the consequent increase in
   free cytosolic Ca^2+, an essential step in calcium signaling to
   regulate intracellular processes. There are four major classes,
   termed A, B, C, and D, which are distinguished by the type of reaction
   which they catalyze:
     * Phospholipase A
          + Phospholipase A1 - cleaves the sn-1 acyl chain (where sn
            refers to stereospecific numbering).
          + Phospholipase A2 - cleaves the sn-2 acyl chain, releasing
            arachidonic acid.
     * Phospholipase B - cleaves both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains; this
       enzyme is also known as a lysophospholipase.
     * Phospholipase C - cleaves before the phosphate, releasing
       diacylglycerol and a phosphate-containing head group. PLCs play a
       central role in signal transduction, releasing the second messenger
       inositol triphosphate.
     * Phospholipase D - cleaves after the phosphate, releasing
       phosphatidic acid and an alcohol.
   Types C and D are considered phosphodiesterases.
   Endothelial lipase is primarily a phospholipase.
   Phospholipase A2 acts on the intact lecithin molecule and hydrolyzes
   the fatty acid esterified to the second carbon atom. The resulting
   products are lysolecithin and a fatty acid. Phospholipase A2 is an
   enzyme present in the venom of bees and viper snakes.
