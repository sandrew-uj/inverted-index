   Group of methylating enzymes
   SET7/9, a representative histone methyltransferase with SAM (red) and
   peptide undergoing methylation (orange. Rendered from PDB file 4J83.)
   The SN2-like methyl transfer reaction. Only the SAM cofactor and
   cytosine base are shown for simplicity.
   Methyltransferases are a large group of enzymes that all methylate
   their substrates but can be split into several subclasses based on
   their structural features. The most common class of methyltransferases
   is class I, all of which contain a Rossmann fold for binding S-Adenosyl
   methionine (SAM). Class II methyltransferases contain a SET domain,
   which are exemplified by SET domain histone methyltransferases, and
   class III methyltransferases, which are membrane associated.
   Methyltransferases can also be grouped as different types utilizing
   different substrates in methyl transfer reactions. These types include
   protein methyltransferases, DNA/RNA methyltransferases, natural product
   methyltransferases, and non-SAM dependent methyltransferases. SAM is
   the classical methyl donor for methyltrasferases, however, examples of
   other methyl donors are seen in nature. The general mechanism for
   methyl transfer is a S[N]2-like nucleophilic attack where the
   methionine sulfur serves as the leaving group and the methyl group
   attached to it acts as the electrophile that transfers the methyl group
   to the enzyme substrate. SAM is converted to S-Adenosyl homocysteine
   (SAH) during this process. The breaking of the SAM-methyl bond and the
   formation of the substrate-methyl bond happen nearly simultaneously.
   These enzymatic reactions are found in many pathways and are implicated
   in genetic diseases, cancer, and metabolic diseases. Another type of
   methyl transfer is the radical S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is the
   methylation of unactivated carbon atoms in primary metabolites,
   proteins, lipids, and RNA.
