   Acetaldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.10) are dehydrogenase enzymes
   which catalyze the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid. The
   oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate can be summarized as follows:
   Acetaldehyde + NAD^+ + Coenzyme A <-> Acetyl-CoA + NADH + H^+
   In humans, there are three known genes which encode this enzymatic
   activity, ALDH1A1, ALDH2, and the more recently discovered ALDH1B1
   (also known as ALDH5). These enzymes are members of the larger class of
   aldehyde dehydrogenases.
   The CAS number for this type of the enzyme is [9028-91-5].
