   In enzymology, a carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase (EC 5.5.1.5) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          3-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate
           3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate,
   3-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate, and one product,
   3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class
   of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   3-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate lyase (decyclizing). This
   enzyme is also called 3-carboxymuconate cyclase. This enzyme
   participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation.
