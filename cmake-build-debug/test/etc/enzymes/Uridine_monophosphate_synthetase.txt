   Uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) (orotate phosphoribosyl
   transferase and orotidine-5'-decarboxylase) is the enzyme that
   catalyses the formation of uridine monophosphate (UMP), an
   energy-carrying molecule in many important biosynthetic pathways.
   In humans, the gene that codes for this enzyme is located on the long
   arm of chromosome 3 (3q13).
