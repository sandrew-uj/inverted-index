   Core structure of penicillins (top) and cephalosporins (bottom).
   b-lactam ring in red.
   Escherichia coli bacteria on the right are sensitive to two beta-lactam
   antibiotics, and do not grow in the semi-circular regions surrounding
   antibiotics. E. coli bacteria on the left are resistant to beta-lactam
   antibiotics, and grow next to one antibiotic (bottom) and are less
   inhibited by another antibiotic (top).
   Beta-lactamases are enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) produced by bacteria that
   provide multi- resistance to b-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins,
   cephalosporins, cephamycins, and carbapenems (ertapenem), although
   carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase
   provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the antibiotics' structure.
   These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular
   structure: a four-atom ring known as a b-lactam. Through hydrolysis,
   the enzyme lactamase breaks the b-lactam ring open, deactivating the
   molecule's antibacterial properties.
   Beta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of
   Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
   Beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms are usually
   secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the
   environment.
