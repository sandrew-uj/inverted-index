   Gamma-glutamyltransferase (also g-glutamyltransferase, GGT, gamma-GT,
   gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; EC 2.3.2.2) is a transferase (a type
   of enzyme) that catalyzes the transfer of gamma-glutamyl functional
   groups from molecules such as glutathione to an acceptor that may be an
   amino acid, a peptide or water (forming glutamate).^:268 GGT
   plays a key role in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, a pathway for the
   synthesis and degradation of glutathione as well as drug and xenobiotic
   detoxification. Other lines of evidence indicate that GGT can also
   exert a pro-oxidant role, with regulatory effects at various levels in
   cellular signal transduction and cellular pathophysiology. This
   transferase is found in many tissues, the most notable one being the
   liver, and has significance in medicine as a diagnostic marker.
