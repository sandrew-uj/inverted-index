   O-succinylbenzoate CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.26), encoded from the menE gene
   in Escherichia coli, catalyzes the fifth reaction in the synthesis of
   menaquinone (vitamin K2). This pathway is called 1,
   4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate biosynthesis I. Vitamin K is a quinone
   that serves as an electron transporter during anaerobic respiration.
   This process of anaerobic respiration allows the bacteria to generate
   the energy required to survive.
