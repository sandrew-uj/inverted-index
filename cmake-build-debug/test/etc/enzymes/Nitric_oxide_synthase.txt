   Nitric oxide synthases (EC 1.14.13.39) (NOSs) are a family of enzymes
   catalyzing the production of nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine. NO is
   an important cellular signaling molecule. It helps modulate vascular
   tone, insulin secretion, airway tone, and peristalsis, and is involved
   in angiogenesis and neural development. It may function as a retrograde
   neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide is mediated in mammals by the
   calcium-calmodulin controlled isoenzymes eNOS (endothelial NOS) and
   nNOS (neuronal NOS). The inducible isoform, iNOS, involved in immune
   response, binds calmodulin at physiologically relevant concentrations,
   and produces NO as an immune defense mechanism, as NO is a free radical
   with an unpaired electron. It is the proximate cause of septic shock
   and may function in autoimmune disease.
   NOS catalyzes the reaction:
     * 2 L-arginine + 3 NADPH + 3 H^+ + 4 O[2]
        2 citrulline +2 nitric oxide + 4 H[2]O + 3
       NADP^+
   NOS isoforms catalyze other leak and side reactions, such as superoxide
   production at the expense of NADPH. As such, this stoichiometry is not
   generally observed, and reflects the three electrons supplied per NO by
   NADPH.
   NOSs are unusual in that they require five cofactors. Eukaryotic NOS
   isozymes are catalytically self-sufficient. The electron flow in the NO
   synthase reaction is: NADPH -> FAD -> FMN -> heme -> O[2].
   Tetrahydrobiopterin provides an additional electron during the
   catalytic cycle which is replaced during turnover. NOS is the only
   known enzyme that binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin
   mononucleotide (FMN), heme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH[4]) and
   calmodulin.^[citation needed]
