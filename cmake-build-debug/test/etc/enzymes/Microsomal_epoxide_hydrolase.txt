   In enzymology, a microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) (EC 3.3.2.9) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis reaction between an epoxide and
   water to form a diol.

   This enzyme plays a role in the uptake of bile salts within the large
   intestine. It functions as a Na+ dependent transporter. This enzyme
   participates in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p450. mEH has
   been identified as playing a large role in the detoxification and
   bioactivation of a wide variety of substrates, such as polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known for their carcinogenic
   properties.
   The human homolog of microsomal epoxide hydrolase is EPHX1 and is
   located on chromosome 1.
