   PDBsum structure summary
   Adenosine deaminase (also known as adenosine aminohydrolase, or ADA) is
   an enzyme (EC 3.5.4.4) involved in purine metabolism. It is needed for
   the breakdown of adenosine from food and for the turnover of nucleic
   acids in tissues.
   Its primary function in humans is the development and maintenance of
   the immune system. However, the full physiological role of ADA is
   not yet completely understood.
