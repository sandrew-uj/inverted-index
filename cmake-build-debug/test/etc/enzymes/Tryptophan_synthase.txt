   Tryptophan synthase or tryptophan synthetase is an enzyme that
   catalyses the final two steps in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. It
   is commonly found in Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista,
   Fungi, and Plantae. However, it is absent from Animalia. It
   is typically found as an a2b2 tetramer. The a subunits catalyze the
   reversible formation of indole and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P)
   from indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP). The b subunits catalyze the
   irreversible condensation of indole and serine to form tryptophan in a
   pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent reaction. Each a active site is
   connected to a b active site by a 25 angstrom long hydrophobic channel
   contained within the enzyme. This facilitates the diffusion of indole
   formed at a active sites directly to b active sites in a process known
   as substrate channeling. The active sites of tryptophan synthase
   are allosterically coupled.
