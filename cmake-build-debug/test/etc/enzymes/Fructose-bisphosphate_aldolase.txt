   Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), often just aldolase, is
   an enzyme catalyzing a reversible reaction that splits the aldol,
   fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone
   phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Aldolase can
   also produce DHAP from other (3S,4R)-ketose 1-phosphates such as
   fructose 1-phosphate and sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate.
   Gluconeogenesis and the Calvin cycle, which are anabolic pathways, use
   the reverse reaction. Glycolysis, a catabolic pathway, uses the forward
   reaction. Aldolase is divided into two classes by mechanism.
   The word aldolase also refers, more generally, to an enzyme that
   performs an aldol reaction (creating an aldol) or its reverse (cleaving
   an aldol), such as Sialic acid aldolase, which forms sialic acid. See
   the list of aldolases.
