   Angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1), or ACE, is a central
   component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which controls blood
   pressure by regulating the volume of fluids in the body. It converts
   the hormone angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
   Therefore, ACE indirectly increases blood pressure by causing blood
   vessels to constrict. ACE inhibitors are widely used as pharmaceutical
   drugs for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
   The enzyme was discovered by Leonard T. Skeggs Jr. in 1956. The
   first crystal structure of human testis ACE was solved in the year 2002
   by R. Natesh in the lab of K. Ravi Acharya and the work was published
   in the journal Nature in January 2003. It is located mainly in the
   capillaries of the lungs but can also be found in endothelial and
   kidney epithelial cells.
   Other less known functions of ACE are degradation of bradykinin,
   substance P and amyloid beta-protein.
