   FK506-binding protein 8 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the
   FKBP8 gene.
   The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin
   protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic
   cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. Unlike
   the other members of the family, this encoded protein does not seem to
   have PPIase/rotamase activity. It may have a role in neurons associated
   with memory function.
