   Leukotriene C4 synthase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the
   LTC4S gene.
   The protein encoded by this gene, LTC4S (or glutathione S-transferase
   II) is an enzyme that converts leukotriene A4 and glutathione to create
   leukotriene C4. This is a member of MAPEG family of transmembrane
   proteins. A trimer of Leukotriene C4 synthase is localized on the outer
   nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms a complex
   with 5-Lipoxygenase-activating protein. This protein is remotely
   related to microsomal glutathione S-transferase.
