   A halohydrin dehalogenase is an enzyme involved in the bacterial
   degradation of vicinal halohydrins. In several species of bacteria, it
   catalyses the dehalogenation of halohydrins to produce the
   corresponding epoxides. Different isoforms of the enzyme fall into
   one of three groups, A, B or C. Halogenases of the same class are
   genetically similar, but differ greatly from halogenases from a
   different group. Currently the most well-studied isoform is
   HheC which is purified from the bacterial species Agrobacterium
   radiobacter. The ability to dehalogenate organic compounds as well
   as form enantiomeric selective epoxides have generated interest in the
   potential of this enzyme in the biochemical field.
