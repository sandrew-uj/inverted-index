   DNA ligase is a specific type of enzyme, a ligase, (EC 6.5.1.1) that
   facilitates the joining of DNA strands together by catalyzing the
   formation of a phosphodiester bond. It plays a role in repairing
   single-strand breaks in duplex DNA in living organisms, but some forms
   (such as DNA ligase IV) may specifically repair double-strand breaks
   (i.e. a break in both complementary strands of DNA). Single-strand
   breaks are repaired by DNA ligase using the complementary strand of the
   double helix as a template, with DNA ligase creating the final
   phosphodiester bond to fully repair the DNA.
   DNA ligase is used in both DNA repair and DNA replication (see
   Mammalian ligases). In addition, DNA ligase has extensive use in
   molecular biology laboratories for recombinant DNA experiments (see
   Research applications). Purified DNA ligase is used in gene cloning to
   join DNA molecules together to form recombinant DNA.
