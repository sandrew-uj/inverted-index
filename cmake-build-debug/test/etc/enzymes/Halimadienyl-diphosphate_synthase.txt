   Halimadienyl-diphosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.16, Rv3377c, halimadienyl
   diphosphate synthase, tuberculosinol diphosphate synthase,
   halima-5(6),13-dien-15-yl-diphosphate lyase (cyclizing)) is an enzyme
   with systematic name halima-5,13-dien-15-yl-diphosphate lyase
   (decyclizing). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical
   reaction
          geranylgeranyl diphosphate
           tuberculosinyl diphosphate
   This enzyme requires Mg^2+ for activity.
