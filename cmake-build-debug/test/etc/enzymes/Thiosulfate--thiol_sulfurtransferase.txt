   In enzymology, a thiosulfate-thiol sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.3) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          thiosulfate + 2 glutathione
           sulfite + glutathione disulfide + sulfide
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are thiosulfate and
   glutathione, whereas its 3 products are sulfite, glutathione disulfide,
   and sulfide.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the
   sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The
   systematic name of this enzyme class is thiosulfate:thiol
   sulfurtransferase. Other names in common use include
   glutathione-dependent thiosulfate reductase, sulfane reductase, and
   sulfane sulfurtransferase. This enzyme participates in glutathione
   metabolism.
