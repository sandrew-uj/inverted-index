   An acid anhydride is a type of chemical compound derived by the removal
   of water molecules from an acid.
   In organic chemistry, organic acid anhydrides contain the functional
   group R(CO)O(CO)R'. Organic acid anhydrides often form when one
   equivalent of water is removed from two equivalents of an organic acid
   in a dehydration reaction.
   In inorganic chemistry, an acid anhydride refers to an acidic oxide, an
   oxide that reacts with water to form an oxyacid (an inorganic acid that
   contains oxygen or carbonic acid), or with a base to form a salt.
