   ATPases (EC 3.6.1.3, adenylpyrophosphatase, ATP monophosphatase,
   triphosphatase, SV40 T-antigen, adenosine 5'-triphosphatase, ATP
   hydrolase, complex V (mitochondrial electron transport), (Ca^2+ +
   Mg^2+)-ATPase, HCO[3]^--ATPase, adenosine triphosphatase) are a class
   of enzymes that catalyze the decomposition of ATP into ADP and a free
   phosphate ion or the inverse reaction. This
   dephosphorylation reaction releases energy, which the enzyme (in most
   cases) harnesses to drive other chemical reactions that would not
   otherwise occur. This process is widely used in all known forms of
   life.
   Some such enzymes are integral membrane proteins (anchored within
   biological membranes), and move solutes across the membrane, typically
   against their concentration gradient. These are called transmembrane
   ATPases.
