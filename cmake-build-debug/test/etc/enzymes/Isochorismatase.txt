   In enzymology, an isochorismatase (EC 3.3.2.1) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          isochorismate + H[2]O
           2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoate + pyruvate
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are isochorismate and H[2]O,
   whereas its two products are 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoate and
   pyruvate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this
   enzyme class is isochorismate pyruvate-hydrolase. Other names in common
   use include 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate synthase,
   2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoate synthase, and
   2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoic synthase. This enzyme participates in
   the biosynthesis of siderophore group (nonribosomal).
