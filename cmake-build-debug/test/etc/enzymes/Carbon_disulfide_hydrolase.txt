   Carbon disulfide hydrolase is an enzyme with a molecular mass of 23,576
   Da. The enzyme is hexadecameric. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of carbon
   disulfide.
   Carbon disulfide occurs naturally in the mudpots of volcanic
   solfataras. It is a precursor to hydrogen sulfide, which is an electron
   donor. The hyperthermophilic Acidianus strain was found to convert
   CS[2]into H[2]S and CO[2].
   The enzyme is similar to that of carbonic anhydrases. The enzyme
   monomer of CS[2] hydrolase displays a typical b-carbonic anhydrase fold
   and active site. Two of these monomers form a closely intertwined dimer
   with a central b-sheet capped by ana-helical domain. Four dimers form a
   square octameric ring through interactions of the long arms at the N
   and C termini. Similar ring structures have been seen in strains of
   carbonic anhydrases, however, in CS[2] hydrolase is an enzyme
   consisting of two octameric rings form a hexadecamer by interlocking at
   right angles to each other. This results in the blocking of the
   entrance to the active site and the formation of a single 15-AA-long,
   highly hydrophobic tunnel that functions as a specificity filter. This
   provides a key difference between carbonic anhydrase and CS[2]
   hydrolase. This tunnel determines the enzyme's substrate specificity
   for CS[2], which is hydrophobic as well.
