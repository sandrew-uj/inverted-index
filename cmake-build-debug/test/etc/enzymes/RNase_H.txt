   Ribonuclease H (abbreviated RNase H or RNH) is a family of
   non-sequence-specific endonuclease enzymes that catalyze the cleavage
   of RNA in an RNA/DNA substrate via a hydrolytic mechanism. Members of
   the RNase H family can be found in nearly all organisms, from bacteria
   to archaea to eukaryotes.
   The family is divided into evolutionarily related groups with slightly
   different substrate preferences, broadly designated ribonuclease H1 and
   H2. The human genome encodes both H1 and H2. Human ribonuclease H2
   is a heterotrimeric complex composed of three subunits, mutations in
   any of which are among the genetic causes of a rare disease known as
   Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. A third type, closely related to H2, is
   found only in a few prokaryotes, whereas H1 and H2 occur in all
   domains of life. Additionally, RNase H1-like retroviral
   ribonuclease H domains occur in multidomain reverse transcriptase
   proteins, which are encoded by retroviruses such as HIV and are
   required for viral replication.
   In eukaryotes, ribonuclease H1 is involved in DNA replication of the
   mitochondrial genome. Both H1 and H2 are involved in genome maintenance
   tasks such as processing of R-loop structures.
