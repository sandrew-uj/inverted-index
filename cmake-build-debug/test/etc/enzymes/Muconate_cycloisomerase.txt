   Muconate lactonizing enzymes (EC 5.5.1.1, muconate cycloisomerase I,
   cis,cis-muconate-lactonizing enzyme, cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase,
   4-carboxymethyl-4-hydroxyisocrotonolactone lyase (decyclizing), CatB,
   MCI, MLE, 2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate lyase (decyclizing)) are
   involved in the breakdown of lignin-derived aromatics, catechol and
   protocatechuate, to citric acid cycle intermediates as a part of the
   b-ketoadipate pathway in soil microbes. Some bacterial species are also
   capable of dehalogenating chloroaromatic compounds by the action of
   chloromuconate lactonizing enzymes. MLEs consist of several strands
   which have variable reaction favorable parts therefore the
   configuration of the strands affect its ability to accept protons.
   The bacterial MLEs belong to the enolase superfamily, several
   structures from which are known. MLEs have an identifying
   structure made up of two proteins and two Magnesium ions as well as
   various classes depending on whether it is bacterial or
   eukaryotic.  The reaction mechanism that MLEs undergo are the
   reverse of beta-elimination in which the enolate alpha-carbon is
   protonated. MLEs can undergo mutations caused by a deletion of catB
   structural genes which can cause some bacteria to lose its functions
   such as the ability to grow. Additional mutations to MLEs can cause
   its structure and function to alter and could cause the conformation to
   change therefore making it an inactive enzyme that is unable to bind
   its substrate. There is another enzyme called Mandelate Racemase
   that is very similar to MLEs in the structural way as well as them both
   being a part of the enolase superfamily. They both have the same end
   product even though they undergo different chemical reactions in order
   to reach the end product.
