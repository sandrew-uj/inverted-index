   An acid hydrolase is an enzyme that works best at acidic pHs. It is
   commonly located in lysosomes, which are acidic on the inside. Acid
   hydrolases may be nucleases, proteases, glycosidases, lipases,
   phosphatases, sulfatases and phospholipases and make up the
   approximately 50 degradative enzymes of the lysosome that break apart
   biological matter.
   types of Acid Hydrolase:
   -Nucleases
   -Lipase: for example lysosomal acid lipase.
   -Proteases
   -Glycosidases
