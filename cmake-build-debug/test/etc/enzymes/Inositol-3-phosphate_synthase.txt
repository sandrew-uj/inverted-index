   In enzymology, an inositol-3-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          D-glucose 6-phosphate
           1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-glucose 6-phosphate, and one
   product, 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class
   of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   1D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate lyase (isomerizing). Other names in common
   use include myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, D-glucose 6-phosphate
   cycloaldolase, inositol 1-phosphate synthatase, glucose 6-phosphate
   cyclase, inositol 1-phosphate synthetase, glucose-6-phosphate inositol
   monophosphate cycloaldolase, glucocycloaldolase, and
   1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate lyase (isomerizing).
   This enzyme participates in streptomycin biosynthesis and inositol
   phosphate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, NAD+. The reaction this
   enzyme catalyses represents the first committed step in the production
   of all inositol-containing compounds, including phospholipids, either
   directly or by salvage. The enzyme exists in a cytoplasmic form in a
   wide range of plants, animals, and fungi. It has also been detected in
   several bacteria and a chloroplast form is observed in alga and higher
   plants. Inositol phosphates play an important role in signal
   transduction.
   In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast), the transcriptional
   regulation of the INO1 gene encoding inositol-3-phosphate synthase has
   been studied in detail and its expression is sensitive to the
   availability of phospholipid precursors as well as growth phase.
   The regulation of the structural gene encoding
   1L-myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase has also been analyzed at the
   transcriptional level in the aquatic angiosperm, Spirodela polyrrhiza
   (Giant duckweed) and the halophyte, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum
   (Common ice plant).
   In prokaryotes, myo-D-inositol phosphate synthase was discovered by
   Bachhawat and Mande in 1999 (reported in Journal of Molecular Biology).
   The existence of inositol in prokaryotes is not extensive, but the
   discovery of this enzyme first in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nucleated
   activity towards finding its inhibitors.
