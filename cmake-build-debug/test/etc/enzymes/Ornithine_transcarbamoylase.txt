   Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) (also called ornithine
   carbamoyltransferase) is an enzyme (EC 2.1.3.3) that catalyzes the
   reaction between carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and ornithine (Orn) to form
   citrulline (Cit) and phosphate (P[i]). There are two classes of OTC:
   anabolic and catabolic. This article focuses on anabolic OTC. Anabolic
   OTC facilitates the sixth step in the biosynthesis of the amino acid
   arginine in prokaryotes. In contrast, mammalian OTC plays an
   essential role in the urea cycle, the purpose of which is to capture
   toxic ammonia and transform it into urea, a less toxic nitrogen source,
   for excretion.
