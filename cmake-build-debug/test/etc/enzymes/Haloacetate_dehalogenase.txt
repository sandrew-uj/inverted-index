   In enzymology, a haloacetate dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.3) is an enzyme
   that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          haloacetate + H[2]O
           glycolate + halide
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are haloacetate and H[2]O,
   whereas its two products are glycolate and halide. For examples, in the
   case of fluoroacetate in will produce glycolate and fluoride.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, one of the largest
   known enzyme families comprising approximately 1% of the genes in the
   human genome, exists as a homodimer, and acts specifically halide bonds
   in carbon-halide compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   haloacetate halidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called monohaloacetate
   dehalogenase and fluoroacetate dehalogenase. This enzyme participates
   in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation and 1,2-dichloroethane
   degradation.
