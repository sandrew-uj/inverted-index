   Argininosuccinate synthase or synthetase (ASS; EC 6.3.4.5) is an enzyme
   that catalyzes the synthesis of argininosuccinate from citrulline and
   aspartate. In humans, argininosuccinate synthase is encoded by the ASS
   gene located on chromosome 9.
   ASS is responsible for the third step of the urea cycle and one of the
   reactions of the citrulline-NO cycle.
