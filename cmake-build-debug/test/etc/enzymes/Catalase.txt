   Catalase is a common enzyme found in nearly all living organisms
   exposed to oxygen (such as bacteria, plants, and animals) which
   catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and
   oxygen. It is a very important enzyme in protecting the cell from
   oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Likewise, catalase
   has one of the highest turnover numbers of all enzymes; one catalase
   molecule can convert millions of hydrogen peroxide molecules to water
   and oxygen each second.
   Catalase is a tetramer of four polypeptide chains, each over 500 amino
   acids long. It contains four iron-containing heme groups that allow
   the enzyme to react with hydrogen peroxide. The optimum pH for human
   catalase is approximately 7, and has a fairly broad maximum: the
   rate of reaction does not change appreciably between pH 6.8 and
   7.5. The pH optimum for other catalases varies between 4 and 11
   depending on the species. The optimum temperature also varies by
   species.
