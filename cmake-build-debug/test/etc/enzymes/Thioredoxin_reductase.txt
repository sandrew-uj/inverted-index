   Thioredoxin reductases (TR, TrxR) (EC 1.8.1.9) are the only known
   enzymes to reduce thioredoxin (Trx). Two classes of thioredoxin
   reductase have been identified: one class in bacteria and some
   eukaryotes and one in animals. In bacteria TrxR also catalyzes the
   reduction of glutaredoxin like proteins known as NrdH. Both
   classes are flavoproteins which function as homodimers. Each monomer
   contains a FAD prosthetic group, a NADPH binding domain, and an active
   site containing a redox-active disulfide bond.
