   Renin (etymology and pronunciation), also known as an
   angiotensinogenase, is an aspartic protease protein and enzyme secreted
   by the kidneys that participates in the body's
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)--also known as the
   renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis--that mediates the volume of
   extracellular fluid (blood plasma, lymph and interstitial fluid) and
   arterial vasoconstriction. Thus, it regulates the body's mean arterial
   blood pressure.
   Renin isn't commonly referred to as a hormone, albeit it having a
   receptor, the (pro)renin receptor, also known as the renin receptor and
   prorenin receptor (see also below), as well as enzymatic activity
   with which it hydrolyzes angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.
