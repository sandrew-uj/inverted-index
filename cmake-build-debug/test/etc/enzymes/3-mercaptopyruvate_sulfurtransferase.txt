   In enzymology, a 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.2) is
   an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reactions of 3-mercaptopyruvate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the
   sulfurtransferases. This enzyme participates in cysteine
   metabolism. It is encoded by the MPST gene.
   The enzyme is of interest because it provides a pathway for
   detoxification of cyanide, especially since it occurs widely in the
   cytosol and distributed broadly.
