   Dihydroxybenzenes are organic chemical compounds in which two hydroxyl
   groups are substituted onto a benzene ring. These aromatic compounds
   are classed as phenols. There are three isomer: 1,2-dihydroxybenzene
   (the ortho isomer) is commonly known as catechol, 1,3-dihydroxybenzene
   (the meta isomer) is commonly known as resorcinol, and
   1,4-dihydroxybenzene (the para isomer) is commonly known as
   hydroquinone.

   All three of these compounds are colorless to white granular solids at
   room temperature and pressure, but upon exposure to oxygen they may
   darken. All three isomers have the chemical formula C[6]H[6]O[2].
   Similar to other phenols, the hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring of a
   benzenediol are weakly acidic. Each benzenediol can lose an H^+ from
   one of the hydroxyls to form a type of phenolate ion.
   The Dakin oxidation is an organic redox reaction in which an ortho- or
   para-hydroxylated phenyl aldehyde or ketone reacts with hydrogen
   peroxide in base to form a benzenediol and a carboxylate. Overall, the
   carbonyl group is oxidized, and the hydrogen peroxide is reduced.
