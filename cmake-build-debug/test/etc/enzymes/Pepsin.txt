   Pepsin is an endopeptidase that breaks down proteins into smaller
   peptides. It is produced in the gastric chief cells of the stomach
   lining and is one of the main digestive enzymes in the digestive
   systems of humans and many other animals, where it helps digest the
   proteins in food. Pepsin is an aspartic protease, using a catalytic
   aspartate in its active site.
   It is one of three principal proteases in the human digestive system,
   the other two being chymotrypsin and trypsin. During the process of
   digestion, these enzymes, each of which is specialized in severing
   links between particular types of amino acids, collaborate to break
   down dietary proteins into their components, i.e., peptides and amino
   acids, which can be readily absorbed by the small intestine. The
   cleavage specificity of pepsin is broad, but some amino acids like
   tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan increase the probability of
   cleavage.
   Pepsin's proenzyme, pepsinogen, is released by the gastric chief cells
   in the stomach wall, and upon mixing with the hydrochloric acid of the
   gastric juice, pepsinogen activates to become pepsin.
