   A deoxyribonuclease (DNase, for short) is an enzyme that catalyzes the
   hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone,
   thus degrading DNA. Deoxyribonucleases are one type of nuclease, a
   generic term for enzymes capable of hydrolyzing phosphodiester bonds
   that link nucleotides. A wide variety of deoxyribonucleases are known,
   which differ in their substrate specificities, chemical mechanisms, and
   biological functions.
