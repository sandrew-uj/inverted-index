   HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase,
   official symbol HMGCR) is the rate-controlling enzyme (NADH-dependent,
   EC 1.1.1.88; NADPH-dependent, EC 1.1.1.34) of the mevalonate pathway,
   the metabolic pathway that produces cholesterol and other isoprenoids.
   HMGCR catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, a
   necessary step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Normally in
   mammalian cells this enzyme is competitively suppressed so that its
   effect is controlled. This enzyme is the target of the widely available
   cholesterol-lowering drugs known collectively as the statins, which
   help treat dyslipidemia.
   HMG-CoA reductase is anchored in the membrane of the endoplasmic
   reticulum, and was long regarded as having seven transmembrane domains,
   with the active site located in a long carboxyl terminal domain in the
   cytosol. More recent evidence shows it to contain eight transmembrane
   domains.
   In humans, the gene for HMG-CoA reductase (NADPH) is located on the
   long arm of the fifth chromosome (5q13.3-14). Related enzymes
   having the same function are also present in other animals, plants and
   bacteria.
