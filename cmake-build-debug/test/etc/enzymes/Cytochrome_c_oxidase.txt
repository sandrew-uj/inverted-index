   The enzyme cytochrome c oxidase or Complex IV, EC 1.9.3.1, is a large
   transmembrane protein complex found in bacteria, archaea, and the
   mitochondria of eukaryotes.
   It is the last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of
   cells located in the membrane. It receives an electron from each of
   four cytochrome c molecules, and transfers them to one dioxygen
   molecule, converting the molecular oxygen to two molecules of water. In
   this process it binds four protons from the inner aqueous phase to make
   two water molecules, and translocates another four protons across the
   membrane, increasing the transmembrane difference of proton
   electrochemical potential which the ATP synthase then uses to
   synthesize ATP.
