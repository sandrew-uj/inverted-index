   Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) is an enzyme (EC 1.17.4.4) that
   reduces vitamin K after it has been oxidised in the carboxylation of
   glutamic acid residues in blood coagulation enzymes. VKOR is a member
   of a large family of predicted enzymes that are present in vertebrates,
   Drosophila, plants, bacteria and archaea. In some plant and
   bacterial homologues, the VKOR domain is fused with domains of the
   thioredoxin family of oxidoreductases.
   Four cysteine residues and one residue, which is either serine or
   threonine, are identified as likely active-site residues. Solved
   bacterial VKOR structures has enabled more insights into the catalytic
   mechanism. All VKORs are transmembrane proteins with at least three TM
   helices at the catalytic core. The quinone to be reduced is bound by a
   redox-active CXXC motif in the C-terminal helices, similar to the DsbB
   active site. Two other cysteines to the N-terminal are located in a
   loop outside of the transmembrane region; they relay electrons with a
   redox protein (or in the case of the bacterial homolog, its own fused
   domain).
   The human gene for VKOR is called VKORC1 (VKOR complex subunit 1). It
   is the target of anticoagulant warfarin. Its partner is a redox protein
   with an unknown identity. There is also a similar gene called
   VKORC1L1.
