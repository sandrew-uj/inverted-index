   In enzymology, a chloromuconate cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.7) is an
   enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          2-chloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate
           3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate,
   2-chloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate, and one product,
   3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class
   of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   2-chloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate lyase (decyclizing). This
   enzyme is also called muconate cycloisomerase II. This enzyme
   participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation and
   1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation. It employs one cofactor, manganese.
