   In enzymology, a chalcone isomerase (EC 5.5.1.6) is an enzyme that
   catalyzes the chemical reaction
          a chalcone
           a flavanone
   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, a chalcone, and one product, a
   flavanone.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class
   of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is
   flavanone lyase (decyclizing). This enzyme is also called
   chalcone-flavanone isomerase. This enzyme participates in flavonoid
   biosynthesis.
   The Petunia hybrida (Petunia) genome contains two genes coding for very
   similar enzymes, ChiA and ChiB, but only the first seems to encode a
   functional chalcone isomerase.
