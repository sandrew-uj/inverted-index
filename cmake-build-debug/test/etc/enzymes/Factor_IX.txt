   Factor IX (or Christmas factor) (EC 3.4.21.22) is one of the serine
   proteases of the coagulation system; it belongs to peptidase family S1.
   Deficiency of this protein causes haemophilia B. It was discovered in
   1952 after a young boy named Stephen Christmas was found to be lacking
   this exact factor, leading to haemophilia.
   Coagulation factor IX is on the World Health Organization's List of
   Essential Medicines.
