   Syn-copalyl-diphosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.14, OsCyc1, OsCPSsyn,
   syn-CPP synthase, syn-copalyl diphosphate synthase) is an enzyme with
   systematic name 9alpha-copalyl-diphosphate lyase (decyclizing).
   This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction
          geranylgeranyl diphosphate
           9alpha-copalyl diphosphate
   This enzyme requires a divalent metal ion, preferably Mg^2+, for
   activity.
