   Cystathionine beta-lyase (EC 4.4.1.8), also commonly referred to as CBL
   or b-cystathionase, is an enzyme that primarily catalyzes the following
   a,b-elimination reaction
   Reaction catalyzed by cystathionine beta-lyase
   Thus, the substrate of this enzyme is L-cystathionine, whereas its 3
   products are homocysteine, pyruvate, and ammonia.
   Found in plants, bacteria, and yeast, cystathionine beta-lyase is an
   essential part of the methionine biosynthesis pathway as homocysteine
   can be directly converted into methionine by methionine
   synthase. The enzyme belongs to the g-family of
   PLP-dependent enzymes due to its use of a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)
   cofactor to cleave cystathionine. The enzyme also belongs to the
   family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The
   systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cystathionine
   L-homocysteine-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming). This enzyme
   participates in 5 metabolic pathways: methionine metabolism, cysteine
   metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and
   sulfur metabolism.
