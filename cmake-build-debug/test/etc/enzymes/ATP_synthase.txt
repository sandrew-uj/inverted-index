   ATP synthase is a protein that catalyzes the formation of the energy
   storage molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using adenosine
   diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (P[i]). It is classified
   under ligases as it changes ADP by the formation of P-O bond
   (phosphodiester bond). The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase
   is:
     * ADP + P[i] + 2H^+[out] <=> ATP + H[2]O + 2H^+[in]
   The formation of ATP from ADP and P[i] is energetically unfavorable and
   would normally proceed in the reverse direction. In order to drive this
   reaction forward, ATP synthase couples ATP synthesis during cellular
   respiration to an electrochemical gradient created by the difference in
   proton (H^+) concentration across the inner mitochondrial membrane in
   eukaryotes or the plasma membrane in bacteria. During photosynthesis in
   plants, ATP is synthesized by ATP synthase using a proton gradient
   created in the thylakoid lumen through the thylakoid membrane and into
   the chloroplast stroma.
   Eukaryotic ATP synthases are F-ATPases, running "in reverse" for an
   ATPase. This article deals mainly with this type. An F-ATPase consists
   of two main subunits, F[O] and F[1], which has a rotational motor
   mechanism allowing for ATP production. ATP synthase is a
   molecular machine.
