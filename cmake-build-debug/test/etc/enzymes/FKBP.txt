   FKBP, or FK506 binding protein, is a family of proteins that have
   prolyl isomerase activity and are related to the cyclophilins in
   function, though not in amino acid sequence. FKBPs have been
   identified in many eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans, and
   function as protein folding chaperones for proteins containing proline
   residues. Along with cyclophilin, FKBPs belong to the immunophilin
   family.
   FKBP12 is notable in humans for binding the immunosuppressant molecule
   tacrolimus (originally designated FK506), which is used in treating
   patients after organ transplant and patients suffering from autoimmune
   disorders. Tacrolimus has been found to reduce episodes of organ
   rejection over a related treatment, the drug ciclosporin, which binds
   cyclophilin. Both the FKBP-tacrolimus complex and the
   cyclosporin-cyclophilin complex inhibit a phosphatase called
   calcineurin, thus blocking signal transduction in the T-lymphocyte
   transduction pathway. This therapeutic role is not related to
   prolyl isomerase activity.
