   Glutamine synthetase (GS) (EC 6.3.1.2) is an enzyme that plays an
   essential role in the metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the
   condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine:
   Glutamate + ATP + NH[3] -> Glutamine + ADP + phosphate
   Glutamine synthetase reaction.
   Glutamine synthetase uses ammonia produced by nitrate reduction, amino
   acid degradation, and photorespiration. The amide group of
   glutamate is a nitrogen source for the synthesis of glutamine pathway
   metabolites.
   Other reactions may take place via GS. Competition between ammonium ion
   and water, their binding affinities, and the concentration of ammonium
   ion, influences glutamine synthesis and glutamine hydrolysis. Glutamine
   is formed if an ammonium ion attacks the acyl-phosphate intermediate,
   while glutamate is remade if water attacks the intermediate.
   Ammonium ion binds more strongly than water to GS due to electrostatic
   forces between a cation and a negatively charged pocket. Another
   possible reaction is upon NH[2]OH binding to GS, rather than NH[4]+,
   yields g-glutamylhydroxamate.
