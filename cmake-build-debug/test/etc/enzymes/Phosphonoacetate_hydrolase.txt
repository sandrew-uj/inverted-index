   In enzymology, a phosphonoacetate hydrolase (EC 3.11.1.2) is an enzyme
   that catalyzes the chemical reaction
          phosphonoacetate + H[2]O
           acetate + phosphate
   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphonoacetate and H[2]O,
   whereas its two products are acetate and phosphate.
   This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those
   acting on carbon-phosphorus bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme
   class is phosphonoacetate phosphonohydrolase. This enzyme participates
   in aminophosphonate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, zinc.
