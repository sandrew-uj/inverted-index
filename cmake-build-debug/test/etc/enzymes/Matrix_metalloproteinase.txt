   Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), also known as matrix
   metallopeptidases or matrixins, are metalloproteinases that are
   calcium-dependent zinc-containing endopeptidases; other family
   members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. The MMPs belong to
   a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily.
   Collectively, these enzymes are capable of degrading all kinds of
   extracellular matrix proteins, but also can process a number of
   bioactive molecules. They are known to be involved in the cleavage of
   cell surface receptors, the release of apoptotic ligands (such as the
   FAS ligand), and chemokine/cytokine inactivation. MMPs are also
   thought to play a major role in cell behaviors such as cell
   proliferation, migration (adhesion/dispersion), differentiation,
   angiogenesis, apoptosis, and host defense.
   They were first described in vertebrates (1962), including humans,
   but have since been found in invertebrates and plants. They are
   distinguished from other endopeptidases by their dependence on metal
   ions as cofactors, their ability to degrade extracellular matrix, and
   their specific evolutionary DNA sequence.
