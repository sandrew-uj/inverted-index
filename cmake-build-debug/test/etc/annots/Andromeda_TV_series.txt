   Main article: List of Andromeda episodes

   Thousands of years in the future, the Systems Commonwealth is a
   constitutional monarchy based in a distant star system called
   Tarn-Vedra. Mankind is a part of the Commonwealth. It spans the Milky
   Way, Triangulum, and Andromeda, with Tarn-Vedra near its core. The
   Commonwealth is at war with the Magog, a predatory humanoid species
   with bat-like faces that is dedicated to war. Peace talks led the
   Commonwealth to cede a key world to the Magog, that of the
   Nietzscheans; in response, the Nietzscheans secretly attempted to usurp
   control of the Commonwealth. Dylan Hunt is the captain of the
   Commonwealth starship Andromeda Ascendant. Its computer is a powerful
   artificial intelligence which can emit a holographic interface persona
   in the form of a woman, called "Andromeda" or "Rommie". Caught by
   surprise in the first engagement of the Nietzschean uprising, the crew
   evacuates. The Andromeda, with Hunt aboard, is caught at the edge of
   the event horizon of a black hole, freezing both in time.

   303 years later, in CY 10087 (approx 5167 AD), the crew of the salvage
   ship Eureka Maru locates the ship. The Systems Commonwealth has fallen,
   and the era known as The Long Night has begun. Hunt recruits the
   salvage crew to join him in an attempt to restore the Systems
   Commonwealth and "rekindle the light of civilization". The salvage crew
   comprises its leader, Beka Valentine, a con-artist and expert pilot; a
   super-genius engineer named Seamus Zelanzy Harper (rescued from
   Nietzschean-enslaved Earth by Beka) who can plug his mind directly into
   computer systems; Trance Gemini, a mysterious alien of unknown origin
   whose innocent demeanor hides a surprisingly old soul, and Rev Bem, a
   Magog who has adopted a non-violent, Taoist-like religion called The
   Way ("Rev" being short for "Reverend"). The salvage crew's beneficiary
   brings along an insurance policy in the form of a Nietzschean mercenary
   named Tyr Anasazi.
