   In a small Buckinghamshire village forty minutes by bus away from
   Reading and 8 miles from the Bingo club in Aylesbury, Matilda Wormwood
   is born to Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood. She immediately shows amazing
   precocity, learning to speak at age one and to read at age three and a
   half, perusing all the children's books in the library by the age of
   four and three months and moving on to longer classics such as Great
   Expectations and Jane Eyre. However, her parents ignore and abuse her
   and completely refuse to acknowledge her abilities, and Matilda finds
   herself forced to pull mild pranks on them (such as gluing her father's
   hat to his head, sticking a parrot in the chimney to simulate a burglar
   or ghost, and bleaching her father's hair) to avoid getting frustrated.

   At the age of five and a half, Matilda enters school and befriends her
   teacher Jennifer Honey, who is astonished by her intellectual
   abilities. Miss Honey tries to move Matilda into a higher class, but
   the tyrannical headmistress, Miss Agatha Trunchbull, refuses. Miss
   Honey also tries to talk to Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood about their
   daughter's intelligence, but they ignore her, with the mother
   contending "brainy-ness" is an undesirable trait in a little girl.

   Miss Trunchbull later confronts a girl called Amanda Thripp for wearing
   pigtails (the headmistress repeatedly displays a dislike of long hair
   throughout the book) and does a hammer throw with the girl over the
   playground fence. A boy called Bruce Bogtrotter is later caught by the
   cook stealing a piece of Miss Trunchbull's cake; the headmistress makes
   him eat an 18 in (45.72 cm) wide cake in front of the assembly, then
   smashes the platter over his head.

   Matilda quickly develops a particularly strong bond with Miss Honey,
   and watches as Trunchbull terrorizes her students with deliberately
   creative, over-the-top punishments to prevent parents from believing
   them, such as throwing them in a dark closet dubbed "The Chokey", which
   is lined with nails and broken glass. When Matilda's friend Lavender
   plays a practical joke on Trunchbull by placing a newt in her jug of
   water, Matilda uses an unexpected power of telekinesis to tip the glass
   of water containing the newt onto Trunchbull.

   Matilda reveals her new powers to Miss Honey, who confides that after
   her wealthy father, Dr. Magnus Honey, suspiciously died, she was raised
   by an abusive aunt, revealed to be Miss Trunchbull. Trunchbull appears
   (among other misdeeds) to be withholding her niece's inheritance, as
   Miss Honey has to live in poverty in a derelict farm cottage, and her
   salary is being paid into Miss Trunchbull's bank account for the first
   10 years of her teaching career (while she is restricted to -L-1 per
   week in pocket money). Preparing to avenge Miss Honey, Matilda
   practices her telekinesis at home. Later, during a sadistic lesson that
   Miss Trunchbull is teaching, Matilda telekinetically raises a piece of
   chalk to the blackboard and begins to use it to write, posing as the
   spirit of "Magnus". Addressing Miss Trunchbull using her first name,
   "Magnus" demands that Miss Trunchbull hand over Miss Honey's house and
   wages and leave the school, causing Miss Trunchbull to faint.

   The next day, the school's deputy headmaster Mr. Trilby visits
   Trunchbull's house and finds it empty, except for signs of Trunchbull's
   hasty exit. She is never seen again, and the house and property are
   finally and rightfully returned to Miss Honey. Trilby becomes the new
   headmaster, proving himself to be capable and good-natured,
   overwhelmingly improving the school's atmosphere and curriculum, and
   quickly moving Matilda into the top-form class with the 11-year-olds.
   Rather to Matilda's relief, she soon is no longer capable of
   telekinesis; Miss Honey explains this is because Matilda is using her
   brain's energy on a more challenging curriculum.

   Matilda continues to visit Miss Honey at her house regularly, returning
   home one day to find her parents and her older brother Michael hastily
   packing to leave for Spain. Miss Honey explains this is because the
   police found out Mr. Wormwood has been selling stolen cars. Matilda
   asks permission to live with Miss Honey, to which her parents rather
   distractedly agree. Matilda and Miss Honey find their happy ending, as
   the Wormwoods drive away, never to be seen again.
