   Call It Sleep is the story of a Galician Jewish immigrant family in New
   York in the early part of the 20th century. Six-year-old David Schearl
   has a close and loving relationship with his mother Genya but his
   father Albert is aloof, resentful and angry toward his wife and son.
   David's development takes place between fear of his father's potential
   violence and the degradation of life in the streets of the tenement
   slums. After the family has begun settling into their life in New York,
   Genya's sister Bertha arrives from Austrian Galicia (today Western
   Ukraine) to stay with them. Bertha's coarse and uninhibited nature
   offends Albert and her presence in the home renews and exacerbates the
   tension in the family.

   Listening to conversations between Genya and Bertha, David begins to
   pick up hints that his mother may have had an affair with a non-Jewish
   man in Galicia before marrying Albert. David imagines the romantic
   setting "in the corn fields" where the pair would secretly meet. Bertha
   leaves the Schearl household when she marries Nathan, a man she met at
   the dentist's office. She and Nathan open a candy store where they live
   with Nathan's two daughters, Polly and Esther.

   David begins his religious education and is quickly identified by his
   rabbi teacher, Reb Yidel, as an exceptional student of Hebrew. David
   becomes fascinated with the story of Isaiah 6 after he hears the rabbi
   translate the passage for an older student; specifically, the image of
   an angel holding a hot coal to Isaiah's lips and cleansing his sin.

   During the Passover holiday, David encounters some older truant
   children who force him to accompany them and drop a piece of zinc onto
   a live trolley-car rail. The electrical power released from this
   becomes associated in David's mind with the power of God and Isaiah's
   coal. Albert has taken a job as a milk delivery man. David,
   accompanying his father one day, sees Albert brutally whip a man who
   attempts to steal some of the milk bottles, possibly killing him.

   David meets and becomes infatuated with an older Catholic boy named
   Leo. Leo takes advantage of David's friendship and offers him a
   rosary--which David believes to have special powers of protection--in
   exchange for the chance to meet David's step-cousins, Polly and Esther.
   Leo takes Esther into the basement of the candy store and rapes her.

   David is thrown into an agitated state. He goes to Reb Yidel and
   fabricates a story, telling him that Genya is actually his aunt, his
   true mother is dead and that he is the son of her affair with the
   non-Jewish man. Polly tells Bertha and Nathan about what Leo did with
   Esther. As the rabbi goes to the Schearl household to inform Genya and
   Albert of what David told him, Bertha begs Nathan not to confront
   Albert about David's role in Leo's actions. Nathan goes anyway, but he
   fears Albert's wrath as well.

   After Reb Yidel relates David's story to Genya and Albert, David
   arrives at the apartment. Albert begins to reveal what he has suspected
   about David's birth. He tells Genya that their marriage is a sham,
   arranged to make one sin cover up the other--her affair, which was kept
   secret--against his sin, allowing his abusive father to be gored by a
   bull, widely known in the Galician village they left. Despite Genya's
   denials, Albert reaffirms his belief in his version of the story. He
   declares that David is not his son but the product of Genya's affair.

   At that moment, Nathan and Bertha arrive. Nathan hesitates at the
   moment of speaking his mind under Albert's cold fury. but David steps
   forward to confess to his parents of his part in what took place. He
   gives his father the whip that was used on the would-be milk thief. As
   Albert reaches the height of his enraged frenzy, he discovers the
   rosary that David possesses, believing it to be a sign that proves his
   suspicions. Albert makes as if to kill his son with the whip.

   As the others restrain Albert, David flees the apartment and returns to
   the electrified rail. This time, he touches the third rail with a long
   milk dipper in an attempt to create light and receives an enormous
   electric shock. Incapacitated, he is discovered by nearby tavern
   patrons, revived by an ambulance doctor and returned home by a
   policeman. When his parents are informed what happened, Albert appears
   remorseful and compassionate toward his son for the first time. As his
   mother takes him into her arms, David experiences a feeling such that
   "he might as well call it sleep".
