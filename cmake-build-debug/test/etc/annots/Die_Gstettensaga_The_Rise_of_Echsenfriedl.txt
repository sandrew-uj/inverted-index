   The growing tension between the last two remaining superpowers - China
   and Google - escalates in the early 21st century, and results in the
   global inferno of the "Google Wars". But as the decades go by,
   radioactive dust settles on old battlegrounds, and a New World rises
   from the ashes of the old.

   Fratt Aigner, a seedy journalist, and Alalia Grundschober, a nerdy
   technician, live and work in Mega City Schwechat: the biggest
   semi-urban sprawl in the foothills of what remained of the Alps.
   Thurnher von Pjoelk, who invented the printing press and runs the only
   newspaper around, feels threatened by the rise of a new generation of
   tech-savvy DIY nerds, who he fears will ruin his monopoly. He gives
   Alalia and Fratt the task to venture into the depths of Niederproell
   and conduct a tele-o-vision interview with Echsenfriedl; a mythical
   genius that has a large fan base among the nerds.

   Pjoelk sends off Alalia and Fratt equipped with a broadcasting vehicle
   (a wheelbarrow full of recording equipment) to live broadcast the
   interview with Echsenfriedl on tele-o-vision. Fratt is very skeptical
   of leaving the safety of the Mega City, but Alalia is a huge fan of
   Echsenfriedl and has investigated into his hiding place on earlier
   occasions. She sees this as a golden opportunity to find Echsenfriedl
   and boost her agenda of social change through technology.

   The road to finding Echsenfriedl is not an easy task and things start
   to go wrong as soon as they reach the border, which is protected by the
   Postal Service, who try to uphold civilization and fight
   structurelessness. The Postal Service confiscates their recording
   equipment and send Alalia and Fratt away in despair. They are abducted
   by a group of barbarians: descendants of farmers, in a cargo cult based
   on relics of office material, bureaucracy and vague memories of
   European Union agricultural grants. Alalia and Fratt have to blast
   their way out and manage to escape before they end up as a sacrifice.

   Aliana and Fratt wander the post-nuclear boondocks until they stumble
   upon a mining colony. They find shelter in a seemingly-abandoned
   underground structure, but discover a wondrous old lady, Philine-Codec
   Comtesse de Cybersdorf, who used to be married to Pjoelk until he tried
   to kill her in a rage, which ends in her losing a leg. She tells Aliana
   and Fratt that it was actually Echsenfriedl who was the re-inventor of
   the printing press, and he the creative brain behind Pjoelk's ideas and
   thoughts. Pjoelk was the man in public only because it was impossible
   for Echsenfriedl. The Comtesse is about to tell them crucial
   information about Echsenfriedl, but then cannibalizing undead striking
   miners invade the room and kill her before she gets the chance to
   reveal the truth.

   Having managed to escape the working-class zombie miners, they
   encounter the bearded libertarian drag queen Heinz Rand of Raika, who
   leads a group of tinsel-dressed free market enthusiasts living on
   trading useless pre-war electronics for more useless pre-war
   electronics. Alalia sees that Heinz has the equipment that the Postal
   Service took from them and she trades it back by helping the group to
   get their useless electronics working again. Having helped out Heinz,
   he then tells them where to find Echsenfriedl and even offers his
   daughter Ayn as a guide to the location.

   Alalia and Fratt, with the guidance of Ayn, finally reach their
   destination and prepare for the live broadcast. They contact Pjoelk,
   who happily commands them to begin the transmission, then he turns off
   his tele-o-visor and sits down in front of his typewriter to create the
   headline article for tomorrow's issue of his tabloid. He fabricates an
   entire story based on how he is distressed for being responsible for
   killing the nerd viewers, and where he makes a statement saying that
   there should be a law banning tele-o-vision forever. Not yet aware of
   the danger they are putting themselves in, Alalia and Fratt start
   broadcasting and begin their quest through the lair, following Ayn of
   Raika.

   On seeing Echsenfriedl, Ayn gets turned into stone: Echsenfriedl is a
   basilisk. Hiding behind a corner and out of view, Echsenfriedl tells
   Alalia and Fratt about his life. By dating the Comtesse, he upset his
   greedy partner Pjoelk. Pjoelk's sinister plan was to murder all the
   early adopters of tele-o-vision with a single broadcast of
   Echsenfriedl's deadly eyes. The nerds can hear the audio of this
   broadcast, and react with repulsion and anger, attacking Pjoelk's
   office. Echsenfriedl hires Alalia and Fratt as his crew to build a new
   media empire based on his marvelous new technologies. The films ends
   with Alalia and Fratt live broadcasting a lynch mob of book-burning
   nerds, who are the fervent supporters of Echsenfriedl's New World Order
   of technological dominance.
