   The story is told in first person, by a narrator who, it soon becomes
   clear, is Satan. He briefly recounts his history on Earth and tells how
   he directed people toward destructive activity, for instance by
   teaching them how to make gunpowder. Now the final war is over, and
   almost everyone has been killed. Satan comes across a man and a woman,
   the last survivors, who are inside a transparent dome that keeps out
   the contaminated air. The two people recognize Satan for who he is;
   Satan is troubled by their calm certitude, and asks about the elaborate
   machine that he sees inside their dome. He is told that it is a time
   machine, and that they are about to go "back to the beginning" to start
   over, this time without him:

     The woman said, "You've won Armageddon, but you've lost Earth."

     I knew the answer to that, of course, but she was a woman and had
     the last word.

     I gestured toward the purple darkness outside. "Lost Earth? What do
     you call this?"

     She poised her hand on the switch.

     "Hell," she said.

     And I have remembered her voice, through ten thousand lonely years.
