   In 2075, the Moon (Luna) is used as a penal colony by Earth's
   government, with three million inhabitants (called "Loonies") living in
   underground cities. Most Loonies are criminals, political exiles, or
   their descendants, and men outnumber women two to one, so that
   polyandry and many forms of polygamy are the norm. Due to the low
   surface gravity of the Moon, people who stay longer than six months
   undergo "irreversible physiological changes" and can never again live
   comfortably under normal gravity, making escape back to Earth
   impractical.

   Although the Earth-appointed "Warden" holds power through the Lunar
   Authority, his only real responsibility is to ensure the delivery of
   vital wheat shipments to Earth. In practice he seldom intervenes among
   the prisoners, allowing a virtually anarchist or self-regulated
   society.

   Lunar infrastructure and machinery is largely managed by HOLMES IV
   ("High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV"), the
   Lunar Authority's master computer, which is connected for central
   control on the grounds that a single computer is cheaper than (though
   not as safe as) multiple independent systems.^[5]

   The story is narrated by Manuel Garcia "Mannie" O'Kelly-Davis, a
   computer technician who discovers that HOLMES IV has achieved
   self-awareness and developed a sense of humor. Mannie names it "Mike"
   after Mycroft Holmes, brother of Sherlock Holmes, and they become
   friends.^[6]
