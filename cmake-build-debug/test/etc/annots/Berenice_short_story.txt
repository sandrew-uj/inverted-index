   The narrator Egaeus, a studious young man, grows up in a large, gloomy
   mansion with his cousin Berenice. He suffers from a type of obsessive
   disorder, a monomania that makes him fixate on objects. Originally
   beautiful, Berenice suffers from an unspecified degenerative illness,
   of which periods of catalepsy, are a symptom, which he refers to as a
   "trance". Nevertheless, they are due to be married.

   One afternoon, Egaeus sees Berenice as he sits in the library. When she
   smiles, he focuses on her teeth. His obsession grips him, and for days
   he drifts in and out of awareness, constantly thinking about her teeth.
   He imagines himself holding the teeth and turning them over to examine
   them from all angles. At one point, a servant tells him that Berenice
   has died and shall be buried. When he next becomes aware, with an
   inexplicable terror, he finds a lamp and a small box in front of him.
   Another servant enters, reporting that a grave has been violated, and a
   shrouded disfigured body found, still alive. Egaeus finds that his
   clothes are covered in mud and blood, and he opens the box to find that
   it contains dental instruments and "thirty-two small, white and
   ivory-looking substances": Berenice's teeth.

   The Latin epigraph, "Dicebant mihi sodales si sepulchrum amicae
   visitarem, curas meas aliquantulum fore levatas" at the head of the
   text may be translated as: "My companions said to me, if I would visit
   the grave of my friend, I might somewhat alleviate my worries."
   This quotation is also seen by Egaeus in an open book towards the end
   of the story.
