   About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic
   factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for
   future settlement. One of those factory ships suffers severe radiation
   damage from a near-miss by a supernova and goes off course, drifting in
   space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon
   Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing
   imperfect copies that begin to evolve on their own. (The description of
   this background is presented in a prologue^[1] that proved sufficiently
   popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a
   collection of Hogan's short fiction.)^[2] The resulting machine
   ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like
   intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of
   Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a
   being they call the "Lifemaker".

   Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization
   (combining NASA and NATO) dispatched the Orion with a cover story of
   terraforming Mars for human habitation. Karl Zambendorf, a con artist
   who is present on this expedition to verify ESP over interplanetary
   distances, prematurely learns that the Orion and its crew of
   researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has
   been kept need-to-know on Earth.

   When the Orion arrives, the first landing party sets down in a
   freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home
   state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because
   they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to
   Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the
   humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother
   Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf
   intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a prophet.

   Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources
   and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to
   slaves. The NASO business administrators on the Orion are already in
   agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call
   humans "Lumians" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision)
   weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed
   by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his
   unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork
   guidelines akin to the Ten Commandments for his people to prevent a war
   from starting. "All Taloids are brothers" and "No Taloid is to enslave
   or be a slave" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of
   Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the Orion crew not working for NASO.
   There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between
   humans and Taloids will be one of equals.
