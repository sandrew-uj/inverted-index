   For his seventh birthday, Joe receives a mysterious blue book (known
   only as "The Book") from his magician uncle and namesake, "Joe the
   Magnificent". Using a number of often unpredictable and/or
   unintentional voice and print cues, The Book frequently transports Joe
   and his friends, Fred and Sam, to a variety of different times and
   places, from Camelot's medieval court of knights and dragons to the
   year 2095, where they meet their own great-granddaughters. The only way
   they are able to return to present-day Brooklyn, New York is to find
   The Book again within whatever time period they are in. Anna, Joe's
   sister, is also always eager to have the book (which is quite annoying
   to Joe). During their travels, Joe and his friends learn that The Book
   will eventually be inherited by Joe's great-granddaughter, Jodie, who
   time travels with The Book with her friends who are Sam and Fred's
   great-granddaughters, Samantha and Freddi, and occasionally save the
   boys from trouble when their paths cross or come to visit. The Time
   Warp Trio faces many challenges during their travels and their learning
   of how to use The Book.
