   Marco Fogg is an orphan and his Uncle Victor his only caretaker. Fogg
   starts college, and nine months later moves from the dormitory into his
   own apartment furnished with 1492 books given to him by Uncle Victor.
   Uncle Victor dies before Fogg finishes college and leaves him without
   friends and family. Marco inherits some money which he uses to pay for
   Uncle Victor's funeral. He becomes an introvert, spends his time
   reading, and thinks, "Why should I get a job? I have enough to do
   living through the days." After selling the books one by one in order
   to survive Fogg loses his apartment and seeks shelter in Central Park.
   He meets Kitty Wu and begins a romance with her after he has been
   rescued from Central Park by Zimmer and Kitty Wu. Eventually he finds a
   job taking care of Thomas Effing.

   Fogg learns about the complicated history of his parents, and Effings'
   previous identity as the painter Julian Barber. When Effing dies,
   leaving money to Fogg, Marco and Kitty Wu set up a house together in
   Chinatown. After an abortion Fogg breaks up with Kitty Wu and travels
   across the U.S. to search for himself. He begins his journey with his
   father Solomon Barber, who dies shortly after an accident at Westlawn
   Cemetery, where Fogg's mother is buried. Marco continues his journey
   alone, which ends on a lonely California beach: "This is where I start,
   ... this is where my life begins."
