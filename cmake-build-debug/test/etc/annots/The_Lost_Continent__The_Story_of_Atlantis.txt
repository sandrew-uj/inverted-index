   The novel uses the common nineteenth-century device of a "framing
   story" to set its narrative in context and augment its believability.
   The story proper was written supposedly by Deucalion, a warrior-priest
   of ancient Atlantis; the text having been partly destroyed
   inadvertently by one of its discoverers at the time of its finding, it
   is not entirely complete. Deucalion's account describes his heroic but
   ultimately doomed battle to save Atlantis from destruction by its
   avaricious and selfish empress, Phorenice.
