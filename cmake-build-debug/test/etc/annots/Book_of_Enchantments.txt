   The book collects ten fantasy stories by Wrede, together with a recipe
   associated with one of the stories and notes by the author concerning
   the inspiration of some of the stories. Two of the tales are set in the
   shared worlds of Will Shetterley and Emma Bull's Liavek ("Rikiki and
   the Wizard") and Andre Norton's Witch World ("The Sword-Seller"). Two
   stories ("The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn" and "Utensile
   Strength") are set in the world of Wrede's own Enchanted Forest
   Chronicles. Two ("Stronger than Time" and "The Lorelei") are
   retellings, or alternate versions of traditional fairy or folk tales.
   One ("Cruel Sisters") is based on a folk song, a variant of The Twa
   Sisters, that Wrede once heard performed by Loreena McKennitt as The
   Bonny Swans. McKennitt's change to a particular line ("and he had
   daughters, one, two three...") inspired Wrede to write the story from
   the third daughter's point of view.
