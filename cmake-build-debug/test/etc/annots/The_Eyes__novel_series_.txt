   The Eyes was a series of science fiction novels written in the 1970s by
   Richard Gordon under the pen name Stuart Gordon.

   The series is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the same nature was
   torn and mutated. The origin of the catastrophe is uncertain, due to
   the passing of centuries and to the sheer scale of destruction it
   unleashed upon the land. In book two it is hinted that the original
   cause might be a large-scale nuclear war or a cometary impact. The plot
   revolves around a mutant child with god-like powers called the Divine
   Mutant, the reincarnation of a former mutant king born one thousand
   years before, shortly after the catastrophe, who is determined to
   spread chaos in the slowly rebuilding world. Most of the events are
   seen through the eyes of a group of people involved in his schemes.
