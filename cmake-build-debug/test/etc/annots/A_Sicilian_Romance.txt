   The plot concerns the fallen nobility of the house of Mazzini, on the
   northern shore of Sicily, as related by a tourist who learns of their
   turbulent history from a monk he meets at the ruins of their
   once-magnificent castle.

   The Marquis Mazzini's daughters, Emilia and Julia, are beautiful and
   accomplished young ladies. Julia quickly falls in love with the young
   and handsome Italian count Hippolitus de Vereza, but to her dismay her
   father decides that she should marry Duke de Luovo instead. After much
   thought Julia attempts to elope with Hippolitus on the night before her
   wedding. However, their escape has been anticipated, and the Marquis
   ambushes and seemingly kills Hippolitus, whose body is carried away by
   his servants. He insists that Julia to accept the engagement with de
   Luovo, but after much difficulty she escapes again alone.

   Mazzini and De Luovo spend much of the novel trying to catch Julia, who
   has to flee from her various hiding places as she narrowly avoids
   capture and eventually ends up, by a secret tunnel, in the abandoned
   and seemingly haunted southern apartments of the Mazzini castle. There
   she finds that her mother, thought to be dead, has instead been
   imprisoned there for years by the Marquis, who had grown to despise
   her. The Marquis's new wife, Maria de Vellorno, is discovered and
   accused of infidelity by her husband, therefore she poisons the Marquis
   and stabs herself. Before he dies, the Marquis confesses to Ferdinand,
   his son, that his mother has been imprisoned, and hands him the keys.
   However, his mother and Julia have already been freed by Hippolitus,
   who had recovered from his wounds. Ferdinand then finds them at a
   lighthouse on the coast, waiting to leave for Italy, and they are all
   joyfully reunited.
