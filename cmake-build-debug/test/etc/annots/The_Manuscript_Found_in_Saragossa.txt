   The Manuscript Found in Saragossa collects intertwining stories, all of
   them set in whole or in part in Spain, with a large and colorful cast
   of Romani, thieves, inquisitors, a cabbalist, a geometer, the
   cabbalist's beautiful sister, two Moorish princesses (Emina and
   Zubeida) and others that the brave, perhaps foolhardy, Walloon Guard
   Alphonse van Worden meets, imagines or reads about in the Sierra Morena
   mountains of 18th-century Spain while en route to Madrid. Recounted to
   the narrator over the course of sixty-six days, the novel's stories
   quickly overshadow van Worden's frame story. The bulk of the stories
   revolve around the Gypsy chief Avadoro, whose story becomes a frame
   story itself. Eventually the narrative focus moves again toward van
   Worden's frame story and a conspiracy involving an underground -- or
   perhaps entirely hallucinated -- Muslim society, revealing the
   connections and correspondences between the hundred or so stories told
   over the novel's sixty-six days.

   The stories cover a wide range of genres and subjects, including the
   gothic, the picaresque, the erotic, the historical, the moral and the
   philosophic; and as a whole, the novel reflects Potocki's far-ranging
   interests, especially his deep fascination with secret societies, the
   supernatural and "Oriental" cultures. The novel's
   stories-within-stories sometimes reach several levels of depth, and
   characters and themes -- a few prominent themes being honor, disguise,
   metamorphosis and conspiracy -- recur and change shape throughout.
   Because of its rich and varied interlocking structure, the novel echoes
   favorable comparison to many celebrated literary antecedents such as
   the ancient BCE Jatakas and Panchatantra as well as the medieval
   Arabian Nights and Decameron.
