   Kirth Gersen is on Alphanor with Alusz Iphigenia Eperje-Tokay, a woman
   he had rescued in the previous novel of the series. It is plain that
   their short-lived relationship is nearing an end, as she cannot
   understand why Gersen, made extremely wealthy by his epic defrauding of
   Interchange, still feels the need to exterminate the remaining Demon
   Princes who killed his family himself, instead of hiring assassins.
   Most of all, she cannot accept his cold and obsessive pursuit of
   vengeance.

   Gersen notices a newspaper article announcing the forthcoming execution
   of a prominent Sarkoy venefice (poison maker), Kakarsis Asm, not for
   selling poisons to the Demon Prince, Viole Falushe, but for selling
   below a Guild-mandated price floor. He accordingly hastens to Sarkovy,
   a planet famous for its poisons, to meet Asm before it is too late.

   There he learns from Kakarsis Asm (in exchange for bribing his way to a
   swift and painless execution) that Falushe visited Sarkovy, at the
   beginning of his criminal career many years before, with a shipload of
   slaves, two female slaves of whom he sold to Asm and whom Asm
   subsequently resold. While they are on Sarkovy, Gersen's relationship
   with Alusz Iphigenia finally ends, though he ensures that she will be
   financially supported.

   After visiting his new financial advisor, the brilliant economist Jehan
   Addels, to check how the program to invest the proceeds of his swindle
   is proceeding, Gersen locates a surviving slave, whom he buys and frees
   in exchange for further information concerning his enemy. He learns
   that Falushe was born Vogel Filschner, an Earth boy of disgusting
   appearance and habits who, to satisfy his obsession with a female
   classmate, Jheral Tinzy, had kidnapped the entire girls' choral society
   at his school. But Jheral had not attended choir practice that day.

   Gersen follows the trail to "Rolingshaven" in the Netherlands, to the
   people who knew Filschner as a youth. The most direct link is the mad
   poet Navarth, a flamboyant genius who was Filschner's mentor and who
   later enjoyed a brief relationship with Jheral. After the kidnapping,
   she had attracted a share of the blame for having teased and flirted
   with Filschner and turned to Navarth for comfort. However, she was
   later abducted by Falushe. Navarth has custody of an 18-year-old girl,
   variously known as Drusilla Wayles or "Zan Zu from Eridu," who was
   given to him as a child by Falushe to nurture and protect. She
   resembles the young Jheral to a disturbing extent.

   With the erratic assistance of Navarth, Gersen tries to engineer a
   meeting with Falushe. To this end, he buys the failing, but respected
   Cosmopolis magazine, appoints himself as a journalist, and authors a
   lurid article that paints the young Falushe in extremely unflattering
   terms. He is able, through Navarth, to contact Falushe by telephone and
   secures an invitation to Falushe's legendary Palace of Love, a
   hedonistic playground, in his guise as a reporter in return for writing
   a more flattering article.

   He is transported to Falushe's planet, where he sees that the Demon
   Prince has built an entire civilization acknowledging him as its
   supreme ruler. The female inhabitants pay "tax" to him by working in
   state brothels and by giving their first-born children to him (the most
   beautiful going to staff the Palace, the others sold as slaves). In the
   company of a party of invitees including Navarth, Gersen visits the
   luxurious Palace. Eventually, he discovers Falushe's lifelong ambition:
   to create a copy of Jheral Tinzy who will be brainwashed into loving
   him. Navarth's Drusilla Wayles was bred parthenogenically from the
   original Jheral, and there are at least two others on the planet.
   Jheral herself died by suicide some years into the forced breeding
   program.

   Gersen, guessing correctly that Viole Falushe is among the guests in
   disguise, so that Viole can try to win Drusilla's affections, narrows
   the possibilities down to three men and finally identifies his prey
   with the aid of a critical error by Falushe: he has an implanted in-ear
   telephone, which can be heard quietly ringing when Navarth calls him.
   By this time, Gersen has rescued two women who are imprisoned as Jheral
   copies and, along with Drusilla Wayles, they leave no doubt that they
   find Falushe repellent. The Demon Prince bitterly realizes that his
   life's work has been an abject failure. As Gersen is about to throw him
   out of an airboat hovering ten thousand feet above the sea, Falushe
   breaks his bonds, but loses his balance and falls to his doom.

   Gersen frees the enslaved servants at the Palace, informs the planet's
   inhabitants that they need pay "taxes" no more, and entrusts the
   various Drusillas to Navarth's eccentric care. Some months later, he
   happens to meet yet another, more mature Drusilla, plainly the oldest,
   and is about to read her some of Navarth's poetry as the story closes.
