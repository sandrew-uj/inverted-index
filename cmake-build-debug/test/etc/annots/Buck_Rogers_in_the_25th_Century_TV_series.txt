   The theatrical film also served as a pilot and two-part first episode
   for the series, entitled "Awakening". Several scenes were edited, some
   to remove the more adult dialogue in the film, including when Buck
   refers to Wilma as "ballsy", and later when he says "shit", and a scene
   in which Buck kills Ardala's henchman, Tiger Man, was edited to allow
   the character to return in later episodes. Also, some new and
   extended scenes were added for the TV version, including several scenes
   within Buck's new apartment, which was the setting for a new final
   scene in which Dr. Huer and Wilma try to persuade Buck to join the
   Defense Directorate. This scene ends with Buck actually declining their
   offer, though he opts to join them in an unofficial capacity by the
   first episode of the series proper, "Planet of the Slave Girls". In
   this unofficial role, Buck does everything from acting as a covert
   agent on various undercover assignments to assisting Wilma as a
   flight/combat instructor. Buck is, most often, partnered with Wilma,
   with whom he often shares a flirtatious relationship.

   Including the two-part pilot episode, the first season comprised 24
   episodes, with four of the stories being two-parters. The tone of the
   series was lighter than the pilot movie, and showed a more positive
   picture of future Earth. The Inner City was now known as New Chicago,
   and human civilization was established as having spread once again
   across the planet, and also to the stars. After the movie pilot, no
   reference to barren radioactive wastelands was made, and in several
   episodes, the world outside is shown as lush and green. The mutants
   seen in the pilot film were no longer seen, and Buck sometimes ventured
   outside New Chicago with no hazards encountered. As opposed to the
   isolationist planet seen in the film, Earth no longer has an invisible
   defense shield surrounding it and is shown to be the center of an
   interstellar, human-dominated government, sometimes called "the
   Federation" or "the Alliance", with its capital at New Chicago. During
   the first season, references were also made to other "new" Earth cities
   such as New Detroit, New Manhattan, New Phoenix, New Tulsa, Boston
   Complex, and New London. A "City-on-the-Sea" was also seen, mentioned
   as being the former New Orleans.

   Wilma Deering and Dr. Huer were the only Defense Directorate personnel
   seen in every episode, though several others were seen in individual
   episodes. Most Defense Directorate personnel regard Buck as being at
   least an "honorary" captain, in reference to his 20th-century U.S.
   military rank, but his membership in Earth's defense forces is
   unofficial. Nevertheless, Buck often flies with the fighter squadrons,
   and uses his 20th-century U.S. Air Force background to assist in their
   training. Dr. Huer regularly meets, greets, and otherwise deals with
   representatives of other sovereign powers. Huer was also seen in
   military uniform (at formal occasions), thus indicating he is or was a
   member of the military.

   Travel between the stars was accomplished with the use of "stargates" -
   artificially created portals in space (similar in appearance to
   wormholes), but referred to as "warp" travel on at least one occasion
   by Wilma Deering. Stargates appear as a diamond-shaped quartet of
   brilliant lights in space that shimmer when a vessel is making transit.
   Some people find the transit through a stargate to be physically
   unpleasant (transit resembling a "spinning" of the spacecraft). Buck's
   dislike of them is shown in part one of the episode "Planet of the
   Slave Girls" and again in part two of the episode "The Plot to Kill a
   City".

   To portray futuristic-looking buildings on Earth, the show used stock
   shots of the remaining national pavilions of Expo 67, particularly the
   French and British pavilions, as well as shots of the Bonaventure Hotel
   in downtown Los Angeles.

   Juanin Clay, who played Major Marla Landers in the first-season episode
   "Vegas in Space", was originally cast as Wilma for the TV series (Erin
   Gray had initially opted not to return after the pilot film, but she
   later changed her mind). Wilma's personality was softened considerably
   in the series. While she was still seen as a strong, confident and
   consummate professional in her work, she had a much more relaxed
   attitude and a warmer relationship with Buck. A potentially romantic
   relationship between Buck and Wilma was hinted at, but rarely expanded
   upon, and in the first season, Buck was involved (to some degree) with
   a different woman almost every week. Producers demanded that Wilma have
   blonde hair, so dye jobs were needed to lighten Erin Gray's brunette
   locks. During the final episodes of the first season, Gray was allowed
   to return to her natural hair color, and Wilma was dark-haired
   throughout season two. Buck's best-known enemy during the first season
   was Princess Ardala, played by Pamela Hensley, whose desire was to
   conquer and possess both Earth and Buck himself. She appeared in four
   separate stories, including the pilot film, two single episodes
   ("Escape from Wedded Bliss" and "Ardala Returns"), and the two-part
   first-season finale ("Flight of the War Witch").

   The opening title sequence for the series included stock footage from
   the Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 launches.

   The series had an overall budget of $800,000 per hour of air time,
   according to Starlog issue #32 (March 1980). Former actor Jock
   Gaynor served as producer for 20 episodes. Although reasonably popular
   with viewers, the first season failed to receive much critical acclaim.
   One vocal critic of the series was Gerard himself, who pushed for more
   serious storytelling and often clashed with the producers and the
   network (NBC) over the show's tone and handling. He often arbitrarily
   refused to perform some of the more comical lines in the scripts he was
   given, complaining that Buck was just a "wise-ass" who was making one
   joke after another, and often rewrote scripts himself to place more
   emphasis on his own character at the expense of others (for example, in
   the episode "Escape From Wedded Bliss", the script originally called
   for Buck to be rescued from the Draconians at the end by Wilma, but
   Gerard vetoed the idea). Unhappy with the show's direction, Gerard
   became increasingly difficult to work with, which led to tensions on
   set. A meeting between writers/script editors Anne Collins and Alan
   Brennert and him went badly, and they quit the show midway through the
   first season. Gerard himself was threatened with legal action by the
   network if he continued to cause problems and hinder the production. In
   the November 1980 issue of Starlog, Gerard even said he had hoped the
   series would not be picked up for a second season because he had no
   wish to go through another season like the first one.
