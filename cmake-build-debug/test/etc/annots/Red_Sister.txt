   The planet Abeth was originally settled by four tribes with various
   abilities. The hunska have superhuman speed; the gerant have superhuman
   strength, the marjal can work elemental magic; the quantal can work
   larger magics. Children born on Abeth may have access to one (or
   rarely, multiple) bloodline powers. Abeth's dying red giant sun cannot
   generate sufficient heat to prevent a global ice age. Abeth's man-made
   moon refracts sunlight onto a narrow strip of land circling the globe.
   This Corridor, only fifty miles wide, is the only unfrozen land on the
   planet. It comprises several kingdoms fighting for control of the
   planet's resources.

   Nona Grey is a peasant girl living in a remote village in the Corridor.
   She is purchased by a slave trader who recognizes that she has hunska
   blood. She is brought to the capital of the Empire, where she attacks a
   noble named Raymel Tacsis. She is saved from execution by Abbess Glass
   of the Sweet Mercy Convent.

   Nona trains in the arts of combat and subterfuge at Sweet Mercy. Along
   the way, she meets fellow novice Arabella (Ara). Various nobles believe
   that Ara is the Argatha, a savior destined to save Abeth. Abbess Glass
   convinces the nobility that Nona is the Shield, destined to protect the
   Argatha. With her training, Nona recognizes that she also has quantal
   and marjal talents. Nona also meets a mysterious student named Zole and
   her bodyguard Yisht. Nona realizes that Yisht is attempting to steal a
   valuable artifact from Sweet Mercy: the shipheart, which was left by
   the original settlers of Abeth. With four shiphearts, one can control
   the moon which is protecting Abeth from a permanent ice age. Nona and
   the other students defeat Yisht and save the shipheart.

   In a frame story, an adult Nona and Ara are attacked by members of the
   Empire's nobility. They are betrayed by Clera, a former student at
   Sweet Mercy. Nona attempts to convince Clera to join them against the
   Empire's army.
