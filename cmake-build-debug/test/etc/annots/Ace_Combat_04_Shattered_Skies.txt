   The game is set in the alternate universe of Strangereal where Earth as
   a planet exists but has several differences in landmass and history.
   Five years prior to the events of the game, a massive asteroid,
   designated Ulysses 1994XF04, collided with Earth in a disastrous impact
   event. Before the impact, the nations on the continent of Usea
   developed an array of anti-asteroid railguns code-named "Stonehenge" to
   destroy the asteroid's fragments, but they could not completely prevent
   the disaster, which killed hundreds of thousands of people. The
   devastation shattered the economy of Erusea, one of Usea's largest
   countries, causing a refugee crisis that led to heightened tensions
   with its neighbors. As a result, Erusea's military launched a surprise
   invasion of San Salvacion, its closest neighbor, and captured the
   Stonehenge facility, resulting in all-out war between Erusea and the
   other Usean nations. The Usean nations in opposition to Erusea formed a
   military defense coalition known as the Independent State Allied Forces
   (ISAF), but the Eruseans used Stonehenge as an anti-aircraft weapon to
   decimate the ISAF's airpower, routing the ISAF and forcing them to
   retreat to the island of North Point off the northeastern coast of the
   continent, outside of Stonehenge's effective radius.
