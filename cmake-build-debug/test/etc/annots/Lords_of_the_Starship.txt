   In the far future, on an Earth devastated by millennia of war, the
   Caroline Republic is hostile towards its neighbors despite sharing
   their dire economic straits. Outside the declining remains of
   civilization lie ruins and wastelands populated by mutants and
   monsters. It is generally felt that humanity lost its vitality long
   ago.

   To a leading politician of the Caroline the aged veteran General
   Toriman proposes a centuries-long scheme to build the nation by taking
   control of an ancient shipyard hundreds of miles away which was
   apparently designed to build spacecraft. Ostensibly, the purpose of the
   project will be the construction of a spaceship seven miles long called
   the "Victory" to carry the population of the despairing world to a
   paradise planet called "Home". In fact, the ship will never be
   completed, but the effort will revitalize the nation's economy and
   perhaps restore mankind's missing quality.

   General Toriman dies and the cynical politicians of the Republic rouse
   the population to begin the project. The River Road from the Caroline
   homeland to the Yards is forced with a bloody battle between a Caroline
   military force and mutants, during which the ghost of the ancient hero
   Miolnor IV appears to save the day.

   Work begins on constructing the ship. Despite their antiquity, the
   Yards' machinery and buildings seem to have been perfectly preserved
   and materials for the construction of the ship are discovered. Legends
   say that the fortifications still standing nearby defended human
   civilization against Dark Powers over the mountains to the west.

   The magnificent city of Gateway grows in the hills above the Yards
   while the Victory slowly takes shape. Much of the population of the
   Caroline moves to the Yards and its society is formally divided into
   two classes. The Technos supervise construction and are aware of the
   motivational "myth of the ship" plan while the People believe that the
   voyage to the planet Home is the actual goal.

   Some Technos realize that, although Gateway has become rich and
   prosperous through the Victory project, the Caroline homeland is still
   as miserable as its neighbors. Before they can act on this knowledge
   the People revolt, led by a man named Coral who claims truthfully that
   the Technos have lied and do not intend to complete the Victory. Most
   of the Technos are killed although one is allowed to bring the news to
   the Dresau Islands in the eastern sea. The Dresau Navy has a proud
   tradition as the last surviving remnant of vital humanity and its
   leader believes the Victory project has a sinister purpose, possibly
   directed by heirs of the dark power Salasar, which once ruled most of
   the earth.

   After almost two centuries of construction, the Victory is completed
   and the women and children of the People are placed aboard in suspended
   animation. Led by the Dresau Navy the gathered enemies of Coral's
   triumphant People attack with their restored ships and scavenged
   weapons. The defenses of the Caroline Empire are ineffective, and an
   apocalyptic battle rages about the Yards, with millions fighting. At
   the height of the battle the sea turns red with blood and the dead of
   past wars rise in support of the assault. The legendary fortresses fire
   missiles toward the west.

   Before any of the men of the People board the Victory it moves down the
   ways to the sea. It turns its huge engines toward the shore and they
   ignite, incinerating the fighting armies, ships, Yards, and Gateway.
   The Victory then redirects the destruction onto itself and its millions
   of passengers. Balls of fire arrive over the mountains to complete the
   destruction.

   When the wreckage of the Yards has cooled, the man who has been called
   General Toriman, the ghost of Miolnor IV, and Coral arrives. The
   Victory project and its opposition have been devised by the heirs of
   Salasar. He signals the completion of the project; the military powers
   of the east have been destroyed and invasion by those in the west can
   begin.
