   Jerry Morgan, a man with no future on Earth, is offered a new life on
   Mars. He starts out on the wrong foot, meeting a princess and killing
   the fearsome-looking Martian beast he takes to be menacing her, which
   actually turns out to be her pet. From there Morgan becomes entangled
   in the politics of the Byzantine Martian royal court, spurns the
   advances of a would-be lover, escapes his hosts and role as an
   expendable political pawn. Various adventures follow, with dazzling
   swordplay, feats of strength, and other trials, tribulations and
   treacheries.

   Kline's Mars has multiple parallel canals, surrounded by walls and
   terraces, and the construction of the canals by Martian machines is
   described. The story has a race-war element that may jar the modern
   reader.
