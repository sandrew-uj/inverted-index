   Morton Cargill, Korean War soldier, accidentally kills a girl named
   Marie while driving drunk. He runs from the scene. A year later, he
   gets a letter from the girl asking to meet him. But this is not Marie,
   but a remote descendant from the future, who is suffering an inherited
   form of neurosis which time travelers, called 'The Shadows', have
   traced back to his negligent crime. The only therapy to cure her is if
   she witnesses him being murdered. He then wakes 400 years into the
   future, to the Shadow City to be executed.

   He escapes, with help from Ann Reece, who represents a group called
   'Tweeners', who are organized by a Shadow named Grannis. Grannis is
   apparently a traitor to the Shadows and wishes the Tweeners to attack
   and destroy the Shadow City. Cargill is overcome by suspicions against
   the Tweeners, so during his rescue he escapes into the woods where he
   is immediately captured. His captors this time are futuristic nomads or
   'trailer trash' called 'Planiacs' who live in floating airships.

   The Planiacs have rejected civilization and its intolerable
   psychological pressures. Their airships are stocked and repaired by the
   Shadows, and they live utterly purposeless lives floating from place to
   place, occasionally stopping to fish.

   Grannis the Shadow shows up among the Planiacs, apparently to seize
   Cargill. Cargill escapes by seducing his jailer's daughter, Lela
   Bouvey, and stealing an airship. He spends several months as a nomad,
   and begins to organize a political revolution among them, but is
   recaptured by the Shadows, and sent back in time to the same night he
   escaped.

   Ann Reece, the Tweener agent, again frees him, brings him to their
   city, where he is hypnotically programmed. He has no choice but to
   carry out his mission, to enter the Shadow city and shut off its
   defensive energy field, so that an air raid might destroy the Shadows.

   The Tweeners are those Planiacs who attempted to join the Shadows, but
   could not pass their tests. They plan to destroy the Shadows and force
   the Planiacs out of their nomadic existence and back to earthbound
   labor.

   Cargill has several dreams where is encounters beings from previous or
   future eons, which convinces him that the fate of the universe hangs in
   the success or failure of the Shadow-Tweener war.

   As a delaying tactic, he advises the Tweeners how to reorganize their
   air force to make a successful raid, he again seduces his jailer (which
   this time is Ann Reece), and he again begins to organize a political
   revolt among his captors, hoping an uprising of peacelovers among the
   Tweeners will stop the coming attack.

   Now firmly convinced that the Shadows are innocent, and that the
   planned Tweener attack is wrong, Cargill is unable to halt or even
   hinder the hypnotic programming that forces him to enter the Shadow
   City.

   The Shadows are superhumans able to travel through time, walk through
   walls, and revive the dead. Once in the city, Cargill is given the
   Shadow training, which consists of a single lecture hypnotically
   imprinted on his brain. Now armed with all their powers and abilities,
   Cargill emerges from the training session to witness a celebration of
   the election results: the Shadows elect their leaders retroactively
   through time, voting only after the leader's term of office is up, and
   reporting it back through time to themselves on election day. To his
   surprise and dread, Cargill finds he is the new leader.

   The leader of the Shadows is Grannis; Cargill himself is Grannis. He
   spends the last chapter of the book traveling back through time to
   organize the various pointless conspiracies among the Tweeners and
   Planiacs which brought him here. While being killed and raised from the
   dead, he recalls that he and all other participants in the life-force
   of the cosmos created the universe as a game, and became bound to it,
   and to its tragedies, due to their psychological limitations: greed
   creates time, the desire for revenge creates death, and so on.
   Cargill-Grannis discovers he is innocent of the original death of
   Marie, but now he must arrange that death in order to prevent a time
   paradox which would otherwise destroy the universe.
