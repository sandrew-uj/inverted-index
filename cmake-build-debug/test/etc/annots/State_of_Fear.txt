   Peter Evans is a lawyer for a millionaire philanthropist, George
   Morton. Evans' main duties are managing the legal affairs surrounding
   Morton's contributions to an environmentalist organization, the
   National Environmental Resource Fund (NERF) (modeled after the Natural
   Resources Defense Council [NRDC]).^[7]

   Morton becomes suspicious of NERF's director, Nicholas Drake, after
   discovering that Drake has misused some of the funds Morton had donated
   to the group. Soon afterward, Morton is visited by two men, John Kenner
   and Sanjong Thapa, who appear on the surface to be researchers at MIT,
   but, in fact, are international law enforcement agents on the trail of
   an eco-terrorist group, the Environmental Liberation Front (ELF)
   (modeled on the Earth Liberation Front). The ELF is attempting to
   create "natural" disasters to convince the public of the dangers of
   global warming. All these events are timed to happen during a
   NERF-sponsored climate conference that will highlight the "catastrophe"
   of global warming. The eco-terrorists have no qualms about how many
   people are killed in their manufactured "natural" disasters and
   ruthlessly assassinate anyone who gets in their way (few would
   recognize their preferred methods as murder: the venom of a rare
   Australian blue-ringed octopus which causes paralysis, and "lightning
   attractors" which cause their victims to get electrocuted during
   electrical storms). Kenner and Thapa suspect Drake of being involved
   with the ELF to further his own ends (garnering more donations to NERF
   from the environmentally-minded public).

   Evans joins Kenner, Thapa, and Morton's assistant, Sarah Jones, on a
   globe-spanning series of adventures to thwart various ELF-manufactured
   disasters before these disasters kill thousands of people. Kenner's
   niece, Jennifer Haynes, joins the group for the final leg as they
   travel to a remote island in the Solomon Islands to stop the ELF's
   piece de resistance, a tsunami that will inundate the California
   coastline just as Drake is winding up the international conference on
   the "catastrophe" of global warming. Along the way, the group battles
   man-eating crocodiles and cannibalistic tribesmen (who feast on Ted
   Bradley, an environmentalist TV actor whom Drake had sent to spy on
   Kenner and his team). The rest of the group is rescued in the nick of
   time by Morton, who had previously faked his own death to throw Drake
   off the trail so that he could keep watch on the ELF's activities on
   the island while he waited for Kenner and his team to arrive.

   The group has a final confrontation with the elite ELF team on the
   island during which Haynes is almost killed, and Evans kills one of the
   terrorists who had previously tried to kill both him and Jones in
   Antarctica. The rest of the ELF team is killed by the backwash from
   their own tsunami, which Kenner and his team have sabotaged just enough
   to prevent it from becoming a full-size tsunami and reaching
   California.

   Morton, Evans, and Jones return to Los Angeles. Evans quits his law
   firm to work for Morton's new, as yet unnamed, organization, which will
   practice environmental activism as a business, free from potential
   conflicts of interest. Morton hopes Evans and Jones will take his place
   in the new organization after his death.
