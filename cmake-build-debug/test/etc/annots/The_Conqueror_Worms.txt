   Teddy Garnett, an older man and war veteran, tells this story of a
   global flood that has left humanity in tatters. Holed up in his
   mountain home in West Virginia, Teddy and his buddy, Carl Seaton,
   struggle through daily life, puzzling over things even stranger than a
   40-day rainstorm, including the giant slime-coated holes that keep
   showing up in Teddy's yard and the giant worm-like creature that ate a
   robin outside of Teddy's window. Meanwhile, Teddy is reeling over the
   loss of his wife Rose and the mysterious fate of his children and
   grandchildren.

   Before long, Teddy and Carl are fending off man-eating earthworms the
   size of buses. A helicopter crash nearby brings Kevin and Sarah, the
   last two survivors of an outpost in Baltimore, into Teddy's story;
   their tale makes up the bizarre second part of the book that explores
   the insanity doom can inspire. Kevin serves as the narrator for this
   tale and he tells about how he and a group of survivors faced off
   against all kinds of terror in Baltimore, including Satanists who make
   sacrifices to a mysterious beast known as Leviathan.

   It all leads to a showdown back at Teddy's house with a creature so
   monstrous it scares even the killer earthworms.
