   The story starts with a prologue, telling the tale of young British
   aristocrat, Richard Devine, who is the son of a shipbuilding magnate,
   Sir Richard Devine. In an incidence of domestic violence, Richard's
   mother reveals to Sir Richard that his son was fathered by another man,
   Lord Bellasis. Sir Richard proceeds to threaten the mother's reputation
   if Richard does not leave and never come back. He leaves him to pack
   for a while, claiming that he will fetch his lawyer to alter his will
   so that Richard receives no inheritance. When Richard leaves, he comes
   across a murder scene: his biological father, Lord Bellasis has been
   murdered, and Richard witnesses Sir Richard walking away from the scene
   of the crime. The police come and lock up Richard, who now gives his
   name as Rufus Dawes (which is used for the remainder of the book), for
   the murder of Lord Bellasis. Additionally, Sir Richard returns home and
   dies straight away, possibly of a heart-attack, without altering his
   will. Rufus Dawes/Richard Devine never finds this out. Rufus is found
   not guilty of the murder but guilty of the robbery of the corpse and
   sentenced to transportation to the penal colony of Australia.

   In 1827, Dawes is shipped to Van Diemen's Land on the Malabar, which
   also carries Captain Vickers, who is to become the new commander of the
   penal settlement at Macquarie Harbour, his wife Julia and child Sylvia,
   Julia's maid, one Sarah Purfoy and Lieutenant Maurice Frere, Richard
   Devine's cousin, son of Sir Richard's sister, who would have inherited
   the fortune in Richard's place. It turns out that Sarah is on the
   vessel only to free her lover, John Rex. She organises a mutiny with
   the help of three other men: Gabbett, James "Jemmy" Vetch or "the Crow"
   and a man nicknamed "the moocher", while John Rex is in hospital with
   the fever. One night, a burning vessel is sighted and found out to be
   the Hydaspes; the ship on which Richard Devine is supposed to have
   sailed. The crew cannot be found. The following day, Dawes overhears
   the plans of the mutineers, but is taken to the hospital sick with the
   fever shortly afterwards. He manages to warn Captain Vickers and Doctor
   Pine about the plans. Sarah gets the Captain drunk and Frere otherwise
   busy but does not know about Vickers clandestinely doubling the guard.
   The mutiny is, therefore, unsuccessful, but Jemmy Vetch, who has
   understood that only Dawes could have betrayed them, gets his revenge
   by claiming that Dawes was the ring leader of the mutiny. Dawes is
   found guilty and receives a second life sentence.

   In 1833, at Macquarie Harbour, Maurice Frere has come to deliver to
   Captain Vickers the news that the settlement at Macquarie Harbour is to
   be abandoned and the convicts to be moved to Port Arthur. He also
   attempts to befriend Sylvia, but the child resents him ever since
   witnessing his treatment of the convicts (especially that of Dawes, who
   went to the quarterdeck to return her ball). Rufus Dawes has been the
   victim of several assassination attempts at the convicts' hands, but
   has also attempted escape twice and has a long record of bad conduct
   and punishments. At the moment of Frere's arrival, he is in solitary
   confinement on Grummet rock, a small island before the coast. Dawes has
   managed to recognise Frere at the harbour and now, seeing the
   preparations for the abandonment of the settlement, mistakenly assumes
   that Frere has taken command. Rather than suffer Frere's treatment upon
   his return, he attempts to drown himself.

   Meanwhile, it has been decided that Vickers should sail with the
   convicts and Frere follow with the brig Osprey with Mrs. Vickers and
   Sylvia, the pilot, five soldiers and ten convicts. Among the convicts
   is John Rex, who has again plans for mutiny. The convicts succeed in
   taking the boat, killing two soldiers, wounding one, and marooning him
   with the Vickers, the pilot and Frere. The pilot and the wounded man
   die shortly afterwards. One night, a man reaches their makeshift camp.
   It is Rufus Dawes, who has managed to swim to the settlement only to
   find it deserted. Although initially wary of him, the little community
   soon accepts Dawes, especially since he knows many ways to make their
   life more agreeable. Sylvia takes to him and Dawes soon does everything
   to please her, despite Frere's jealous attempts to win Sylvia's
   affection. It is also Dawes, who, after Sylvia mentioned the coracles
   of the Ancient Britons, plans and succeeds in building a boat out of
   saplings and goat hide. Although Frere promises Dawes a pardon, he
   nevertheless does not stop treating him like an inferior, at one point
   upsetting Dawes so much that he considers leaving on his own. Only
   Sylvia's writing in the sand, "Good Mr. Dawes", stops him. Through a
   hazard, Frere tells Dawes of the fate of his cousin and how narrowly he
   missed inheriting the Devine fortune. Dawes had not known about Sir
   Richard's death. Finally, they set to sea with Mrs. Vickers gravely ill
   and Sylvia soon also sick. After some time they are found by an
   American vessel at which point Frere takes the rudder of the boat and
   Sylvia in his arms.

   By 1838, in Port Arthur, Mrs. Vickers has died. Sylvia has lost all her
   memories of the incident at Macquarie Harbour and knows only what she
   has been told about it. She is now a young woman of sixteen and engaged
   to Captain Maurice Frere, who has told the story of the mutiny in his
   own way: making himself the hero and claiming that Dawes attempted to
   murder all three of them. News arrives that the surviving mutineers of
   the Osprey have been captured and are to be tried at Port Arthur. Sarah
   Purfoy calls on Frere and begs him to speak in Rex's favour, saying
   that he left them food and tools. She threatens to expose Frere's
   previous affairs to Sylvia. Frere consents to her demands. Rufus Dawes
   is also brought down from Hobart to identify the captured men. At the
   trial, he sees Sylvia again and realises that she is alive: he had been
   informed of her death. He tries to speak his case but is not allowed
   to. The mutineers get away with life sentences.

   Dawes escapes to see Sylvia again and begs her to speak, but in her
   amnesia she is afraid of him and calls for help. Dawes, too
   thunderstruck to leave, is immediately recaptured and sent back to
   Hobart. There, he meets the Reverend James North, a drunkard, whose
   failure to get up in time after a drinking night results in the death
   of a convict at the triangle, whom North had sworn to protect. Dawes is
   ordered to carry out the flogging and upon eventually refusing is
   flogged himself. Despite Dawes' initial hate for the man he considers
   to be a hypocrite, he is moved by North's begging for forgiveness and
   calling him "brother". The next time he asks to see the chaplain he
   finds that North, an enemy to the bishop for his impious vices, has
   been replaced by Meekin, a dainty man, who lectures him on his sins
   rather than attempting to console him.

   John Rex seeks Dawes and tries to persuade him to join him in an
   escape, organised by Sarah Purfoy. Dawes refuses. Through luck, Rex
   starts talking about the Devines and about how he was once employed to
   find news of their son. Dawes, appalled, asks if he would still
   recognise the man and Rex understands all of Dawes' story. When shortly
   afterward a warder confuses them both, commenting on how much they look
   alike, Rex hatches another plan.

   A few days later, Rex and another group of eight, led by Gabbett and
   Vetch, escape. It soon becomes apparent that Rex used the other men
   only as decoys. They get hopelessly lost in the bush and start eating
   one another, leaving only Gabbett and Vetch to struggle for not being
   the first to fall asleep. Later, Gabbett is found on a beach by the
   crew of a whaling vessel, with the half-eaten arm of one of his
   comrades hanging out of his swag. This part is based on a true story,
   that of Alexander Pearce.

   Rex reaches Sydney and, soon becoming weary of Sarah, escaping her to
   go to London, where he presents himself as Richard Devine. Lady Ellinor
   accepts him as her son.

   In Norfolk Island, by 1846, Reverend James North has been appointed
   prison chaplain. Shortly afterward, Captain Frere becomes Commandant of
   the Island, resolved to enforce discipline there. North, appalled at
   the horrible punishments inflicted but not really daring to interfere,
   renews his friendship with Dawes and also takes to Sylvia. Her marriage
   is an unhappy one. Frere has grown weary of his wife over the years and
   Sylvia married him only because she believed that she owed love to the
   man who allegedly saved her life. Dawes has also been on the Island for
   five years and again becomes Frere's target. Frere is resolved to break
   his opponent's spirit and finally succeeds after inflicting punishment
   upon punishment on him for several weeks. One night, Dawes and his two
   cell mates draw lots. The longest straw and old hand Blind Mooney is
   killed at the hands of the second, Bland, with Dawes as the witness.
   According to their plan, Bland and Dawes get sentenced to death.

   North, in the meantime, has had to realise the true nature of his
   affection for Sylvia. At first, he attempts to keep away from her, but
   this unfriendliness is ill-received by Frere, who gets his revenge on
   the convicts open to North's words, especially on Dawes. One day,
   Sylvia has gone to see Dawes. She has not been able to stop thinking
   about him as she feels that there is more to the story than she knows.
   She finds Dawes on the "stretcher" and orders his release. Frere is
   furious when he learns about it and strikes Sylvia, despite North's
   presence. North has sent his resignation two months previously. Sylvia
   had already decided to go and see her father to escape the grievances
   of her life on the Island. The two admit their feelings for one another
   but decide to keep quiet until they can sail. North visits Dawes and
   learns the true story of the mutiny and rescue. He promises to tell
   Sylvia Dawes' story but does not.

   Meanwhile, Sarah has found John Rex in London. He has led a life of
   debauchery, much to the disapproval of Lady Ellinor. Sarah threatens to
   denounce John if he does not introduce her as his wife. Ever since Rex
   wanted to sell the family house, Lady Ellinor's suspicions have reached
   the point where she attempts to test her alleged son. When she forbids
   him to sell the house, Rex says that it only is his right to do so.
   Lady Ellinor tells him that he has no rights to anything since Richard
   Devine was a bastard, the son of Lord Bellasis. Rex suddenly
   understands their strange resemblance: he is also a son of Lord
   Bellasis; his mother was a servant in his house. Rex confesses to the
   murder of Lord Bellasis, who laughed at him when told this story. Lady
   Ellinor promises Sarah to allow them to leave the country in exchange
   for information about her son. Sarah manages to get them both aboard a
   vessel bound for Sydney, but Rex dies of a stroke during the voyage.

   Shortly before leaving, North visits Dawes to confess that he never
   talked to Sylvia because he is himself in love with her. Dawes tells
   the priest that he knows nothing about love and recounts his own story
   to illustrate his words. North confesses to having been the one who
   robbed the corpse of Lord Bellasis, as the Lord held proofs against
   North, who had been forging bank notes. Begging forgiveness again,
   North leaves in great confusion, forgetting his hat and cloak. Dawes
   manages to get out and on the boat in this disguise as the drunken
   warder has not closed his cell door. North observes him leaving and
   decides that it is for the best. The ship on which Dawes and Sylvia
   sail soon gets into a storm. Sylvia, seeking comfort from the reverend,
   finds Dawes in his place, and now remembers the past as the gale
   reaches its greatest force.

   The next morning finds their entangled corpses on a piece of planking
   from the sunken ship.
