   John Carter's descendants

   In this novel the focus shifts from John Carter, Warlord of Mars, and
   Dejah Thoris of Helium, protagonists of the first three books in the
   series, to their son, Carthoris, prince of Helium, and Thuvia, princess
   of Ptarth. Helium and Ptarth are both prominent Barsoomian city
   state/empires, and both Carthoris and Thuvia were secondary characters
   in the previous two novels.

   Its plot devices are similar to the previous Martian novels, involving
   the kidnapping of a Martian princess. This time John Carter's son
   Carthoris is implicated. It does however have some inventive and
   original ideas, including an autopilot and collision detection device
   for Martian fliers, and the creation of the Lotharians, a race of
   ancient Martians who have become adept at telepathic projection, able
   to create imaginary warriors that can kill, and sustain themselves
   through thought alone.^[1]
