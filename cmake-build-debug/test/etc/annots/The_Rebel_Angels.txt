   The Rebel Angels follows several faculty and staff of the fictional
   College of St. John and Holy Ghost, affectionately referred to as
   "Spook".

   The story, like many of Davies', is notable for very strongly drawn and
   memorable characters:
     * The defrocked monk Parlabane, a brilliant and sinister sodomite
       with a thundering voice and voracious appetite;
     * Anglican priest and professor of New Testament Greek Simon
       Darcourt;
     * Maria Theotoky, a graduate student researching Rabelais;
     * Clement Hollier, a frazzled and absentminded professor; and
     * Urquhart McVarish, a greedy and manipulative counterpoint to
       Hollier.

   The novel's narration alternates between Theotoky's and Darcourt's
   points of view. Darcourt is attempting to write a history of the
   university based on Aubrey's Brief Lives.

   Much of the story is set in motion by the death of eccentric art patron
   and collector Francis Cornish. Hollier, McVarish, and Darcourt are the
   executors of Cornish's complicated will, which includes material that
   Hollier wants for his studies. The deceased's nephew Arthur Cornish,
   who stands to inherit the fortune, is also a character.
