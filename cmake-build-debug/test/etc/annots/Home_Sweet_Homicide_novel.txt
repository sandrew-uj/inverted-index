   Widowed mystery writer Marian Carstairs is a mother of three living off
   the sales of her books. Her children, Dinah (14), April (12), and
   Archie (10), inspired by reading their mother's fictitious mystery
   novels, decide to take part in some amateur sleuthing when they hear
   shots in the house next door. Understanding detective work from the
   novels, they take specific notes on clues that they encounter, but they
   also falsify their testimonies to the cops with the end goal of
   crediting the solved case back to their mother for publicity purposes.
   In addition to their detective work, the children also attempt to
   romantically connect the handsome police lieutenant, Bill Smith, on the
   case with their mother.
