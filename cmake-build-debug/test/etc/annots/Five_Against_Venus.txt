   After another boring day at Los Angeles High School, Bruce Robinson is
   delighted to hear that his long-unemployed father, Paul Robinson, has
   found a job - on the moon. A short time later the Robinson family
   boards the rocketship that will take them to meet the deep-space ship
   Sirius, which will take them to the moon. But as they approach the
   disc-shaped deep-space ship they see that, instead of Sirius, they will
   be riding the Aurora to the moon.

   Once the Robinsons have boarded the Aurora and settled in, Bruce meets
   Jim Gregor, who shows him the ship's controls. Bruce and Gregor then
   join the engineer and the captain (neither man is named in the story)
   in the cargo hold to move some boxes. When one of the boxes breaks open
   and reveals a strange-looking machine, the captain warns Bruce never to
   tell anyone what he saw.

   With the ship under way, Bruce develops a hunch that something has gone
   wrong. He sees that an emergency light has come on and informs Gregor.
   The pilot discovers that the ship's engines have been over-running and
   that the ship is on a course that will pass close to Venus (in the 1950
   movie Rocketship X-M the over-running of the engines takes the
   lunar-bound ship to Mars). With insufficient propellant to return to
   Earth, Gregor attempts to make an emergency landing on a mountainside
   and dies in the crash. Prior to the crash, the captain and the engineer
   bail out in a rocket-propelled lifeboat.

   Little more than shaken up in the crash, Bruce and his father recover
   supplies from the wrecked spaceship. The supplies include, to their
   astonishment, a pair of carbines and boxes of ammunition. Finding a
   cave next to a waterfall near the wreck, they move in and set up camp.

   On several occasions Bruce hears a soft rustling and on others he hears
   a ringing in his ears and feels heat on his face. The other members of
   the family have similar experiences and they dismiss them as part of
   getting acclimatized to an alien environment.

   With their supply of canned food running low, Paul and Bruce go
   hunting, assuming that Venusian animal life would be edible. They
   follow the stream coming out of their waterfall and soon find what
   appears to be an artificial enclosure woven from vines using trees as
   supports. Inside the improvised corral they encounter a creature
   similar to Diplodocus, but with a tame demeanor. They drive the docile
   creature toward their cave, intending to butcher it when they arrive,
   but change their decision and keep it as a pet after it saves Frank
   from a carnivorous plant.

   Having brought samples of the tubers and the pear-like fruit that the
   beast had eaten, Paul and Bruce find them edible and the family begins
   eating them when their canned food runs out. Meanwhile, Paul is getting
   sick from the infection of a cut he suffered when he hit his arm
   against a rock. Later, after he has a good amount of sleep, Paul's arm
   heals, seemingly in spite of having been covered by the fast-growing
   green mold that grows on any and all organic substances.

   While foraging for more tubers, Bruce hears a ringing in his ears,
   feels his face grow hot, and then loses consciousness. He is awakened
   by a strange man who introduces himself as Bram Simmons, a scientist
   who came to Venus alone five years earlier. Nearby stand several
   man-sized bat-like creatures whose ultrasonic emissions had knocked
   Bruce out. Simmons shoos the bat-men away and tells Bruce what kind of
   trouble he and his family are in. The bat-men are vampires, usually
   drawing blood from the dinosaur-like beasts kept in corrals around the
   area, and that there is a large colony of bat-men nearby.

   After Bruce returns to the cave, as night is falling, the Robinsons
   come under attack. At first Paul and Bruce repel the attackers with
   their carbines, but then they run out of ammunition. As all seems lost,
   star shells and grenades explode in the valley below the cave, and the
   bat-men, thrown into confusion and distress, flee the scene: the space
   marines have landed.

   Having assumed that no one survived the crash of the Aurora, the
   spacemen have come to retrieve the gadget that Aurora's captain had
   warned Bruce not to mention. It is a top-secret military machine -- and
   Frank has been playing with it! With the machine in hand, the spacemen
   take the Robinsons back to Earth with them: Simmons chooses to stay on
   Venus, living with the bat-men.

   At home the Robinsons have been hounded by reporters, but now their
   fame is waning. One man, though, seeks them out to offer them
   something. He represents a pharmaceutical company to which Bruce took
   samples of Venusian life, and he tells the Robinsons that the green
   mold that was such a nuisance produces an antibiotic more powerful than
   penicillin. He then tells the Robinsons that his company is offering
   them enough money to solve their financial problems for years to come.
