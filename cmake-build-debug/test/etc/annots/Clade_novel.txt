   In Clade, the Ecocaust, an environmental disaster, causes major
   problems such as rising sea levels and additional strains on human
   resources. Although civilization recovers from this disaster, they do
   so at the expense of their previous freedoms. "Polycorps" develop from
   governments and corporations. The wonders of biotech introduce a new
   class system where human beings have been socially engineered at the
   molecular level through a process called "clading." This "clading"
   process places entire socioeconomic or ethnic groups made to be
   biologically predisposed to live in particular communities. If a person
   enters a community that they have not been claded to, the consequences
   could be devastating, resulting in sickness or death. Although it is
   not intentionally racist, businesses and retail outlets using this
   clading process to keep away the riffraff, will simply screen out
   clientele below a certain prosperity level. Therefore, a black market
   exists enabling people to buy the right biotech to inhibit the
   "pherions" in their systems to be placed in a certain clade.

   The protagonist is a man named Rigo, a Latino from the San Jose clade
   who wants to move up in society. Rigo accepts a job at a biotech firm
   that develops special vegetation for a planned orbital colony. Although
   his friends look down on him with contempt for selling out, he still
   maintains a close relationship with his mother, lawless brother, and
   Anthea, his troubled girlfriend. At work, after Rigo fears being
   exposed to some dangerous pherions, he finds to his surprise that the
   company he works for eagerly wants to send some of the plants they've
   been working on into space; and they want Rigo to supervise the
   transfer. Something about the haste of the company leaves Rigo feeling
   fishy. The secrets of this story unravel one after another, leading to
   holes in the plot.
