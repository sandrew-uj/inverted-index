   This book is about a man named Thomas Hunter in Denver, Colorado, 2010,
   who, after being knocked unconscious from a bullet wound to the head,
   wakes up to find himself in a strange world full of black, twisted
   trees. After being attacked by evil bats called Shataiki and led out of
   the Black Forest by a white bat, he is rendered unconscious again due
   to blood loss. He wakes up to find himself back in Denver.

   Startled at the sudden change, he can't figure out which world is real.
   He soon discovers that every time he falls asleep, he wakes up in the
   other world, until he falls asleep there.

   Outside of the Black Forest is the Colored Forest, a paradise inhabited
   by a civilization of immortal-yet innocent-human beings who are watched
   over by Elyon, a God-like being, along with white, bat-like Roush, who
   are opposites of the Shataiki and act as servants of Elyon.

   Thomas eventually finds out that this other world is our own thousands
   of years in the future, and that a virus, mutated from the Raison
   vaccine, would wipe out his present-day Earth later that year.

   Thomas is forced to fight evil in both worlds, a difficult prospect,
   for while evil is portrayed differently in each reality, it is equally
   as potent, and Thomas quickly finds that putting a stop to an event of
   apocalyptic proportions is no easy task.^[1]
