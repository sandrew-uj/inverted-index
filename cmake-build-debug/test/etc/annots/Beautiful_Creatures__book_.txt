   Sixteen-year-old Ethan Wate lives in Gatlin, South Carolina, with his
   widowed father. Lena Duchannes is a mysterious girl with magical powers
   who appears in Ethan's recurring nightmares. Though she initially
   rebuffs his attempts at interacting with her, they eventually become
   friends despite harassment from other classmates that almost gets her
   expelled. Lena's uncle Macon Ravenwood also attempts to keep Ethan and
   Lena apart to protect them. Every member of Lena's family is a "Caster"
   with magical powers. On Lena's sixteenth birthday, she will be
   "claimed" as either a Light or Dark Caster, but she is terrified of
   becoming an evil Dark Caster.

   Meanwhile, Ethan discovers a locket at Greenbrier plantation, that
   induces visions of Lena's ancestor Genevieve Duchannes and Ethan's
   ancestor Ethan Carter Wate, who were engaged during the Civil War.
   Through the locket, they discover that Genevieve tried to resurrect
   Ethan Carter Wate using the magical Book of Moons. Due to Genevieve's
   use of the spell, the Book has the ability to determine which of the
   Duchannes will be Light or Dark. Ethan and Lena find the Book of Moons
   in Genevieve's grave and study it for ways to prevent Lena from
   becoming Dark. Furthermore, Lena is continuously spiritually attacked
   by a Dark Caster named Sarafine, who is actually her mother. While the
   Duchannes cannot prevent the attacks, Ethan's presence seems to stop
   them.

   Lena's sixteenth birthday is celebrated by Ethan, the Duchannes, and
   her classmates. Macon forbids Lena to attend the party set up by her
   classmates, but Lena sneaks out anyway and confesses her love to Ethan,
   who reciprocates. Sarafine reveals herself at the party, accompanied by
   incubus Hunting Ravenwood. Sarafine tells Lena that she will be able to
   Claim herself for the Dark or Light at midnight. If she chooses to go
   Dark, all the Light Casters in her family will die, but she would be
   able to have a previously-impossible physical relationship with Ethan.
   If she chooses to go Light, all the Dark Casters in her family will
   die, including Macon. A fight occurs, culminating in Sarafine escaping
   and Hunting nearly killing Macon. After Ethan gathers the other
   Duchannes for help, Ethan searches for Lena, but instead meets
   Sarafine, who kills him. At midnight, Lena uses her power over nature
   to block out the moonlight, preventing her from being claimed. She
   negotiates with Amma and then recites a spell from the Book of Moons to
   resurrect Ethan. The spell works, but at what cost?
