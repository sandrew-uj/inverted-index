   The events of Surface Detail take place around 2970 AD, according to
   Banks.^[3] The events occur six to eight hundred years after the "Chel
   Debacle", depicted in the earlier novel Look to Windward which is set
   seventy-eight years after the events in Use of Weapons.

   Each chapter of the book covers one or more of the six main
   protagonists--Lededje Y'breq, a chattel slave; Joiler Veppers, an
   industrialist and playboy; Gyorni Vatueil, a soldier; Prin and Chay,
   Pavulean academics; and Yime Nsokyi, a Quietus agent. Some of the plot
   occurs in simulated environments. As the book begins, a war game--the
   "War in Heaven"--has been running for several decades. The outcome of
   the simulated war will determine whether societies are allowed to run
   artificial Hells, virtual afterlives in which the mind-states of the
   dead are tortured. The Culture, fiercely anti-Hell, has opted to stay
   out of the war while accepting the outcome as binding.

   Vatueil is a soldier who has fought his way up the ranks of the war
   game to a position where he can determine policy. He is instrumental in
   the decision to cheat--first by attempting to hack into and subvert the
   war-game, and when this fails by moving the simulated war into the real
   world.

   Prin and Chay belong to a species that use the threat of Hell to
   control the behaviour of their population. While still alive, they
   enter the Pavulean Hell on a mission to reveal the existence and
   details of this Hell to the general population. Prin succeeds in
   getting out, but has to leave his partner Chay behind, where she is
   subsequently tortured, restored to some semblance of sanity, and
   finally given a role as an angel in Hell who is able to release one
   soul a day by killing them. Prin testifies to the Pavulean parliament
   of his experience in Hell and attempts to convince them that it should
   be abolished.

   Veppers is the richest individual in his society, the multi-planet
   Sichultian Enablement. Y'breq, a frequent victim of rape by Veppers, is
   murdered by him as she attempts to escape. She is unexpectedly
   reincarnated ("revented," in Culture terms) aboard a Culture ship,
   having been secretly implanted with a neural lace some ten years
   before. She immediately wants to return to her homeworld, to find and
   kill Veppers.

   The book hinges on Veppers' involvement in the War in Heaven. He
   initially appears to be a bit-player, but his involvement is gradually
   revealed to be more and more critical. The final revelation is that he
   has made some of his fortune by providing the hardware to run the Hells
   of various species; over a century he has accumulated about 70% of all
   the Hells. The hardware is located on his country estate on the planet
   Sichult. He sets up a secret deal to have the Hells destroyed in an
   attack which is to be blamed upon the Culture. His motivation is that
   such an attack will release him from his contracts to run the Hells,
   which would have become worthless if the anti-Hell side won, but which
   he cannot wriggle out of in any other way.

   Y'breq travels back to Sichult on the Falling Outside The Normal Moral
   Constraints, an advanced and "very slightly psychotic" Culture warship.
   In hot pursuit is Yime Nsokyi, a Culture agent tasked with preventing
   Y'breq from killing Veppers. As they and their ships arrive, things
   come to a head.

   The Culture agents conspire to arrange that the attack on Veppers'
   estate successfully destroys the Hells, while simultaneously appearing
   to attempt to stop the attack. They also conspire to ensure that
   Veppers' secret deal is revealed. Veppers himself is at the estate's
   mansion during the attack, where Y'breq finds him for the final,
   personal, showdown.

   The epilogue reveals Vatueil's identity as Zakalwe, using an alias that
   is an anagram of Livueta, the character in Use of Weapons whose
   forgiveness Zakalwe sought.
