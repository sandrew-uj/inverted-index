   Inferno is based upon the hell described in Dante's Inferno. However,
   it adds a modern twist to the story. The story is told in the first
   person by Allen Carpenter (who spelled his name "Carpentier" on his
   novels), an agnostic science fiction writer who died in a failed
   attempt to entertain his fans at a science fiction convention party. He
   is only released, after many decades, from a Djinn-bottle in the
   Vestibule on the outer edge to Hell when he finally calls upon God for
   mercy. Upon release he is met by Benito, or Benny, a Virgil-like figure
   whose full identity is not immediately apparent. Benito offers to take
   him out of Hell by bringing him to the center.

   At first, as Allen and Benito travel through Hell, Allen tries to
   scientifically rationalize everything he sees, renaming his
   surroundings as 'Infernoland', a high-tech amusement park some thousand
   years in the future. It isn't until he sees a man recover from
   incineration and his own leg heal from a compound fracture that he
   starts to actually believe that he is in Hell. From this point on, as
   Allen travels through the inner circles of Hell, he sees how he is
   guilty of each of the sins in some fashion, commenting to himself that
   he is in no danger from ditch 3 of circle 8 (simony) only because he
   has never had any holy offices to sell. At first Allen views the
   punishments for these sins as far surpassing the crime, repeatedly
   thinking, "We're in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism",
   although he comes more and more to accept the justice of the situation
   as he realizes that it is their continuing denial of their sins that
   keeps many of the condemned in hell. Eventually Allen takes over
   Benito's role in helping reformed souls proceed onto Paradise via
   Purgatory, allowing Benito to move on towards Purgatory himself. It is
   revealed that Benito is actually Benito Mussolini, the former dictator
   of Italy.

   Along the way Allen meets a number of his Californian acquaintances and
   notable people from history (e.g. Epictetus, Billy the Kid, Jesse
   James, Bob Ford, L Ron Hubbard, Henry VIII of England, Vlad Tepes,
   Aimee Semple McPherson, William M. Tweed, Al Capone) and from classical
   mythology (e.g. Hector, Aeneas, Charon, Minos, Phlegyas, Geryon). Due
   to the long time he spent bottled up in the outer vestibule he also
   meets some people from the future of 1976, such as a space shuttle
   pilot.
