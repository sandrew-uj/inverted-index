   The story opens when Tyler Dupree is twelve years old. Tyler and his
   mother live in a guest house on the property of aerospace millionaire
   E.D. Lawton and his alcoholic wife, Carol. Tyler is friends with the
   couple's thirteen-year-old twins: Jason, a brilliant student who is
   being groomed to take over the family business, and Diane, with whom
   Tyler is in love. One night while stargazing, the three children
   witness all the stars simultaneously disappear. Telecommunications
   suffer as every satellite falls out of orbit simultaneously. Attempts
   to communicate with the ISS are unsuccessful.

   An opaque black "spin membrane" has been placed around Earth. The
   membrane has slowed time so that approximately 3.17 years pass outside
   the membrane for every second within, or 100 million years on the
   outside for every year within. The membrane is permeable to spacecraft,
   and it protects Earth from the harmful effects of concentrated stellar
   radiation and cometary impact. A simulated sun on the inside of the
   membrane allows for a largely normal life cycle to continue. However,
   the passage of time outside the membrane means that all life on earth
   will end in a few decades when the sun's expansion makes that region of
   the solar system uninhabitable.

   Jason becomes obsessed with gaining knowledge about the membrane and
   how to deactivate it. He studies science and eventually rises to run
   the day-to-day operations of Perihelion, an aerospace research firm
   that gets folded into the government and coordinates efforts to deal
   with the Spin. Diane joins the quasi-religious "New Kingdom" movement,
   a Christian sect that endorses hedonism and indulgence. She marries a
   man named Simon, whom she meets through the NK movement. Tyler attends
   medical school and becomes a doctor. Jason hires Tyler as a staff
   physician.

   Perihelion terraforms Mars, a process that is finished in a few months
   of subjective Earth time. When the terraforming is complete, Perihelion
   and its counterparts in other nations launch manned colonization
   missions. Two years after the terraforming process begins, Earth
   receives satellite images confirming the existence of agriculture and
   sophisticated human civilizations on Mars. Soon afterward, Mars is
   enclosed in its own Spin membrane.

   Before the membrane went up, the Martians sent their own manned mission
   to Earth. The Martian ambassador, Wun Ngo Wen, is part of a
   civilization hundreds of thousands of years old that has been
   experimenting with biotechnology for centuries. Jason, who has
   developed an acute form of multiple sclerosis that is incurable by
   terrestrial medicine, takes a Martian bio-engineering product that
   extends his life by decades, putting him into a fourth stage of life
   past adulthood. Jason and Wun Ngo Wen then seed nanotechnology
   throughout the outer solar system. This technology will eventually
   expand to other star systems over the course of millions of years and
   search for other worlds enclosed by Spin membranes, hopefully
   discovering why they were created and if anything can be done to stop
   them.

   Tyler leaves Perihelion and moves to California. There he gets a
   desperate call from Simon, stating that Diane is terribly sick. Diane
   and Simon had moved from the ashes of the NK movement to join a more
   cult-like fringe movement that was trying to hasten the Second Coming
   through genetic engineering of cattle. As Tyler heads to meet Diane,
   the Spin membrane seems to falter and fail, allowing the stars to
   return to the sky. The next day, the sun rises huge and red in the sky
   causing terrible heat and high winds. Millions across the world panic
   as the apparent end has come. Tyler finds Diane suffering from a fatal
   cardiovascular disease that crossed from cows to humans during the
   attempts by religious fringe to breed a totally red calf, which they
   think will bring out the end of the world. The only cure is to give her
   the same treatment that Jason has taken. He and Simon drive Diane back
   to Diane's childhood home where Tyler had hidden some of the Martian
   biotech. Simon, however, leaves Tyler and Diane and gives them his
   blessing, and is never seen again. Tyler discovers that Jason is at the
   house, dying of a mysterious ailment. Jason explains that he has become
   a human receiver for the nanotechnology they seeded throughout the
   galaxy. He also explains his conclusions about the nature of the Spin
   and the Hypotheticals who created it. The Hypotheticals are intelligent
   Von Neumann machines that spread throughout the galaxy billions of
   years ago. Horrified at the rise and fall of biological societies, they
   devised a plan to enclose planets on the verge of societal collapse in
   Spin membranes to slow their advancement until a way could be found to
   save them. Jason dies shortly after explaining this and has Tyler mail
   copies of the information to trusted informants.

   Tyler gives the Martian treatment to Diane, who recovers. Shortly
   after, the membrane partially reasserts itself, allowing the stars to
   be seen and synchronizing Earth time with that of the universe, but
   filtering the solar radiation to a survivable level. It's discovered
   that the Spin membrane had been retracted to let a massive ring descend
   and embed itself in the Indian Ocean. The "Arch", as it becomes known,
   acts as a portal to another world, one engineered by the Hypotheticals
   to give mankind a new chance at life. A decade after the appearance of
   the Arch, Diane and Tyler, now married, flee from agents of the United
   States government who seek to arrest them for possessing forbidden
   Martian technology. Tyler takes the same cure that Jason and Diane did,
   becoming a "Fourth" himself, and Tyler and Diane pass through the Arch
   with a group of Indonesian refugees. They scatter Jason's ashes in the
   crossing between Earth and the other world so that he finally can be at
   peace.
