   The protagonist, an unnamed British sportsman and crack shot, sets out
   in the spring of 1938 to see if he can get an unnamed European dictator
   in the sights of his rifle. Supposedly interested only in the thrill of
   hunting a powerful man, he convinces himself that he does not intend to
   pull the trigger. Caught while taking aim by officers of the dictator's
   secret police, he is tortured, thrown over a cliff, and left for dead.

   The man survives, and with civilian help manages to make his way to a
   port, where he stows away on a British ship bound for London. Once
   there, he discovers that agents of the dictator have also arrived in
   London with orders to kill him. He is forced to kill one by pushing him
   onto the live rail in the London Underground, after which the police
   launch a manhunt for him.

   Unable to go to the British authorities, who cannot condone
   assassination of a head of state, the protagonist decides to hide out
   in Dorset. Reports that he has been sighted reach a man named
   Quive-Smith, the leader of his pursuers. Seizing the opportunity,
   Quive-Smith finds his quarry's hiding place and blocks the exit,
   leaving only a single hole for breathing. He intends to capture his
   prey alive and execute him properly.

   The protagonist reflects on his predicament and confesses to himself
   that he would in fact have pulled the trigger, as revenge for the
   execution of his fiancee by the dictator's totalitarian regime.
   Constructing a makeshift ballista (a kind of cross-bow), he tricks
   Quive-Smith into looking down the breathing hole and shoots him dead.
   Taking Quive-Smith's identification papers, money, and car, he drives
   to Liverpool and boards a ship for Tangier. From there, he intends to
   find the dictator and finish what he started.
