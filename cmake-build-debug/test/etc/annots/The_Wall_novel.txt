   Accompanied by her cousin and her cousin's husband, the 40-year-old
   narrator travels to the Austrian mountains. They plan on staying in a
   hunting lodge for the weekend, but the next morning the woman finds
   herself alone with her cousins' dog, Luchs. The couple, who planned on
   having dinner in the valley, did not return. The woman leaves to look
   for the couple but soon discovers why they did not come back: a
   seemingly endless, invisible wall separates her from the other side of
   the valley.

   In an attempt to find out what had happened, she uses binoculars to
   look for other people. The only other person she can see is a man who
   seems to be frozen still. It seems to her that a tragedy killed all
   living creatures on the other side of the wall. She is entirely alone,
   protected and trapped, in equal measure, by the invisible wall.

   All her attempts to get to the other side of the wall fail, so she
   slowly starts to adjust to her new situation. Because the area in which
   she is trapped is fairly wide, she learns to live off her supplies, the
   fruits and animals of the surrounding forest, and her garden. Besides
   looking after herself she soon starts to look after the animals who are
   dependent on her: a dog, cats, and a pregnant cow. With the winter
   coming she starts writing a report that makes up the book, unsure
   whether anyone will ever read it.

   Towards the end of the novel, the first and only other person appears.
   He kills her dog and calf, apparently with no reason for doing so. She
   shoots him, ending perhaps her only chance of ever interacting with a
   human again.

   The story ends with her writing that the cow is pregnant again, and she
   is hoping that the cat will have new kittens. But she is also running
   out of ammunition and matches, so her future might become even more
   difficult. At the end of the book, her fate is unknown.
