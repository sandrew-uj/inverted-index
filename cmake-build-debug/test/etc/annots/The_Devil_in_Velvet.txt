   Cambridge Professor of history Nicholas Fenton, in the England of 1925,
   makes a bargain with the devil and is sent back in time to Restoration
   London in 1675 to solve a murder that is about to take place, in the
   body of Sir Nick Fenton. Fenton soon finds himself in love with the
   intended victim, Sir Nick's wife Lydia, and resolves to alter the
   course of history by preventing her murder. Fenton's mastery of 20th
   century swordsmanship makes him a fearsome antagonist in 1675, so much
   so that he becomes known as "the devil in velvet". Also involved in the
   action is a woman who has also sold her soul to the devil and travelled
   back in time, and Fenton finds himself torn between the two women. He
   must not only solve the approaching murder before it happens, but come
   to terms with Sir Nick's romantic and political entanglements--and even
   void his deal with the devil.
