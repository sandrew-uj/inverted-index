   The year is A.W. 15. 15 years after the end of the 7th Space War which
   led to the catastrophic destruction of much of the world, the surviving
   residents of Earth try to make a living as best they can in the
   post-apocalyptic landscape. Mobile Suits and weapons left over from the
   war fall into the hands of civilians as well as other organizations on
   the planet. In an effort to keep the past from repeating itself, Jamil
   Neate brings together a crew of Vultures to search for Newtypes and
   protect them from being exploited. As they try to carry out this task,
   an old government rises from the ashes to try and unify the Earth as
   other forces slowly fan the flames of war once more between the newly
   formed New United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army. Now
   the crew of the Freeden face a multitude of enemies as they try to
   prevent another catastrophic war.
