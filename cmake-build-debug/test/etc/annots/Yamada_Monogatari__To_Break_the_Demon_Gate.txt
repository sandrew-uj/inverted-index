   Minor nobleman Yamada no Goji, a demon hunter of Heian period Japan, is
   a hard-bitten private investigator of supernatural mysteries, who plies
   his hand-to-mouth trade with the help of a ghostly informant Seita and
   a drunken lapsed Buddhist priest named Kenji.

   Yamada's former lover Teiko, wife of the previous emperor Suzaku and
   mother of current emperor Reizei's heir Takahito, enlists him to dispel
   malicious gossip undermining her position and ensure her son's
   succession to the throne. Partnered with Teiko's brother Prince
   Kanemore, Lord Yamada retrieves a purloined letter purported to prove
   her innocence, only to see it result in her disgrace, exile, and
   suicide.

   Subsequently, Yamada succeeds in discrediting Teiko's enemy, Lord
   Fujiwara no Sentaro, and apparently safeguarding the succession, only
   to see the threat re-emerge in a new form. A seemingly reformed Sentaro
   has been installed at the head of a prominent monastery north of the
   capital, and a menacing spiritual pall gathers over the city that
   panics even its supernatural residents. People are dying in
   inexplicable ways, and Kanemore and Yamada are both convinced that
   Takahito's life is also in peril.

   Complications ensue as Yamada's ghostly ally Seita vanishes, and he is
   approached by the beguiling Lady Snow, who holds out the possibility of
   clearing the name of his disgraced late father.
