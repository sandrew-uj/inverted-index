   A highly contagious, aggression-inducing virus called "Rage" is
   unleashed in Great Britain after an infected chimpanzee is freed by a
   group of animal liberation activists. It spreads quickly among the
   international populace, resulting in societal collapse. Twenty-eight
   days after the initial outbreak, bicycle courier Jim awakens from a
   coma in St Thomas' Hospital in London, which has been deserted with
   signs of catastrophe. Jim is attacked by infected humans, but rescued
   by survivors Selena and Mark. At Jim's request, the group travels to
   his parents' house in Deptford, where he learns they committed suicide.
   That night, Mark is bitten during an infected attack, prompting Selena
   to kill him before he turns.

   Jim and Selena encounter cab driver Frank and his daughter Hannah at
   Balfron Tower, from whom they learn of a military broadcast offering
   protection at a blockade in Manchester. With supplies dwindling, Frank
   asks Jim and Selena to accompany him and Hannah to the blockade, which
   they accept. The group travels to Manchester in Frank's cab, but upon
   arriving, they find the blockade deserted. As the group struggles to
   plot their next move, Frank is infected when a drop of blood falls into
   his eye. The soldiers arrive shortly afterwards and kill Frank.

   The remaining survivors are brought to a fortified mansion under the
   command of Major Henry West. However, the safety promised by the
   soldiers turns out to be false when West reveals to Jim that the
   broadcast was intended to lure female survivors into sexual slavery to
   repopulate the world. The soldiers attempt to kill Jim after he refuses
   to be complicit with their plan, but Jim escapes. After luring West
   away from the mansion, Jim releases Private Mailer, an infected soldier
   kept chained for observations, resulting in the deaths of West's men.
   Jim attacks Mitchell, brutally killing him bashing his head against the
   wall, and finally ending him by gouging his eyes out. Jim, Selena, and
   Hannah attempt to leave in Frank's cab, but West sneaks into the back
   seat and shoots Jim. Hannah retaliates by putting the cab in reverse,
   allowing Mailer to kill West by pulling him through the rear window,
   while the three survivors drive off.

   Another 28 days later, Jim recovers at a remote cottage in Cumbria,
   where the infected are shown dying of starvation. As a Finnish fighter
   jet flies overhead, Jim, Selena, and Hannah unfurl a huge cloth banner
   spelling the word "HELLO." The three survivors optimistically watch the
   jet as they hope the pilot has spotted them.
