   The Belgariad is a five-book fantasy epic written by David Eddings,
   following the journey of protagonist Garion and his companions, first
   to recover a sacred stone, and later to use it against antagonist
   Torak. It was a bestseller from the first book in the series. It has
   been called both the "last gasp" of traditional fantasy and "one of the
   founding megasagas" of modern fantasy.
