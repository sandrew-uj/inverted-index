   Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland is one of ten children of a
   country clergyman. Although a tomboy in her childhood, by the age of 17
   she is "in training for a heroine" and is excessively fond of reading
   Gothic novels, among which Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho is a
   favourite.

   Catherine is invited by the Allens (her wealthier neighbours in
   Fullerton) to accompany them to visit the city of Bath and partake in
   the winter season of balls, theatre and other social delights. Soon she
   is introduced to a clever young gentleman, Henry Tilney, with whom she
   dances and converses. Through Mrs. Allen's old schoolfriend Mrs.
   Thorpe, she meets her daughter Isabella, a vivacious and flirtatious
   young woman, and the two quickly become friends. Mrs. Thorpe's son,
   John, is also a friend of Catherine's older brother, James, at Oxford
   where they are both students.

   The Thorpes are not happy about Catherine's friendship with the
   Tilneys, as they correctly perceive Henry as a rival for Catherine's
   affections, though Catherine is not at all interested in the crude John
   Thorpe. Catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the
   Thorpes and the Tilneys, though John Thorpe continuously tries to
   sabotage her relationship with the Tilneys. This leads to several
   misunderstandings, which put Catherine in the awkward position of
   having to explain herself to the Tilneys.

   Isabella and James become engaged. James' father approves of the match
   and offers his son a country parson's living of a modest sum, -L-400
   annually, but they must wait until he can obtain the benefice in two
   and a half years. Isabella is dissatisfied, but to Catherine, she
   misrepresents her distress as being caused solely by the delay, and not
   by the value of the sum. Isabella immediately begins to flirt with
   Captain Tilney, Henry's older brother. Innocent Catherine cannot
   understand her friend's behaviour, but Henry understands all too well,
   as he knows his brother's character and habits.

   The Tilneys invite Catherine to stay with them for a few weeks at their
   home, Northanger Abbey. Catherine, in accordance with her novel
   reading, expects the abbey to be exotic and frightening. Henry teases
   her about this, as it turns out that Northanger Abbey is pleasant and
   decidedly not Gothic. However, the house includes a mysterious suite of
   rooms that no one ever enters; Catherine learns that they were the
   apartments of Mrs. Tilney, who died nine years earlier. As General
   Tilney no longer appears to be ill-affected by her death, Catherine
   decides that he may have murdered her or even imprisoned her in her
   chamber.

   Catherine discovers that her over-active imagination has led her
   astray, as nothing is strange or distressing in the apartments.
   Unfortunately, Henry questions her; he surmises, and informs her that
   his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her
   death. She leaves, crying, fearing that she has lost Henry's regard
   entirely. Realising how foolish she has been, Catherine comes to
   believe that, though novels may be delightful, their content does not
   relate to everyday life. Henry does not mention this incident to her
   again.

   James writes to inform her that he has broken off his engagement to
   Isabella and that she has become engaged instead to Captain Tilney.
   Henry and Eleanor Tilney are sceptical that their brother has actually
   become engaged to Isabella Thorpe. Catherine is terribly disappointed,
   realising what a dishonest person Isabella is. A subsequent letter from
   Isabella herself confirms the Tilney siblings' doubts, and shows that
   Frederick Tilney was merely flirting with Isabella. The General goes
   off to London, and the atmosphere at Northanger Abbey immediately
   becomes lighter and pleasanter for his absence. Catherine passes
   several enjoyable days with Henry and Eleanor until, in Henry's
   absence, the General returns abruptly, in a temper. He forces Catherine
   to go home early the next morning, in a shocking, inhospitable, and
   unsafe move that forces Catherine to undertake the 70 miles (110 km)
   journey alone.

   At home, Catherine is listless and unhappy. Henry pays a sudden
   unexpected visit and explains what happened. General Tilney (on the
   misinformation of John Thorpe) had believed her to be exceedingly rich
   as the Allens' prospective heiress, and therefore a proper match for
   Henry. In London, General Tilney ran into Thorpe again, who, angry and
   petty at Catherine's refusal of his half-made proposal of marriage,
   said instead that she was nearly destitute. Enraged, General Tilney,
   (again on the misinformation of John Thorpe), returned home to evict
   Catherine. When Henry returned to Northanger, his father informed him
   of what had occurred and forbade him to think of Catherine again. When
   Henry learns how she had been treated, he breaks with his father and
   tells Catherine he still wants to marry her despite his father's
   disapproval. Catherine is delighted, though when Henry seeks her
   parents' approval, they tell the young couple that final approval will
   only happen when General Tilney consents.

   Eventually, General Tilney acquiesces, because Eleanor has become
   engaged to a wealthy and titled man; and he discovers that the
   Morlands, while not extremely rich, are far from destitute.
