   In the year 2025, a nuclear holocaust has left New York City an
   irradiated, but not abandoned, wasteland. (It appears the Nuclear War
   that caused the devastation happened in the late 1980s or early 1990s
   based on the technology people have available.)  The ruined city is
   inhabited now by scavenger packs and telepathic mutants, who are
   persecuted by the elite survivors. Keeping the few remaining people
   pacified is the reality television program Endgame, where hunters and
   gladiators fight to the death for large financial winnings.

   The elites in power in the city have their security forces seeking out
   and killing mutants who populate the ruins of the city. The non-mutant
   Professor Levin helps the mutants survive and hide from the security
   forces seeking to kill them.

   The star and veteran fighter from Endgame, Ron Shannon (Al Cliver),
   convinces his nemesis to help him assembles a team to take a group of
   mind-reading mutants across the desert to safety. They need to avoid
   such dangers as blind fighting monks, nomadic predators, government
   agents, and Shannon's friend, now turned nemesis, Karnak (George
   Eastman). The leader of the mutants is Lilith (Laura Gemser) and she
   has promised that if the assembled by Shaanon can succeed in getting
   the mutants to safety, a fortune awaits
