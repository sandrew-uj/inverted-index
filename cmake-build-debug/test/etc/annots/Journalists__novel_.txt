   The novel begins with a bomb explosion at the newspaper Moskovskij
   Bogomolets (Moscow Believer), which kills a famous Moscow journalist
   and affects the paper's editorial staff. The main character of the
   novel, Sergei Ogloedov, is a journalist from the newspaper. The
   newspaper is very similar to the actual Moskovskij Komsomolets, and the
   novel's action follows similar events in the 1990s and early 2000s. The
   story focuses on the tragic love relationship between Sergei Ogloedov
   and Natasha Guseva, a fling from their time at Moscow State University
   that revives as they both join the editorial staff of Moskovskij
   Bogomolets.
