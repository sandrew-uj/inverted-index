   Brink takes place in the near future during the mid-21st century on an
   artificial floating island called the Ark. Built during the years
   2010s, it was conceived as an environmentally and economically
   self-sustainable city, a contemporary model for green, ecological
   living. However, global warming lead to a dramatic rise in sea levels
   around the world, causing most of the known land masses to disappear
   and civilization to collapse. Decades later, the Ark has become a place
   for refugees coming from all around the world as they view the
   innovative island as the only suitable place to survive. The Ark is now
   home to tens of thousands more people than it was originally meant to
   sustain, and its supposedly renewable resources and technologies are
   being drained to the extreme limit. Now, the Ark exists in total
   isolation and has lost contact with the outside world, with many people
   believing that the entire planet has been submerged by the oceans
   completely. Most of the refugees live in tight spaces arranged from
   rusty shipping containers and wreckage, constantly having to deal with
   extreme poverty and degradation while the original inhabitants of the
   Ark, the Founders, reside in its luxury districts. These frictions have
   caused a civil war to begin, between the revolutionary forces of the
   Resistance and the military troops of the Ark Security.
