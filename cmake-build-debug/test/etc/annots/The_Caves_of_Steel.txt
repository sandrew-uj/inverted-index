   In this novel, Isaac Asimov introduces Elijah Baley and R. Daneel
   Olivaw, later his favorite protagonists. They live roughly three
   millennia in Earth's future, a time when hyperspace travel has been
   discovered, and a few worlds relatively close to Earth have been
   colonized - fifty planets known as the "Spacer worlds". The Spacer
   worlds are rich, have low population density (average population of one
   hundred million each), and use robot labor heavily. Meanwhile, Earth is
   overpopulated (with a total population of eight billion, three times
   that of Asimov's 1950s) and strict rules against robots have been
   passed. In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the first of which is
   The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim situation of an Earth dealing with
   an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers, who limit
   birth to permit great wealth and privacy.

   Asimov described himself as a claustrophile: "I wrote a novel in 1953
   which pictured a world in which everyone lived in underground cities,
   comfortably enclosed away from the open air. People would say, 'How
   could you imagine such a nightmarish situation?' And I would answer in
   astonishment, 'What nightmarish situation?'"^[3] The "caves of steel"
   are vast city complexes covered by huge metal domes, capable of
   supporting tens of millions each: the New York City of that era
   (wherein much of the story is set) encompasses present-day New York
   City, as well as large tracts of New Jersey. Asimov imagines the
   present day's underground transit connected to malls and apartment
   blocks, until no one ever exits the domes, and most of the population
   suffer from extreme fear of leaving them. Even though the Robot and
   Foundation series were not considered part of the same fictional
   universe until much later, the "caves of steel" resemble the planet
   Trantor.

   The book's central crime is a murder, which takes place before the
   novel opens. (This is an Asimovian trademark, which he attributed to
   his own squeamishness and John Campbell's advice of beginning as late
   in the story as possible.) The victim is Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer
   Ambassador who lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New
   York City. For some time, he has tried to convince the Earth government
   to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered
   outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York
   police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer, in
   cooperation with a highly advanced robot named R. Daneel Olivaw who is
   visually identical to a human and is equipped with a scanner that is
   able to detect human emotions through their encephalographic waves.
