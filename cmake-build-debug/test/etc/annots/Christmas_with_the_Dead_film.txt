   Strange electrical currents hurtle towards Earth from outer space.
   Calvin lives a typical life with his wife Ella and daughter Tina in the
   fictional East Texas town of Mud Creek It's during the holidays and one
   night Ella harasses him to put up Christmas decorations on their home.
   Instead Calvin naps on the couch and then a freak lightning storm from
   the strange electrical currents causes everyone who sees it to drop
   dead. When Calvin awakes he finds his wife and daughter seemingly dead.
   Awash with grief, he lays the two out on their bed. As soon as Calvin
   turns his back, his daughter rises from the dead and crawls out an open
   window. Then Ella rises as a zombie and attacks him. After he subdues
   her, his neighbor Ray shows up and tells Calvin Tina has bitten him and
   he had no choice but to kill her by striking her with a hammer. Soon
   Calvin realizes most of the inhabitants of Mud Creek are now
   zombies.

   Flash forward two years and Calvin has adapted to his lifestyle of
   living in a world full of the un-dead. He keeps his wife Ella chained
   up on the back porch of his house which is now a small fortress to keep
   the zombies at bay. He feeds Ella dog food in a dog bowl as he just
   can't bring himself to kill her for good. He transmits from the local
   radio station hoping someone will hear him, but it's to no avail. He
   even greets his former friend Ray, now a zombie after being bitten by
   Calvin's young daughter, as he drives away to run errands. He then runs
   into a man shooting zombies and dragging them to his pickup. The man at
   first thinks Calvin is a zombie and tries to shoot him. When Calvin
   asks the man what's he doing, he replies "Shooting the shit out of
   zombies". This is the first living human Calvin has seen in years. G.M.
   states his 3D glasses he always wears saved him from the effects of the
   storm. Calvin objects to G.M. shooting the zombies saying they are sick
   people. "These are my neighbors!" he replies. That night on G.M.'s
   roof, the two play loud music with a heavy beat and the zombies come
   pouring out of the woods and "dance" to the beat of the music.

   One day some former inmates from a state mental hospital hear Calvin's
   broadcast on their car radio. The inmates armed with handguns take
   Calvin and G.M. hostage and then to meet Reverend Mac who rules over
   the former inmates of the hospital, some of whom are clearly mentally
   ill, with the cult-like zeal of a Jim Jones. Now it's up to Calvin and
   G.M. to escape from both the Reverend and his flock of mentally
   deranged patients and the zombies as well.
