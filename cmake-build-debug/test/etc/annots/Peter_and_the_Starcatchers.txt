   In 19th century London, an orphaned boy named Peter and fellow orphans
   James, Thomas, Prentiss, and Tubby Ted are shipped out on the decrepit
   Never Land, under the command of First Mate Slank and the extremely
   incompetent Captain Cyrus Pembridge. A mysterious trunk is on board as
   well, identical to another that had been escorted by the Royal Guard
   onto Her Majesty's Wasp, another ship in harbor. Meanwhile, feared
   pirate Black Stache, captain of the Sea Devil hears of the trunk on the
   Wasp containing the greatest treasure of all time, and plots to capture
   it.

   While the Sea Devil dumps much of its weight and water in order to
   lighten the ship enough to run down The Wasp, Peter and the orphans
   attempt to adapt to their measly hold and Peter meets Molly Aster, a
   mysterious passenger of his own age. While scavenging for food one
   night, Peter finds himself in the hold where the trunk is guarded and
   is acquainted with a flying rat. Molly rescues him from crew members on
   their way to check out the commotion caused, and stories of the flying
   rat begin to travel through the ship, prompting Peter and Alf, a member
   of the crew, to wonder about the hold's contents.

   The Sea Devil manages to run down and board The Wasp, and Leonard
   Aster, Molly's father and a safekeeper of the trunk, fruitlessly
   attempts and fails to escape with the trunk in question. As The Wasp's
   crew is forced to surrender, Black Stache opens the trunk only to find
   sand, and both he and Aster realize that a switch had been made at port
   and the actual treasure is on the Never Land. Aster jumps overboard and
   escapes with his dolphin allies, who send a dolphin, Ammm, to relay to
   Molly that Black Stache was on his way. Molly later stops Peter and Alf
   from carrying out a plan to discover the contents of the trunk, and
   confides to Peter about the contents of the trunk: Starstuff, dust of
   extraordinary power that had fallen from the heavens, which had
   temporarily made the rat fly. Molly's family is revealed to be members
   of a secret society known as the Starcatchers, who located the
   Starstuff when it fell from the heavens and kept it out of the wrong
   hands. The contents of this particular trunk were the result of the
   largest fall in history, which had been located by a rival group, the
   Others, before the Starcatchers could acquire it. Molly enlists Peter
   to assist in throwing the trunk overboard before Black Stache arrived.

   Black Stache and his men rechristen the Wasp the Jolly Roger and race
   against a monster storm to intercept the Never Land and acquire the
   treasure. Attempting to dispose of the trunk with Molly, Peter is
   thrown overboard by Slank right before Black Stache and his men arrive
   and locate the trunk on the dock just as the storm hits. Having come
   into contact with Starstuff from the trunk, Peter manages to fly back
   and hurl the trunk overboard, prompting Black Stache to quickly leave
   and take Slank, sailor Little Richard, and Molly's governess prisoner.
   Molly jumps overboard to rescue Peter as his Starstuff wears off as Alf
   and the orphans escape the Never Land as the storm and nearby reef
   obliterate it. Both parties and the trunk wash up on a nearby island,
   with the Jolly Roger close behind.

   Alf, James, Prentiss, Thomas, Tubby Ted, and Peter are soon captured by
   the local natives, while Black Stache and a large posse search the
   island for the trunk, leaving the ship virtually unguarded while Slank
   and Little Richard break out of the Jolly Roger, subdue the remaining
   pirates, and search for the trunk. The natives, known as the Mollusks
   and led by Fighting Prawn, decide to feed the group to Mister Grin, an
   abnormally large crocodile who is kept captive in an enclosure, as is
   their policy when dealing with foreigners. Molly rescues them with some
   reserve starstuff, enabling the group and Mister Grin to fly out of the
   enclosure, causing mass panic among the Mollusks and pirate posse. The
   trunk is eventually found by Slank and Little Richard, who battle
   Mermaids (lagoon fish who came into contact with starstuff from the
   leaky trunk), trick the pirates, and knock Peter out, who is shortly
   rescued by the mermaids for healing one of their own from a wound
   inflicted by Slank.

   With help from Ammm, the group assaults Slank and Little Richard and
   nearly succeeds in overpowering both of them before Slank restrains
   Molly and reveals that he is in league with the Others, who are rivals
   of the Starcatchers and want the Starstuff for their own purposes. He
   confirms that a switch had been made in port and that the trunk of
   Starstuff was originally intended for the Wasp, and that both ships had
   been headed to Rundoon, where the starstuff was to be delivered to the
   corrupt King Zarboff III and the boys as palace servants. He and Little
   Richard take Molly hostage on their longboat in order to escape with
   the trunk, but Peter rescues Molly. It is then revealed that Peter had
   earlier lifted the box of Starstuff out of the trunk. He and Molly
   leave Slank and Little Richard to drift out to sea.

   Aster and a group of Starcatchers soon arrive on the Island,
   accompanied by ships of the British Navy, and Aster deduces that Peter
   should have died when lifting the box of Starstuff, but had an
   extraordinarily high tolerance to Starstuff and instantly stopped aging
   forever while permanently retaining the ability to fly. The Mollusks
   and the pirates converge on the group, and a fight ensures, wherein
   Fighting Prawn is mortally wounded and Peter manages to sever Black
   Stache's hand, which is eaten by Mister Grin. As the pirates flee to
   another part of the island, Peter uses the starstuff in Aster's locket
   to save Fighting Prawn, who spares the group, allows Molly, Aster, Alf,
   and the Starcatchers to leave the island with the now-secured box of
   Starstuff, and lets Peter, James, Thomas, Prentiss, and Tubby Ted stay
   on the island, as Peter feels that he wouldn't be able to fit in with
   society. As he and Molly bid farewell to one another, Aster uses
   starstuff to turn a local bird into a fairy, Tinker Bell, to watch over
   Peter. Peter promises to come to London in the near future to visit,
   and he and the boys begin to settle on the island. The story ends with
   Peter discovering a washed-up plank with the printed name of the Never
   Land, which he decides to nickname the island (although the sequels
   still refer to it by its given name, Mollusk Island).
