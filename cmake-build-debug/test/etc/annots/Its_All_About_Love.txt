   In the year 2021, when the earth is devastated by continuous climate
   changes, with sudden waves of frost (it snows in the middle of summer
   even in Venice), John, a university lecturer, traveling from Poland to
   Calgary, stops in New York, to sign divorce papers for his wife Elena.
   This is a beloved champion of ice skating followed by a very large
   entourage that takes care of her numerous commitments and all external
   relations.

   John is detained one night so he can see an important performance from
   Elena. The next morning he should leave but Elena not only does not
   sign the divorce papers but begs him to help her. She doesn't give much
   explanation but he, still in love, indulges her. John discovers that
   the young woman is the victim of a strange plot hatched by her own
   entourage. Three clones, perfectly identical to her, were made to
   replace her. Officially to relieve her of the burden of an activity
   that is getting heavier, but the fear is that once the training is
   over, the real Elena can be put aside.

   Between escapes and returns, the killing of the clones, the betrayal of
   his own family members, in the end John and Elena go away first by
   train then on foot towards a safe place to resume a new life together,
   but they face the cold storms that they are scourging much of the
   Earth, dying embraced.

   The narration of the finale is entrusted to Marciello, John's brother,
   who in flight over the planet is one of the last survivors but is also
   destined to perish as it is not possible to land.
