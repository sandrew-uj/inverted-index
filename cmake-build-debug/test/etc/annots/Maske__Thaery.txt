   Long ago, the isolated planet Maske was settled by a religious group.
   They seized a section of the planet from earlier colonists (the Djan),
   and named it Thaery. The ship carrying a dissident faction was attacked
   and crashed across the Long Ocean which encircles the planet. The
   survivors eventually reemerged as the Waels of Wellas. The members of
   another faction were exiled to the stony peninsula of Glentlin, where
   they became the Glints. The Glints became notorious bandits, but were
   eventually subjugated. However, they are still looked down upon as
   coarse and belligerent. Some Glints took to sailing, and as "Sea
   Nationals", claimed sovereignty over the ocean. The orthodox settlers
   divided Thaery into twelve prosperous cantons. Seeking to maintain
   their religious purity, the Thariots prohibited all travel to other
   worlds.

   Jubal Droad, a young Glint man, goes on Yallow, a rite of passage into
   adulthood, traditionally spent wandering the land and tending the
   countryside by doing public works. He recruits three Djan and spends
   several weeks repairing a trail by hauling rocks. One day, an arrogant
   Thariot leading a group of soldiers ignores Jubal's urgent warning to
   not use the still unfinished trail. He and his Djan escort use the
   path, causing it to collapse and seriously injure Jubal.

   When he recovers, his uncle Vaidro gives him a letter of introduction
   to Nai the Hever, one of the most powerful men of Thaery and urges his
   young relative to seek employment. He arrives in the coastal city of
   Wysrod and encounters Nai's elegant adult daughter Mieltrude and her
   beautiful friend Sune Mircea. He accompanies them to the examination of
   Ramus Ymph for a vacancy for the high office of Servant. Jubal
   recognizes his nemesis. During a recess, he informs Nai the Hever, the
   senior Servant, of the incident on the trail and Jubal's investigation
   of Ympg's activities that result in Ramus being rejected. Ramus, as
   Jubal has deduced, has secretly taken a spaceship off-world, breaking
   the laws of Thaery.

   On the strength of Vaidro's letter, Nai the Hever offers Jubal a
   seemingly lowly position as Sanitary Inspector in unit D3. Jubal
   reluctantly accepts and learns, during his training, that D3 is a cover
   story for the intelligence service. He has unwittingly become a secret
   agent. Nai the Hever is in fact the head of Thaery's intelligence
   service, and Jubal's uncle Vaidro worked with him before he retired.

   Ramus Ymph seeks revenge by inducing Mieltrude, his fiancee, into
   signing a warrant to subject Jubal to severe torture, including bone
   breaking. Jubal escapes from the thugs with the assistance of Shrack, a
   Sea National acquaintance and ship captain, and procures a warrant
   against Mieltrude. After a confrontation with Nai the Hever,
   Mieltrude's warrant is canceled.

   Jubal's first assignment is to discover what Ramus is plotting. He
   follows Ramus to the tourist world Eiselbar and learns that he is
   posing as a rug salesman and trying to raise enough money to purchase a
   space yacht.

   Back on Maske, Jubal is called away by a family crisis. Cadmus
   off-Droad, Jubal's illegitimate brother, has murdered Trewe, their
   older brother and head of the clan, asserting that he had been robbed
   of his rightful place. The clan gathers and brings Cadmus down in
   fierce fighting. However, Cadmus's masked chief accomplice escapes, and
   Jubal is certain that it is Ramus. Without proof though, Nai the Hever
   is unwilling to antagonize the powerful Ymph clan. In fact, Jubal
   infers that he has become an embarrassment to his superior.

   Nonetheless, Jubal investigates on his own and finds that Ramus is
   sailing across the ocean to meet with the Waels, a people who live in a
   barren, unproductive land and who have developed a deep spiritual
   connection with trees. Nai is uninterested, so Jubal is forced to use
   his own initiative. He pursues Ramus in Shrack's ship. Jubal takes
   Mieltrude into custody, using his warrant, and brings her along. As the
   voyage progresses, their mutual disdain for each other begins to
   weaken. Mieltrude informs Jubal that her engagement to Ramus was purely
   in order to aid her father's investigation of Ramus. Ramus's mistress,
   Sune, had forged Mieltrude's signature to the warrant against Jubal.

   Jubal finds Ramus negotiating with the tree-worshipping Waels for the
   use of their land in exchange for much-needed food and other resources.
   The Minie, leader of the Waels, allows a disguised Jubal to question
   Ramus. Jubal gets his evasive enemy to finally admit that he wants to
   construct large tourist resorts, run by his Eiselbar associates, in the
   Waels land. (Ramus had also wanted to lease Droad land for the same
   purpose, hence his support for Cadmus.) The Waels are greatly disturbed
   by the revelation and reject his proposal.

   They do something to Ramus which leaves him mute and strangely subdued,
   and insist that Shrack and Jubal take him back with them. During the
   return voyage, Ramus sprouts bark and leaves, to the awestruck horror
   of the others. When they reach Wysrod, Ramus runs off the ship, plants
   his feet in the soil, raises his arms, and to all intents and purposes,
   becomes a tree.

   Afterwards, Nai the Hever asks his daughter her opinion of Jubal. She
   admits that he is not unpleasant, for a Glint.
