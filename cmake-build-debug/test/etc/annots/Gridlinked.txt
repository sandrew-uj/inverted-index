     Followed by   The Line of Polity

   Gridlinked is Neal Asher's first novel, published by the Macmillan
   Publishers imprint Pan Books in 2001. It contains elements of the
   technological inventiveness of hard science-fiction with a more
   contemporary political plotline. The novel follows the exploits of
   Earth Central Security agent Ian Cormac, as he attempts to discover who
   or what is behind the destruction of the Runcible on a remote colony.
   Cormac drops an investigation into Polity separatists on Cheyne III,
   and takes the starship Hubris to the ruined world of Samarkand to
   directly oversee the investigation there. Having been directly
   "gridlinked" to the Polity A.I. network for too long, Cormac has been
   slowly losing his humanity, and takes the opportunity of this
   particular mission to disconnect and solve the mystery the
   old-fashioned way.
