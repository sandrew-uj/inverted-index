   The eponymous hero is born as a male nobleman in England during the
   reign of Elizabeth I. He undergoes a mysterious change of sex at the
   age of about 30 and lives on for more than 300 years into modern times
   without ageing perceptibly.

   As a teenage boy, the handsome Orlando serves as a page at the
   Elizabethan court and becomes "favourite" of the elderly queen. After
   her death he falls deeply in love with Sasha, an elusive and somewhat
   feral princess in the entourage of the Russian embassy. This episode,
   of love and ice skating against the background of the celebrated Frost
   Fair held on the frozen Thames River during the Great Frost of 1608,
   when "birds froze in mid air and fell like stones to the ground",
   inspired some of Virginia Woolf's most bravura writing:

     Great statesmen, in their beards and ruffs, despatched affairs of
     state under the crimson awning of the Royal Pagoda ... Frozen roses
     fell in showers when the Queen and her ladies walked abroad ... Near
     London Bridge, where the river had frozen to a depth of some twenty
     fathoms, a wrecked wherry boat was plainly visible, lying on the bed
     of the river where it had sunk last autumn, overladen with apples.
     The old bumboat woman, who was carrying her fruit to market on the
     Surrey side, sat there in her plaids and farthingales with her lap
     full of apples, for all the world as if she were about to serve a
     customer, though a certain blueness about the lips hinted the
     truth.^[7]

   The melting of the ice coincides with Sasha's unfaithfulness and sudden
   departure for Russia. The desolate Orlando returns to writing The Oak
   Tree, a long poem started and abandoned in his youth. He meets and
   hospitably entertains an invidious poetaster, Nicholas Greene, who
   proceeds to find fault with Orlando's writing. Later Orlando feels
   betrayed on learning that he has been lampooned in one of Greene's
   subsequent works. A period of contemplating love and life leads Orlando
   to appreciate the value of his ancestral stately home, which he
   proceeds to furnish lavishly. There he plays host to the populace.

   Ennui sets in and Orlando feels harassed by a persistent suitor, the
   tall and somewhat androgynous Archduchess Harriet, leading Orlando to
   look for a way to leave the country. He is appointed by King Charles II
   as ambassador to Constantinople. Orlando performs his duties well,
   until a night of civil unrest and murderous riots. He falls asleep for
   a period of days, and others cannot rouse him. Orlando awakens to find
   that he has metamorphosed into a woman - the same person, with the same
   personality and intellect, but in a woman's body. Although the narrator
   of the novel professes to be disturbed and befuddled by Orlando's
   change, the fictional Orlando complacently accepts the change. From
   here on, Orlando's amorous inclinations change frequently, although she
   stays biologically female.

   The now Lady Orlando covertly escapes Constantinople in the company of
   a Gypsy clan. She adopts their way of life until its essential conflict
   with her upbringing leads her to head home. Only on the ship back to
   England, with her constraining female clothes and an incident in which
   a flash of her ankle nearly results in a sailor's falling to his death,
   does she realise the magnitude of becoming a woman. She concludes it
   has an overall advantage, declaring "Praise God I'm a woman!" Back in
   England, Orlando is hounded again by the archduchess, who now reveals
   herself to be a man, the Archduke Harry. Orlando evades his marriage
   proposals. She goes on to switch gender roles, dressing alternately as
   a man and woman.

   Orlando engages energetically with life in the 18th and 19th centuries,
   holding court with great poets, notably Alexander Pope. Critic Nick
   Greene, apparently also timeless, reappears and promotes Orlando's
   writing, promising to help her publish The Oak Tree.

   Orlando wins a lawsuit over her property and marries a sea captain,
   Marmaduke Bonthrop Shelmerdine. Like Orlando, he is gender
   non-conforming, and Orlando attributes the success of their marriage to
   this similarity. In 1928, she publishes The Oak Tree, centuries after
   starting it, and wins a prize. In the novel's ending, Orlando's husband
   flies over the mansion in an aeroplane, which hovers above Orlando
   until Shelmerdine leaps to the ground. A stray bird flies over his head
   and Orlando exults, "It's the goose! The wild goose!" The novel ends on
   the final stroke of midnight on Thursday, Oct. 11, 1928 (the day the
   novel would be published).
