   The novel begins with Percy dreaming about Grover being hunted by a
   monster. He wakes on the last day of his 7th grade year, a peaceful
   year at Meriwether College Prep. There he has become friends with
   Tyson, a homeless child that the school has taken on as a form of
   charity. In gym class, during a game of dodgeball, Percy is attacked by
   a gang of Laestrygonians, but is saved by Tyson and Annabeth, who was
   on her way back to Camp Half-Blood after having dreams about the Camp
   in danger. The three take a magical taxi driven by the Graeae to Long
   Island. Upon reaching the camp, they see a group of campers lead by
   Clarisse LaRue battling a pair of Colchis bulls. Tyson is granted
   permission to move past the camp's boundary in order to save Percy once
   again. It is revealed that he is a baby Cyclops and a half brother of
   Percy, as he is also a son of Poseidon. An unknown enemy has weakened
   the protective walls of Camp Half-Blood by poisoning the tree of the
   demigod Thalia, leaving the campers vulnerable to future monster
   attacks. Camp counsellor Chiron is accused of poisoning the tree and
   fired, though the only evidence against him is that his father is
   Kronos. Before leaving, Chiron notes that only the Golden Fleece could
   save the camp.

   Due to his charm and skill with a sword, Tantalus becomes the new camp
   counselor. As a reward for winning the chariot race, Tantalus sends
   Clarisse LaRue to find the Golden Fleece and forbids anyone else from
   leaving camp without his permission. After having a talk with the god
   Hermes about the fate of his son Luke, Percy leaves camp with Annabeth
   and Tyson to find Grover. With the help of a hippocampus that Tyson
   names Rainbow, the trio reach the Princess Andromeda, a cruise ship
   filled with monsters and demigods that have allied with the titan
   Kronos. On the ship, they are captured by Luke Castellan, and learn
   that he is working to revive Kronos. The trio narrowly escapes on an
   emergency lifeboat, and take shelter in a hideout that Annabeth,
   Thalia, and Luke built as children. There, a hydra finds and attacks
   them, but they are saved by Clarisse on her ship the CSS Birmingham.

   Annabeth, Percy, and Tyson join Clarisse's quest and journey to the
   Bermuda Triangle (also known as Sea of Monsters). In order to enter the
   Sea of Monsters, the ship tries to pass between Charybdis and Scylla,
   who attack and destroy it. It appears that Tyson and Clarisse are
   killed in action, so Percy and Annabeth board a life raft and head to
   the nearest island. Like Odysseus, after travelling through the narrow
   strait that Charybdis and Scylla guarded, the two land on the island of
   the witch-queen Circe. Realizing she has turned dozens of men into
   guinea pigs, they escape on the famous Queen Anne's Revenge, a former
   pirate ship. Percy and Annabeth pass the Sirens, and Annabeth confesses
   her insecurities to Percy. They reach the island of Percy's half
   brother, the cyclops Polyphemus. Before journeying to the centre of the
   island, Percy and Annabeth meet Grover pretending to be a female
   cyclops to trick Polyphemus into not eating him. They also learn that
   Clarisse and Tyson are alive. They find the Golden Fleece and narrowly
   escape to the mainland while fighting Polyphemus. Percy gives the
   Golden Fleece to Clarisse as a token of friendship, as it was her
   quest. She takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood, but the others are soon
   captured by Luke Castellan. Percy manages to send a message to Camp
   Half-Blood in which Luke admits to poisoning the tree of Thalia. The
   elders see their mistake and reinstate Chiron as camp counsellor. When
   Luke finds out, he challenges Percy to a duel. As Luke was the best
   swordsman in camp before he left, he wins easily. As Luke is about to
   finish off Percy and the rest of the group, a group of centaurs called
   the Party Ponies, led by Chiron, appear and whisk the group to safety.
   The Golden Fleece is hung on the tree of Thalia, and the tree is cured.
   However, the Fleece's magic is too strong and resurrects Thalia,
   providing another possible demigod for the Great Prophecy.
