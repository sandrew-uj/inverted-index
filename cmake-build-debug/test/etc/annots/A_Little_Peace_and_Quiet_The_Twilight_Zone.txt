   While digging in her garden, harried housewife Penny unearths a wooden
   box containing a gold pendant in the shape of a sundial. She discovers
   that saying "Shut up" while wearing the pendant causes the entire world
   but herself to become frozen in time, and saying "Start talking" makes
   everything begin moving again. She uses this power to give herself
   much-needed reprieves from the demands of her dim-witted and hapless
   husband Russell and their four children: Janet and Susan, who are
   always fighting; Bertie, who is clumsy; and Russell Jr., who is always
   playing pranks. She also silences news programs about recent arms talks
   between the United States and the Soviet Union and moves door-to-door
   anti-nuclear weapons activists away from her house while they are
   frozen in time.

   One evening, the radio announces that nuclear missiles are heading for
   the United States from the Soviet Union. When the radio reveals that
   ICBMs have entered U.S. airspace, the terrified Penny freezes time,
   then leaves her house and walks through town. As she notices terrified
   people looking skyward, she looks up to see a Soviet nuclear missile
   frozen a few hundred feet in the air, nose down, and moments from
   impact.
