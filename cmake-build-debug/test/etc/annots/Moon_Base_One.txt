   Thousands of young people are terminally ill as a result of the
   radiation produced by the lunar structures destroyed in The Domes of
   Pico. In an attempt to determine whether the fall-out from the domes
   can have a curative effect on the disease a joint East-West mission is
   planned under the auspices of the newly formed United Nations
   EXploration Agency (UNEXA).

   The mission is commanded by Chris Godfrey, accompanied by American,
   Morrison 'Morrey' Kant and Russian Serge Smyslov. The 'patient' will be
   Tony Hale, from Aston near Birmingham (who goes on to feature in the
   rest of the series). The mission starts well, but is soon in trouble
   when a supply rocket crashes...
