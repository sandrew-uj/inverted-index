   Money tells the story of, and is narrated by, John Self, a successful
   director of adverts who is invited to New York City by Fielding
   Goodney, a film producer, to shoot his first film. Self is an
   archetypal hedonist and slob; he is usually drunk, an avid consumer of
   pornography and prostitutes, eats too much and, above all, spends too
   much, encouraged by Goodney.

   The actors in the film, which Self originally titles Good Money but
   which he eventually wants to rename Bad Money, all have some kind of
   emotional issue which clashes with fellow cast members and with their
   roles -- the principal casting having already been done by Goodney. As
   examples: the strict Christian Spunk Davis (whose name is intentionally
   unfortunate) is asked to play a drugs pusher; the ageing hardman Lorne
   Guyland has to be physically assaulted; the motherly Caduta Massi, who
   is insecure about her body, is asked to appear in a sex scene with
   Lorne, whom she detests.

   Self is stalked by "Frank the Phone" while in New York, a menacing
   misfit who threatens him over a series of telephone conversations,
   apparently because Self personifies the success Frank was unable to
   attain. Self is not frightened of Frank, even when he is beaten by him
   while on an alcoholic bender. (Self, characteristically, is unable to
   remember how he was attacked.) Towards the end of the book Self
   arranges to meet Frank for a showdown, which is the beginning of the
   novel's shocking denouement. Money is similar to Amis's
   five-years-later London Fields in having a major plot twist.

   Self returns to London before filming begins, revealing more of his
   humble origins, his landlord father Barry (who makes his contempt for
   his son clear by invoicing him for every penny spent on his upbringing)
   and pub doorman Fat Vince. Self discovers that his London girlfriend,
   Selina, is having an affair with Ossie Twain, while Self is likewise
   attracted to Twain's wife in New York, Martina. This increases Self's
   psychosis and makes his final downfall even more brutal.

   After Selina has plotted to destroy any chance of a relationship
   between him and Martina, Self discovers that all his credit cards have
   been blocked, and, after confronting Frank, the stars of film angrily
   claim that there is no film. It is revealed that Goodney had been
   manipulating him; all the contracts signed by Self were loans and
   debts, and Goodney fabricated the entire film. He is also revealed to
   be Frank. He supposedly chose Self for his behaviour on the first plane
   to America, where Goodney was sitting close to him. Felix, a bellhop,
   helps him escape the angry mob in the hotel lobby and fly back to
   England, only to discover that Barry is not Self's real father.

   Amis writes himself into the novel as a kind of overseer and confidant
   in Self's final breakdown. He is an arrogant character, but Self is not
   afraid to express his rather low opinion of Amis, such as the fact that
   he earns so much yet "lives like a student". Amis, among others, tries
   to warn Self that he is heading for destruction but to no avail. Felix
   becomes Self's only real friend in America and finally makes Self
   realise how much trouble he has: "Man, you are out for a whole lot of
   money."

   The novel's subtitle, "A Suicide Note", is clarified at the end of the
   novel. It is revealed that Barry Self is not John Self's father; his
   father is in fact Fat Vince. As such, John Self no longer exists.
   Hence, in the subtitle, Amis indicates that this cessation of John
   Self's existence is analogous to suicide, which of course, results in
   the death of the self. A Suicide Note could also relate to the novel as
   a whole, or money, which Self himself calls "suicide notes" within the
   novel.

   After learning that his father is Fat Vince, John realises that his
   true identity is that of Fat John, half-brother of Fat Paul. The novel
   ends with Fat John having lost all his money (if it ever existed), yet
   he is still able to laugh at himself and is cautiously optimistic about
   his future.
