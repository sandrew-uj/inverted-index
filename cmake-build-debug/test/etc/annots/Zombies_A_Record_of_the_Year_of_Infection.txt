   A short prologue explains that the story, notes and images were those
   of Dr. Robert Twombly and were found in a remote cabin in the township
   of Churchill, Manitoba. The notes detail an individual account of
   survival and escape after a mass-scale (presumably global) zombie
   outbreak, referred to as a 'Necrotic Infection', beginning around
   January 7, 2012, and lasting for approximately one year. The purported
   importance of the journal comes from both Twombly's artistry and his
   medical knowledge, which permitted him to document the zombie outbreak
   with a unique level of detail and candor.

   The author extensively utilizes a false document technique, mixing
   diary-style first person stream of consciousness narration, drawn and
   painted images detailing the world following an undead pandemic, as
   well as brief glimpses of 'found' objects such as newspaper clippings
   and official reports to generate the central narrative.

   Dr. Twombly, a haematology and oncology specialist in Seattle,
   Washington keeps a journal detailing events from January 5 until March
   28, 2012. At first the diary appears to be used for sketches of birds,
   but an entry on January 12 describes a pandemic of unknown cause
   overwhelming the entire city and much of the world beyond. Before the
   internet shut down, headlines referring to a sudden, critical infection
   affecting thousands worldwide show the scale of the unfolding
   catastrophe, destroying commerce and limiting travel. His office is
   beleaguered by thousands, all showing identical symptoms of an unknown,
   seemingly undetectable pathogen. As the sick begin to die they quickly
   reanimate, walking slowly, attempting to devour those around them still
   alive, and - to varying extents - exhibiting some behavior of their
   previous existences (one bashes a vending machine as he did when he was
   alive, and later a married couple - now zombies - hold hands as they
   walk). While tests confirm that the reanimated 'zombies' are clinically
   dead, Twombly talks at length about the limitations and strengths of
   the undead.

   Meeting other survivors, and after witnessing an infection and
   reanimation first-hand, Twombly makes his way northward. His initial
   suspicions relating to a new GM food additive made by chemical company
   Primodyne are explored, although evidence relating to its accumulated
   toxicity is inconclusive, although its sudden prevalence and
   bio-accumulative effect does provide a logical explanation for the
   speed of the global infection, as well as the infection occasionally
   affecting individuals who have not come into direct contact with the
   zombies.

   Twombly spends much time on a small, isolated bucolic inn called 'the
   Farm' with nineteen other survivors, although eventually he is forced
   to move even further northward after the Farm is overrun by zombies and
   burned down. Finally he finds the town of Churchill, Manitoba where
   nobody has had any interaction with the infected.

   His final entry indicates that the threat is apparently subsiding, with
   the town secure and partially fortified. The entry is, however, cut off
   mid-word with a slight spatter of blood.
