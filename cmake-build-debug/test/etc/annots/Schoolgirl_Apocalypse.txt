   When all the men in her small town turn into zombies and begin to
   attack the women, Japanese schoolgirl Sakura (Higarino) finds her life
   turned upside down. The trauma of witnessing the mass murder of her
   female friends and family members pushes her toward madness.

   Having few skills and armed only with her English textbook and a kyudo
   bow, she sets out to survive. Having visions of a red-headed boy named
   Billy (Max MacKenzie), a character from one of her books, drives her
   toward insanity and she begins to lose her grip on reality. She wanders
   about, narrowly escaping her own death, until she finds Aoi (Mai
   Tsujimoto), a woman who is both equipped and mentally ready to kill.
   But this woman is dangerous and, rather than support, offers violence
   and more punishment. Seeking the real-life version of Billy, Sakura
   must decide whether to survive and find the answers or give up and
   die.
