   Jake Hallman steps in front of a garbage truck, gets hit, and awakes on
   the Golden Road in the afterlife. The being greeting him (St. Brendan)
   at first appears to be Jesus ("You've got to be kidding," says Jake)
   and then an angel, and tells him every deceased person experiences the
   afterlife according to the expectations formed while alive. Most are
   incapable of leaving behind their preconceptions; Jake, evidently, is
   one of the rare "free souls" capable of change.

   As such, Jake rejects Brendan's offer to escort him to Heaven, as well
   as the sales pitch of Brendan's demonic counterpart Mala in favor of
   Hell. Instead, having always fancied Norse mythology, he takes the
   rainbow bridge to Valhalla. At first finding it interesting, he
   eventually realizes its inhabitants are locked in an endless series of
   revels as they wearily await a Ragnarok that never comes. There Jake
   meets Freya (not the goddess), a Valkyrie who has also been having
   doubts about her native afterlife. Together the two undertake a quest
   on behalf of Odin to rescue the god's son Baldur from Hel, the Norse
   underworld.

   Their quest fails; Hel, queen of Hel, refuses to release Baldur, while
   the latter, secretly in love with his captor, does not really want to
   leave. On their way back from the underworld, Jake and Freya
   inadvertently trigger Ragnarok when they encounter Sigyn and disrupt
   her age-old mission to relieve the suffering of her husband, the god
   Loki. The Twilight of the Gods plays then out in the manner foretold in
   myth, destroying the Norse cosmos. In the aftermath, Brendan and Mala,
   who had teamed up to monitor the situation, find themselves tapped to
   become the first human couple on the renewed Midgard, while Jake and
   Freya become deities.

   In the course of the narrative a hydra-headed demiurge known as the
   Accountant keeps track of Jake and Freya's various revelations and
   shepherds them into their new roles.
