   Set in the near future when a scientific principle has been discovered
   allowing exceptionally accurate predictions of solar flares and the
   occurrence of the Sun increasing its solar output. Applying this
   principle, worldwide consensus has determined which day, hour, and
   minute the Sun will brighten so much as to boil away the Earth's seas.
   Realizing that the heightened insolation will destroy life as we know
   it, the world's nations debate what to do when the Sun "goes off."
   Since the Earth's rotation continues at 360 degrees in 24 hours, it
   will take only one day to cause all of the Earth's oceans to boil away.
   Terrific hurricanes and tidal waves will also occur, causing all
   buildings to be destroyed. If there are any survivors, they will be in
   hardened bunkers deep underground, and they will only be able to last
   as long as their food lasts.

   The unavoidability of the impending doom has caused some
   technologically advanced countries to look for sanctuary on another
   planet, such as Mars.

   This is all scheduled to happen in a few years, and the exact minute
   and hour of the Sun's increase in radiance does not give the human race
   much time to devise a way of navigating space to an orbit as far away
   as Mars.

   Nevertheless, massive building programs are initiated, and hundreds of
   spaceships are raised, many of them unfit for flight.

   A series of national lotteries are established with grand prize being a
   ticket to ride a spaceship off the Earth, and possibly make it as far
   as Mars. Many spaceships, however, were built without landing gear.
   Although many ships were supposed to have shortwave radios to
   communicate with each other, many of the shortwave radios were simply
   empty cases as the tubes and wires had been left out.

   The protagonist of the story has been elected into a position of
   authority, and must choose which people to take with him to Mars. He
   has only a limited number of tickets, and knows there will come a time
   when people with guns will storm their way on board, rather than stand
   in line until the tickets are depleted. The book is titled "One in
   Three Hundred" because only one in three hundred people in the United
   States will get a ticket to leave the Earth, and there is still a
   question whether the spaceships will have enough air, or even be able
   to travel to Mars in time, and nobody is certain whether the atmosphere
   of Mars is breathable, or whether Mars will even be habitable when they
   get there.
