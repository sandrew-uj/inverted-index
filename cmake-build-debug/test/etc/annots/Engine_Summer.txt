   The novel takes the form of an oral history told by a young man named
   "Rush that Speaks" and of his wandering through a strange,
   post-apocalyptic world in pursuit of several seemingly incompatible
   goals. Each of the four divisions of his story are recorded on a
   separate crystal, and chapters correspond to facets of each crystal.

   The story is set in a post-technological future; the present age is
   dimly remembered in story and legend, but without nostalgia or regret.
   The people of Rush's world are engaged in living their own lives in
   their own cultures. Words and artifacts from current time survive into
   Rush's age, suggesting that it is only a few millennia in the future.
   Yet there are hints that human society and even human biology are
   significantly changed. Even such basics as reproduction and eating have
   been altered, one by industrial-age genetic tampering, the other by
   contact with extraterrestrial life.

   Rush comes of age in Little Belaire, a mazelike village of invisible,
   shifting boundaries, of secret paths and meandering stories and antique
   bric-a-brac carefully preserved in carved chests. The inhabitants are
   divided into clans called "cords" based on personality traits. Over the
   centuries, the people of Little Belaire have perfected an art which
   they call "truthful speaking": communication so clear and accurate, so
   "transparent", as to leave no potential for deception or
   misunderstanding. Perhaps as a result of this practice, Little Belaire
   appears to be free of any violence or even serious competition. Another
   result of truthful speaking is the existence of the "saints", those
   whose stories speak not only of the specifics of their own lives, but
   about the human condition. Yet even with the benefit of truthful
   speaking, secrets and mysteries remain.

   Rush's journey is set in motion when the girl he loves, Once a Day,
   elopes from Little Belaire to join another group, an enigmatic society
   called Dr. Boots's List. In his search for her, Rush befriends a hermit
   and an "avvenger" and shares the secrets of the List. Ultimately he
   discovers a transparent sainthood stranger than any story told by the
   gossips of Little Belaire.
