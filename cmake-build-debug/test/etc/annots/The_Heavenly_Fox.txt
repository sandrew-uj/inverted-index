   By stealing the chi of humans a fox spirit may survive one thousand
   years, at which age it may achieve true immortality. The fox vixen
   Springshadow has nearly attained that prize, taking the guise of a
   beautiful girl down the centuries and using the life force of her
   lovers. None took any permanent harm from it, but her latest lover, Zou
   Xiaofan, is deathly ill, and by demanding she "prove" her love for him
   at such a time forces her to choose between her immortality and his
   life. While fond of him in her own way, for Springshadow there is
   really only one choice. She makes it, and he dies.

   Now immortal, Springshadow finds herself dissatisfied, plagued by a
   vague sense of regret she fears may blossom into an actual conscience.
   Traveling to Heaven, she quickly finds it unsatisfactory, better than
   but otherwise little different from Earth. She locates and converses
   with Sunflash, another immortal fox, and learns that he too failed to
   find contentment and is preparing to give up his status. He has only
   waited as long as he has in order to pass to the next fox to achieve
   immortality (her) his insight into its secret; that it is, in fact,
   worthless, and that true advancement can only come by returning to the
   wheel of rebirth.

   A message from her dead lover's shade conveyed to her by Guan Shi Yin,
   goddess of mercy, convinces Springfox she might exorcize her
   inconvenient feelings by redeeming Zou Xiaofan's soul. By means of
   Heaven's efficient bureaucracy she discovers it is located in the Hell
   of Hungry Ghosts, to which she travels in the company of her longtime
   friend Wildeye, a Daoist reprobate who has also achieved immortality.
   Enlisting the aid of the demons there by bribing them with liquor, they
   finally locate Zou Xiaofan and with the aid of Guan Shi Yin free him
   from the torment to which he has mistakenly condemned himself.

   After resolving this unfinished business, Springfox comes to her own
   conclusion on the secret of immortality.
