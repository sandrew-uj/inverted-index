   The game is set after a fictional World War III, the events of which
   have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to
   fight for survival. Some of the survivors have formed gangs, some
   turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil
   militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders.
   Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey
   on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and
   killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels from town
   to town in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's
   survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her
   armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to
   defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel
   finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen
   traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches
   Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of
   the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople
   re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city
   of New Dallas. Recognizing the voice on the other end, the receiving
   operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx.
   Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that
   she must join him in New Dallas.

   Shortly after arriving, the city is forced to rally all of its
   survivors, including Angel and Ekx, in order to fend off an incoming
   attack from the Renegades. The two friends become separated during
   the fighting, but not before Ekx gives a mysterious book to Angel.
   After making her way to the city of Highwall, Angel encounters
   Wastelanders worshipping a mystic that claims the earth was not
   destroyed by nuclear war, but by a "crack in the universe." Angel
   is skeptical of these claims, although Ekx believes her to be the
   deliverer. After receiving a mission from Ekx, Angel heads through
   the badlands, north, to a survivor camp. Despite rumors that the
   place may be flooded, the game ends as Angel heads to New York to find
   out why Ekx has entrusted her with the mysterious book.
