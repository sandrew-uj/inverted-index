   The Mote in God's Eye (originally titled Motelight) is set in
   Pournelle's CoDominium universe, where a union of the United States and
   the Soviet Union produced a world government and a number of colonies
   in other star systems, followed by nuclear war on Earth and the rise of
   the First Empire based on the planet Sparta several centuries before
   the events of the novel. There is a reference to these events in
   Pournelle's novel King David's Spaceship.

   Many, but not all, humans are part of the Second Empire, held together
   by an interstellar navy modeled on 19th century British lines, with
   all-male crews, a highly competent officer corps grown from midshipmen
   recruited in their teens and trained on the job, and well-armed and
   -organized Marines to carry out ground missions. Those who prove
   themselves worthy can be promoted into the aristocracy. The aristocrats
   themselves tend more towards duty than privilege. The Empire is
   predominantly Christian, but other religions are more or less
   tolerated. The people of the planet Dayan are Jewish, while Horace Bury
   is a Muslim business magnate from Levant. An upstart religion, the
   "Church of Him", which was founded when the Mote became intensely
   bright and was regarded as part of the Face of God, is shown in
   decline, its founder having committed suicide when the light from the
   Mote went out.
