   On September 28, 1998, 24 hours prior to the events of Resident Evil 2,
   former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member Jill
   Valentine attempts to escape from Raccoon City. Most of the population
   has been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new
   type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical
   company Umbrella. On her way to the Raccoon City Police Department,
   Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers, who is killed by a new
   enemy. This creature, Nemesis-T Type, is a bio-organic weapon
   programmed to target surviving S.T.A.R.S. members, witnesses of
   Umbrella's experiments. As she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three
   surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service
   (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor, and Nikolai Zinoviev.
   Nikolai explains to Jill and Carlos that a rescue helicopter can be
   contacted if they manage to reach the city's Clock Tower and ring the
   bell.

   As they make their way to the tower, Nikolai is presumed dead, while
   Nemesis corners the remaining members of the group on the cable car
   headed to the tower. Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing
   the car to crash into the tower's main courtyard and separating Jill
   and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by
   ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis,
   which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill
   manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the
   T-virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock
   Tower. Three days later, he finds a vaccine for Jill's T-virus
   infection in a nearby hospital. He then returns and administers it to
   Jill, saving her.

   After she regains consciousness, Jill proceeds towards the Raccoon Park
   and enters the park caretaker's cabin. There, she runs into Nikolai,
   who reveals that he is a "supervisor" sent into Raccoon City to gather
   combat data of Umbrella's bioweapons. Nikolai retreats, and Jill is
   confronted by a massive worm-like creature. Jill defeats the creature
   and escapes to an abandoned factory at the rear of the park. Inside the
   factory, Jill meets up with Carlos, who tells her that the U.S.
   government is planning to launch a nuclear missile into Raccoon City to
   eradicate the T-virus infestation. After confronting Nemesis and
   grabbing a keycard needed to escape, Jill learns from the factory's
   control tower that the missile attack on Raccoon City has begun, with
   only a short time left before the city is destroyed.

   Depending on the path taken by the player, Jill's final encounter with
   Nikolai will differ. In one version of the events, Nikolai will attempt
   to start a gunfight with Jill, only to be taken by surprise by Nemesis
   and killed. In another event, Nikolai will hijack Jill's intended
   escape chopper, and the player must choose to either reason with
   Nikolai or destroy the helicopter. If Jill negotiates with Nikolai, he
   reveals that he has killed the other supervisors and boasts about
   collecting the bounty placed on Jill by Umbrella before escaping.
   Regardless of Nikolai's fate, Jill makes her way to the rear yard and
   confronts Nemesis one last time. After an intense battle, Jill defeats
   Nemesis with the help of a prototype railgun before meeting up with
   Carlos and escaping the city via a helicopter. If the previous escape
   chopper was stolen by Nikolai, Jill and Carlos will instead meet up
   with S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team's weapons specialist Barry Burton, who helps
   them escape in his helicopter. The nuclear missile vaporizes Raccoon
   City, and Jill swears revenge on Umbrella. A newscast then briefly
   details the destruction, and offers condolences for the lost lives.
