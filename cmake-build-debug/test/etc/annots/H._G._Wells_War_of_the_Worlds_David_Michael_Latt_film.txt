   On the surface of Mars, the Mars Rover is destroyed by an unknown
   force. Astronomer George Herbert (Howell) and his wife Felicity (Van
   Wyk Loots) are packing for a trip to Washington, D.C. to celebrate
   their 10th wedding anniversary. George's son Alex tries to spot Mars
   through his telescope, but actually discovers a meteorite entering
   Earth's atmosphere. George is called to work about the incident, and
   his wife and son leave early for Washington without him. As he drives
   to work, a crashing meteorite disrupts all technology in the area. An
   alien "walker" emerges from the meteorite and massacres the witnesses
   with an energy weapon, George barely escaping with his life. George
   decides to meet with his younger brother Matt in Hopewell before moving
   on to Washington.

   Despite rumors that Washington has suffered some of the worst of the
   invasion thus far, George continues his journey and meets with Sgt.
   Kerry Williams, the last remaining member of his squad. George and
   Kerry meet with Lt. Samuelson, a power-mad soldier with unrealistic
   notions of resistance against the invaders, who rejects George and
   Kerry as cowards. In Hopewell, the aliens launch a heavy insurrection
   and George and Kerry find Matt dying in the trail of destruction.
   George is separated from Kerry in the confusion and escapes the attack.
   A priest, Victor, finds George and describes his belief that the
   invasion is a form of the Rapture. The two go on together towards
   Washington. Victor's faith in Christianity is deeply shaken when a
   hysterical former member of his church curses God for the death of her
   young children. George and Victor witness the final effort of the
   military to fight off the walkers who are overwhelmed as the aliens
   begin using chemical weapons to disperse their opposition.

   The two seek refuge in the abandoned house of a veterinarian for food
   and medical supplies when the neighborhood is flattened by another of
   the aliens' ships. Hiding in the house's ruins deep in the aliens'
   camp, Victor concludes that God has abandoned them, and rejects his
   religion altogether. Rations become sparse and the aliens begin
   harvesting humans. George finds rabies vaccines with the hope that it
   can spread among the aliens and give them a chance to escape. Victor
   regains his faith after George successfully infects one of the aliens,
   only for it to kill Victor and leave. George realizes after a few days
   that the aliens have left the area and he continues his journey on foot
   to Washington. George reunites with Kerry and Samuelson, who has made
   himself a general and is building a resistance under his own
   dictatorship. Samuelson senselessly murders Kerry, and George in turn
   murders Samuelson.

   George finally reaches Washington, which is completely destroyed. He
   offers his life to the aliens, but finds that they are all dead. A
   handful of human survivors emerge and reveal to George that the aliens
   have been dying from a virus. George finds Felicity and Alex alive.
