   The native protagonist, Barlennan, captain of the sailing raft Bree, is
   on a trading expedition to the equator. Prior to the story's opening, a
   human scientific probe has become stranded at one of the planet's
   poles, where the gravity is too strong to effect a rescue. A member of
   the scientific team, Charles Lackland, is dispatched to the equator
   where he has met Barlennan by chance. Even machine aided, Lackland is
   barely able to function in the 3 G environment, one Barlennan considers
   incredibly light and a tiny fraction of what his culture is used to.

   Lackland teaches the Bree crew English and arranges a deal with
   Barlennan; in exchange for the humans providing warnings of the violent
   weather which often plagues trips to the pole, Barlennan will retrieve
   the probe and return it to the equator where it can be picked up.
   Communication is achieved through an audio-visual radio built to
   function in a high-gravity environment, which is treated as magical by
   other intelligences encountered on the planet.

   Along the way to the pole, the ship encounters and overcomes a variety
   of obstacles, some of which the humans help with using their superior
   scientific knowledge, and some of which rely on the cunning of
   Barlennan and his crew. They are captured by various lifeforms similar
   to themselves, but who live in the lower-gravity areas and have
   developed projectile weapons and gliders. Gradually, with human help,
   they gain an understanding of these and manage to escape.

   Barlennan has been dissatisfied with the humans' efforts to seemingly
   avoid explanation of anything scientific, and almost withholds the
   probe when they finally reach it; but the humans convince them that a
   scientific background is needed to understand the advanced equipment in
   the probe, and a deal is reached whereby the humans will educate the
   Mesklinites.

   The novel provides an exposition on how the weather, geology and
   atmosphere of the seas and the pole are affected by the local
   conditions, and sees the Mesklinites overcoming their fear of gravity
   as they learn to view it scientifically, eventually harnessing
   aerodynamics to make the Bree fly at the poles.
