   Clayton Riddell, a struggling artist from Maine, has just landed a
   graphic novel deal in Boston when "The Pulse", a signal sent out over
   the global cell phone network, suddenly turns every cell phone user
   into a mindless zombie-like killer. Clay is standing in Boston Common
   when the Pulse hits, causing chaos to erupt around him. Civilization
   crumbles as the "phoners" attack each other and anyone in view.

   Amidst the chaos, Clay is thrown together with middle-aged Thomas
   McCourt and teenager Alice Maxwell; the trio escapes to Tom's suburban
   home as Boston burns. The next day, they learn the "phoners" have begun
   foraging for food and banding together. Clay is still determined to
   return to Maine and reunite with his young son, Johnny. Having no
   better alternatives, Tom and Alice come with him. They trek north by
   night across a devastated New England, having fleeting encounters with
   other survivors and catching disturbing hints about the activities of
   the phoners, who still attack non-phoners on sight.

   Crossing into New Hampshire, they arrive at the Gaiten Academy, a prep
   school with one remaining teacher, Charles Ardai, and one surviving
   pupil, Jordan. The pair show the newcomers where the local phoner flock
   goes at night: they pack themselves into the Academy's soccer field and
   "switch off" until morning. It is clear the phoners have become a hive
   mind and are developing psychic abilities. The five survivors decide
   they must destroy the flock and, using two propane tankers, they
   succeed in doing so.

   Clay tries to get everyone to flee the scene, but the others refuse to
   abandon the elderly Ardai. That night, all of the survivors share the
   same horrific dream: each dreamer sees himself in a stadium, surrounded
   by phoners, as a disheveled man wearing a Harvard University hooded
   sweatshirt approaches, bringing their death. Waking, the heroes share
   their frightening dream experiences and dub him "the Raggedy Man". A
   new flock surrounds their residence, and the "normies" face the flock's
   metaphorical spokesman: the man in the Harvard hoodie. The flock kills
   other normals in reprisal and orders the protagonists to head north to
   a spot in Maine called "Kashwak". To stop their main objection, the
   flock psychically compels Ardai to commit suicide. Clay and the others
   bury him and travel north, as Clay is still determined to go home.

   En route, they learn that as "flock-killers" they have been psychically
   marked as untouchables, to be shunned by other normies. Following a
   petty squabble on the road, Alice is killed by a loutish pair of
   normies. The group buries her and arrives in Clay's hometown of Kent
   Pond, where they discover notes from Johnny which tell them Clay's
   estranged wife Sharon was turned into a phoner, but their son survived
   for several days, before he and the other normies were prompted by the
   phoners to head to the supposedly cell phone-free Kashwak. Clay has
   another nightmare which reveals that once there, the normie refugees
   were all exposed to the Pulse. He remains intent on finding his son,
   but after meeting another group of flock-killers, Tom and Jordan decide
   to avoid the ceremonial executions the phoners have planned. Before
   separating, the group discovers that Alice's murderers were psychically
   compelled into a gruesome suicide act for touching an untouchable.

   Clay sets off alone, but the others soon reappear driving a small
   school bus; the phoners have used their ever-increasing psychic powers
   to force them to rejoin him. One of the flock-killers, construction
   worker Ray Huizenga, surreptitiously gives Clay a cell phone and a
   phone number, telling him to use them when the time is right; Ray then
   commits suicide. The group arrives at Kashwak, the site of a
   half-assembled county fair, where increasing numbers of phoners are
   beginning to behave erratically and break out of the flock. Jordan
   theorizes that a computer program caused the Pulse and that, while it
   is still broadcasting into the battery-powered cell phone network, it
   has become corrupted with a computer worm that has infected the newer
   phoners with a mutated Pulse. Nevertheless, an entire army of phoners
   is waiting for them and Clay notices Sharon is among them. The phoners
   lock the group in the fair's exhibition hall for the night; tomorrow is
   the ceremonial execution to be psychically broadcast to all phoners and
   remaining normies in the world.

   As Clay awaits their morning execution, he sees Ray's unspoken plan:
   Ray had filled the rear of the bus with explosives, wired a
   phone-triggered detonator to them and killed himself to prevent the
   phoners from telepathically discovering the explosives. The group
   breaks a window for Jordan to squeeze through and he drives the vehicle
   into the midst of the inert phoners. Thanks to a jury-rigged cell phone
   patch set up by the pre-Pulse fair workers, Clay is able to detonate
   the bomb and wipe out the Raggedy Man and his flock.

   The majority of the group heads into Canada, to let the approaching
   winter wipe out the region's unprotected and leaderless phoners. Clay
   heads south, seeking his son. He finds Johnny, who received a
   "corrupted" Pulse; he wandered away from Kashwak and seems to almost
   recognize his father. However, Johnny is an erratic shadow of his
   former self and so, following another theory of Jordan's, Clay decides
   to give Johnny another blast from the Pulse, hoping the increasingly
   corrupted signal will cancel itself out and reset his son's brain. The
   book ends with Clay dialing and placing the cell phone to Johnny's ear.
