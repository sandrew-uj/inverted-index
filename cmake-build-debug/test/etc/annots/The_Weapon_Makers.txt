   The Weapon Makers is a science fiction novel by Canadian writer A. E.
   van Vogt.

   The novel was originally serialized in Astounding Science Fiction from
   February to April 1943. The serial version was first published in book
   form in 1947 with a print run of 1,000 copies. It was then thoroughly
   revised in 1952. All subsequent printings contain the 1952 text.

   The events in the novel take place approximately seven years after the
   events described in The Weapon Shops of Isher (1951) even though the
   serial was published before some of the other Isher stories contained
   in The Weapon Shops of Isher. The first paperback edition, part of an
   Ace Double, was retitled One Against Eternity.
