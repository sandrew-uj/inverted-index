   The introduction to the book says:

     The seeds of the Little War were planted in a restless summer during
     the mid-1960s, with sit-ins and student demonstrations as youth
     tested its strength. By the early 1970s, over 75 percent of the
     people living on Earth were under twenty-one years of age. The
     population continued to climb--and, with it, the youth percentage.
     In the 1980s, the figure was 79.7 per cent. In the 1990s, 82.4 per
     cent. In the year 2000--critical mass.

   In the world of 2116, a person's maximum age is strictly legislated: 21
   years, to the day. When people reach this Lastday they report to a
   Sleepshop in which they are willingly executed via a pleasure-inducing
   toxic gas. A person's age is revealed by their palm flower crystal
   embedded in the palm of their right hand that changes color every seven
   years; yellow (age 0-6), then blue (age 7-13), then red (age 14-20),
   then blinks red and black on Lastday, and finally turns black at 21.

   Runners are those who refuse to report to a Sleepshop and attempt to
   avoid their fate by escaping to Sanctuary--a place where they can live
   freely in defiance of society's dictates. Logan 3 is a Deep Sleep
   Operative (also called a Sandman) whose job is to terminate Runners
   using a special weapon called simply 'the gun', a handgun with
   selectable ordnance keyed to self-destruct if touched by an individual
   who is not the proper owner. Runners are most terrified of a weapon
   called the 'Homer', which homes in on body heat and ignites every pain
   nerve in the body, killing the target.

   Sandmen practice Omnite, a hybrid type of martial arts. On his own
   Lastday, Logan becomes a Runner himself in an attempt to infiltrate an
   apparent underground railroad for runners seeking Sanctuary.

   For most of the book, Logan is an antihero; however, his character
   develops a sympathy towards Runners, and he becomes more of a
   traditional hero figure.

   Despite her initial distrust of him, he is aided by Jessica 6, a
   contact that Logan made after he chased her Runner brother, Doyle 10,
   into Cathedral, where he was killed by the vicious, pre-teens known as
   "Cubs".

   Francis, another Sandman, and friend of Logan, catches up with Logan
   and Jessica after they have managed to make it to the final-staging
   area before Sanctuary. Francis reveals that his true identity is that
   of the legendary Ballard, who has been helping arrange their escape.
   Francis tells them he is actually aged 42, but due to his faulty palm
   flower, which does not change color, and through use of plastic-surgery
   shops, he has been able to disguise his true age and appearance. He is
   working from within the system, as he believes the computer controlling
   the global infrastructure, buried beneath Crazy Horse Mountain, is
   beginning to malfunction, and that society will die with it.

   Sanctuary turns out to be Argos, a previously abandoned space colony
   near Mars.

   Logan and Jessica escape to the colony on a rocket, which departs from
   a former space program launch site in Florida, while Ballard remains to
   help others escape.
