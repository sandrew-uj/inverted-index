   One year after the Buggers (Formics) were defeated and the Battle
   School children have returned to Earth, Ender is still unable to return
   with them because there would be wars over which country would keep
   Ender to use for its own ends. Ender is offered the Governorship of the
   first human colony to be planted on one of the Buggers' former worlds,
   a planet that will eventually become known as Shakespeare. His sister
   Valentine decides to accompany Ender on his journey because she is sick
   of being controlled by her older brother, Peter, and because she wants
   to restore the relationship with Ender that she had lost when he left
   to go to Battle School.

   On their way to the Shakespeare colony, Valentine begins writing her
   History of the Bugger Wars books while Ender has an unspoken power
   struggle with the Captain of the ship, Admiral Quincy Morgan. There is
   also a romance between Ender and a girl named Alessandra. Once the ship
   lands on Shakespeare, Ender, who had spent much of his trip learning
   the names and lives of the colony's residents, takes charge of the
   colony and wins the colonists over.

   Ender resides as Governor for a few years in Shakespeare. Near the end
   of his time as governor, Ender and a young boy from the colony named
   Abra go to find a site for a new shipment of colonists. Ender wants the
   new settlement to be far enough away from the other settlements that
   there will not be competition between them right away, and so they can
   develop separately.

   In the process of finding a location for new settlement, Ender stumbles
   upon what seems to be the equivalent of a note from the Buggers. It is
   a structure made to look like a game he used to play in Battle School.
   When Ender goes to investigate the structure, he finds the living pupa
   of a Bugger Hive Queen that is fertilized and prepared to make hundreds
   of thousands of offspring upon its own maturation.

   The find leads Ender to write his first book as the Speaker for the
   Dead. The book, titled The Hive Queen, tries to look at the Bugger wars
   and their eventual destruction from the point of view of the Buggers.
   Later, Peter Wiggin, nearing the end of his life and knowing that Ender
   wrote the story, asks him to write one for him for when he dies. This
   book becomes known as The Hegemon.

   After this, Ender resigns as Governor of Shakespeare and leaves the
   colony for another called Ganges. The leader of Ganges is Virlomi. Here
   he encounters Randall Firth who believes himself to be the son of
   Achilles de Flandres, and even refers to himself by the name Achilles.

   Randall spreads propaganda accusing Ender of Xenocide in an attempt to
   discredit Virlomi and get revenge against Peter Wiggin, who he believes
   is responsible for his father's defeat. Randall tries twice to meet
   with Ender and discredit him somehow. On the second visit his plan is
   to cleverly provoke Ender into killing him so that people will see how
   violent and dangerous he is, but Ender does not attack.

   Instead Ender tries to convince Randall that he is not Achilles' son,
   but that he is in fact the son of Bean and Petra; hence where he gets
   his gigantism from. Eventually, Ender manages to convince Randall of
   his parents' identity by allowing Randall to brutally defeat him in a
   one-sided fistfight, the entire time asserting that he could never hurt
   his friends' child. Randall ends up changing his name to Arkanian
   Delphiki amidst his guilt for Ender's horrifying wounds.

   After Ender heals a bit, he, Valentine, and the Hive Queen pupa board a
   star ship to go to a new place.^[3]
