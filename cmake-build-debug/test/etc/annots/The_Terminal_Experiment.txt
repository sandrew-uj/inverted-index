   The novel takes place in Toronto, briefly in 1995 and chiefly in 2011.
   Dr. Peter Hobson, a biomedical engineer, has invented many devices in
   the field of home automation. He has always been haunted by memories of
   monitoring an EKG during the dissection of a "corpse" for organ
   donation when he was in graduate school; the donor's heart was still
   beating and the body exhibited signs of anesthesia awareness. Now,
   Peter devises what he calls a superEEG in order to determine the exact
   moment when all electrical energy ceases in the brain; he wants to
   precisely "determine that someone is dead before they begin carving out
   his organs."

   Peter is hurt and angry when his beloved wife, Cathy, admits that she
   had sex with Hans Larsen, whom neither of them respects. A
   psychotherapist helps her to understand that she has low self-esteem
   because of emotional neglect by her critical father Rod. Peter throws
   himself into his work. This is the emotional set-up that drives events
   in the following five months.

   To his shock, when Peter places his superEEG on the head of a willing
   terminal patient, he afterwards finds in the readouts a small
   electrical field leaving the brain after death. He shares this
   discovery with his friend Sarkar Muhammed, who runs his own startup
   firm doing expert system design. Sarkar declares it a soul, which
   Peter, a skeptic, is reluctant to believe. To maintain precise
   scientific language, they call it a soulwave: "The soulwave had a
   distinctive electrical signature. The frequency was very high, well
   above that of normal electrochemical brain activity, so, even though
   the voltage was minuscule, it wasn't washed out in the mass of other
   signals within the brain."

   Peter experiments with more terminal patients to verify his finding; he
   tests pregnant women to discover when the fetus gains a soulwave (at
   about ten weeks); and he finds that, among animals, at least
   chimpanzees also have souls.

   When Peter holds a press conference to announce his breakthrough, human
   society around the world undergoes a revolution. He is repeatedly asked
   what life after death is like, though he has no idea.

     "I can't rely on the Koran, or the Bible, or anything else. All we
     know is that a cohesive energy field survives the death of the body.
     Whether that field lasts for any appreciable time after departure,
     or whether it carries any real information, is completely
     unknown--and any other interpretation at this point is just wishful
     thinking."

   In order to learn about immortality and life after death, Peter and
   Sarkar create three electronic simulations of Peter's own personality
   after a comprehensive scan of his mind and memories. From one, they
   seek "which neural nets are activated exclusively by biological
   concerns, and then zero those out" (p. 131), so that it is purely
   intellect; they call it Spirit. From the second, they edit all fears of
   aging and death, so that it "feels" itself to be immortal; they call
   this one Ambrotos. The third is a control, with Peter's knowledge up to
   the point of the brain scan. At first, the three "sims" enjoy exploring
   all that the Internet has to offer. One sim, however, hires a hit man
   to kill Hans and then, days later, Cathy's father.

   Detective Sandra Philo takes the case and, questioning Cathy and her
   co-workers, realizes at once that Cathy is concealing her relationship
   with Hans. She also knows Peter is rich enough to afford hiring a
   professional hit. What she doesn't realize is that the guilty sim is
   prepared to have her killed, too. Peter and Sarkar race to find a way
   to "pull the plug" on the sims before Philo and perhaps others die.
