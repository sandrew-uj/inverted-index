   The story alternates between the experiences of Conan and Lanna. A New
   Order ship discovers the island where Conan has been surviving for five
   years since the helicopter crash and captures him, taking him back to
   the city of Industria as a worker. Meanwhile, Lanna and her parents at
   High Harbor have to deal with Dyce, who wants her people to supply
   lumber faster than they can with the tools they have and is desperate
   for knowledge of the whereabouts of Briac Roa.

   The New Order seems to be resurrecting only the worst of the fallen
   civilization's qualities, putting together a military-industrial
   complex without a culture or conscience. Without telling him what it
   will mean, they mark his forehead with a tattoo that designates him as
   an "apprentice citizen," meaning that he will have to work to pay off
   the "debt" that he owes in gratitude for having "rescued" him. Enraged,
   he seizes the tattooing device and marks several self-important
   officials before he is subdued, and they assign him to work for a crazy
   old man named Patch, who turns out to be Teacher. Teacher has been
   hiding in Industria since the cataclysm, since it's the last place
   where the New Order would ever look for him, hiding his identity by
   acting like an insane, crippled old man.

   At High Harbor, Lanna and her parents are continuing to deal with Dyce
   and his demands--now he wants some wrecked aircraft that are on the
   island and some sassafras roots. Teacher has said that the New Order
   should by no means have those aircraft or the roots (the trees haven't
   yet multiplied to populations where there are enough to trade). Lanna
   finds out that they also have to deal with Orlo, who has been leading a
   rebellious tribe of children and teenagers that has broken away from
   the rest of High Harbor.

   Teacher, in the guise of Patch, is still an apprentice citizen despite
   having been in Industria for years, because he likes where he is: in a
   boat shop, building boats. No one else in Industria knows how to build
   them--the city wasn't even on the coast before the Change. But Teacher
   has been planning to leave, and now that Conan is here, Teacher can put
   those plans into motion.

   Sickness breaks out at High Harbor, and Dyce is the only one who has
   any medicines. Lanna discovers that not only is Orlo trying to take
   over High Harbor, he's making deals with Dyce. Teacher discovers that
   there's going to be another earthquake, and this one will drop half of
   what remains of Industria into the sea. His humanitarian nature forces
   him to go to the Council and tell them who he really is so he can warn
   them, but he wants Conan to take the boat he's been building and wait
   for him at a designated rendezvous point.

   Meanwhile, a child has died from the illness at High Harbor, and Shann
   and Mazal agree to let Dyce have the aircraft in exchange for the
   medicine they need, although Shann thinks Dyce deliberately started the
   sickness as a bargaining chip.

   Conan waits for Teacher, but Teacher doesn't come. Realizing that
   Teacher is in trouble, he returns to Industria and rescues him, and
   they set sail for High Harbor, hoping that the searchers from Industria
   don't find them. They run deliberately into a storm as the only way to
   escape pursuit, but Teacher nearly drowns. Conan manages to get them to
   the island where he had survived for five years, and with Teacher's
   help he modifies their ship for the voyage to High Harbor--but they
   will have to hurry, because they know that with the coming earthquake
   will also come a tsunami. To their surprise, they discover that Dr.
   Manski has also washed up on this island, because her survey ship was
   ordered to search for Briac Roa and went down in the same storm. They
   can't just leave her there with a tsunami on the way, and she has no
   choice but to go with them, but she still can't believe that he is
   Briac Roa or that such things as telepathy--or God--exist.

   Lanna despairs when Dyce entices more and more of the High Harbor
   people onto his trading vessel to show them the goods he has to
   trade--things that people don't need but that he can entice them into
   believing they want. She wishes she could see the ship for herself,
   because it might give her a better idea what to do, but she doesn't
   dare go there for fear of looking as if she were herself endorsing Dyce
   and his goods. So she tries something that has worked for her in the
   past; she sends her tern Tikki to fly over the ship and attempts to see
   through his eyes. But this fails. Instead, she climbs to the highest
   point on the island and tells Tikki to find Conan and bring him safely
   to High Harbor.

   Teacher tells Dr. Manski about how Dyce had traded for the flying
   machines and their power cells for medicine to stop the sickness that
   had killed one child at High Harbor, and how he may in fact have spread
   the sickness in the first place. Manski thinks he's lying, because she
   doesn't trust how he gets his information and because he's an enemy of
   the New Order. But she begins to believe that he really is Briac Roa.
   Tikki makes it to their ship, but the fog has closed in, and they can't
   follow him because they can't see what direction he flies in.

   Lanna and her parents learn that Orlo and Dyce have a plan to take over
   their house and move in, throwing Shann and Mazal out but keeping Lanna
   around, presumably as a plaything for Orlo. They resolve that this will
   not happen without a fight and arm themselves. Teacher has warned Mazal
   about the coming tsunami, and she has warned Dyce to take his ship out
   to sea, but he doesn't believe her. Lanna tries once more to put her
   psyche into Tikki and help him lead Conan and Teacher home, and this
   time she succeeds.

   Conan, Teacher and Dr. Manski arrive at High Harbor right in the middle
   of the strife. Orlo and Dyce's faction immediately moves to seize Conan
   and Teacher, but Conan fights back and tells them to take shelter
   because there's a tsunami coming. Neither Dyce nor Orlo believe either
   Conan or Dr. Manski. Orlo captures Lanna, but lets her go when Conan
   challenges him directly, and Conan easily defeats him, awing his
   followers. Conan then uses the situation to get them all to seek higher
   ground, carrying the semi-conscious Orlo himself as the tsunami waters
   start to rush in. The story ends rather abruptly as it appears they
   will all make it to safety by working together.
