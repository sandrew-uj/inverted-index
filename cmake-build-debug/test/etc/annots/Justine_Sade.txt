   The plot concerns Justine, a 12-year-old maiden ("As for Justine, aged
   as we have remarked, twelve") who sets off to make her way in France.
   It follows her until age 26 in her quest for virtue. She is presented
   with sexual lessons, hidden under a virtuous mask. The unfortunate
   situations include: the time when she seeks refuge and confession in a
   monastery, but is forced to become a sex slave to the monks, who
   subject her to countless orgies, rapes and similar rigours and the time
   when, helping a gentleman who is robbed in a field, he takes her back
   to his chateau with promises of a post caring for his wife, but she is
   then confined in a cave and subject to much the same punishment. These
   punishments are mostly the same throughout, even when she goes to a
   judge to beg for mercy in her case as an arsonist and then finds
   herself openly humiliated in court, unable to defend herself.

   These are described in true Sadean form. However, unlike some of his
   other works, the novel is not just a catalogue of sadism.

   Justine (Therese (or Sophie in the first version)) and Juliette were
   the daughters of Monsieur de Bertole. Bertole was a widower banker who
   fell in love with another man's lover. The man, Monsieur de Noirseuil,
   in the interest of revenge, pretended to be his friend, made sure he
   became bankrupt and eventually poisoned him, leaving the girls orphans.
   Juliette and Justine lived in a nunnery, where the abbess of the
   nunnery corrupted Juliette (and attempted to corrupt Justine too).
   However, Justine was sweet and virtuous. When the abbess found out
   about Bertole's death, she threw both girls out. Juliette's story is
   told in another book and Justine continues on in pursuit of virtue,
   beginning from becoming a maid in the house of the usurer Harpin, which
   is where her troubles begin anew.

   In her search for work and shelter Justine constantly fell into the
   hands of rogues who would ravish and torture her and the people she
   makes friends with. Justine was falsely accused of theft by Harpin and
   sent to jail expecting execution. She had to ally herself with a Miss
   Dubois, a criminal who helped her to escape along with her band. To
   escape, Miss Dubois arranged a fire to break out in the prison, in
   which 21 people died. After escaping the band of Dubois, Justine
   wanders off and accidentally trespasses upon the lands of the count of
   Bressac.

   The story is told by "Therese" ("Sophie" in the first version) in an
   inn, to Madame de Lorsagne. It is finally revealed that Madame de
   Lorsagne is her long-lost sister. The irony is that her sister
   submitted to a brief period of vice and found herself a comfortable
   existence where she could exercise good, while Justine refused to make
   concessions for the greater good and was plunged further into vice than
   those who would go willingly.

   The story ends with Madame de Lorsagne relieving her from a life of
   vice and clearing her name. Soon afterward, Justine becomes introverted
   and morose and is finally struck by a bolt of lightning and killed
   instantly. Madame de Lorsagne joins a religious order after Justine's
   death.
