   The novel describes a near utopia in which almost everything is
   automated by Computer One, with humanity's primary struggle being what
   to do with all its leisure time when there is very little work to be
   done.

   Though analogous to the Internet, the Computer One of the novel assumes
   a far greater unity of purpose and truth. Whereas the content of sites
   on the World Wide Web varies greatly and typically reflects the views
   of individual authors, Computer One provides a single authoritative
   source of information with no ambiguity.
