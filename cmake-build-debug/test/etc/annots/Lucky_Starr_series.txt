   Lucky Starr is the hero of a series of science fiction books by Isaac
   Asimov, using the pen name "Paul French" and intended for children.

   On 23 March 1951 Asimov met with his agent, Frederik Pohl, and Walter
   I. Bradbury, then the science fiction editor at Doubleday & Co., who
   had a proposal for him. Pohl and Bradbury wanted Asimov to write a
   juvenile science fiction novel that would serve as the basis for a
   television series. Fearing that the novel would be adapted into the
   "uniformly awful" programming he saw flooding the television
   channels,^[1] he decided to publish it under the pseudonym "Paul
   French".

   Asimov began work on the novel, David Starr: Space Ranger, on 10 June.
   He completed it on 29 July, and it was published by Doubleday in
   January 1952. Although plans for the television series fell through,
   Asimov continued to write novels in the series, eventually producing
   six. A seventh, Lucky Starr and the Snows of Pluto, was planned, but
   abandoned when Asimov elected to devote himself to writing non-fiction
   almost exclusively. With no worries about being associated with an
   embarrassing televised version, Asimov decided to abandon the pretense
   that he was not the author (although the books continued to be
   published under the Paul French pseudonym). He brought the Three Laws
   of Robotics into Lucky Starr and the Big Sun of Mercury, which he wrote
   in his autobiography "was a dead giveaway to Paul French's identity for
   even the most casual reader".^[2]

   Eventually, Asimov used his own name in later editions. Some cover
   pages bear his name only, while others credit "Isaac Asimov writing as
   Paul French".
