   The Fowl Adventures is a series of ten fantasy novels written by Irish
   author Eoin Colfer revolving around various members of the Fowl family.
   The first cycle, Artemis Fowl, follows elf LEP recon officer Holly
   Short as she faces the forces of criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II.
   The second cycle, The Fowl Twins, follow Fowl's younger twin brothers
   Myles and Beckett as they live out their house arrest under the
   supervision of pixie-elf hybrid Lazuli Heitz. The series has received
   positive critical reception and generated huge sales. It has also
   originated graphic novel adaptations.

   A film adaptation based on the first novel was in the process of
   development by Disney since 2016, which was eventually released on the
   Disney+ streaming service on 12 June 2020.
