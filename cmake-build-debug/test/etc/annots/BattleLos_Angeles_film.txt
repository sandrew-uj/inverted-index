   A number of apparent meteors land in the world's oceans, near 20 major
   coastal cities. The objects prove to be spacecraft containing hostile
   extraterrestrials. As Los Angeles (LA) is being evacuated, Marines from
   Camp Pendleton arrive, including Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz, an Iraq
   War veteran. Nantz, who was to begin his retirement, is assigned to 1st
   Platoon, Echo Company, of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines.

   Under the command of 2nd Lieutenant William Martinez, the platoon
   arrives at a forward operating base (FOB) established at Santa Monica
   Airport. The alien ground forces have no apparent air support, so the
   Air Force prepares to carpet bomb the Santa Monica area, and the
   platoon is given three hours to retrieve civilians from an LAPD station
   in West LA. As they advance through LA, they are ambushed and suffer
   multiple casualties. Nantz takes Marines Imlay and Harris to look for
   Lenihan, who is missing from the group. After fighting off an alien,
   they team up with some soldiers from the 40th Infantry Division and an
   Air Force intelligence Technical Sergeant, Elena Santos. At the police
   station, the makeshift platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian
   Michele, children Kirsten, Amy and Hector, and Hector's father Joe. A
   helicopter arrives to evacuate wounded Marines, but can not take on the
   weight of the civilians. During takeoff, it is destroyed by alien air
   units, killing Grayston, Guerrero, Lenihan and Simmons.

   The Marines commandeer an abandoned transit bus for the evacuation. En
   route, they deduce that the alien air units are drones that target
   human radio transmissions. Santos reveals that her mission is to locate
   the aliens' command and control center, as its destruction should
   deactivate the drones. When their bus comes under attack on an elevated
   freeway, the Marines rappel the group to street level. In the ensuing
   battle, Marines Stavrou and Mottola and the remainder of the Army
   National Guard soldiers are killed, while both Joe and Lieutenant
   Martinez are wounded fighting the aliens. Martinez uses his radio to
   attract the aliens, then detonates explosives, sacrificing himself.
   Nantz is now in command of surviving personnel Santos, Imlay, Kerns,
   Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and the civilians, continuing their escape from
   the bombing zone. A news report interviews a scientist who speculates
   that the aliens are seeking Earth's water for fuel while eradicating
   the human population.

   The carpet bombing never happens. Reaching the FOB, the Marines find it
   destroyed and that the military is retreating from LA. The Marines plan
   to escort the civilians to an alternate extraction point. When Joe dies
   from his wounds, Nantz comforts Hector. Lockett confronts Nantz
   regarding his brother, a Marine who, with four others, was killed
   during Nantz's last tour. They come to peace when Nantz explains that
   he continues to think of them, and recites each person's name, rank and
   serial number. Nantz motivates the group to move forward to honor their
   fallen comrades, including Joe for his bravery. They reach the
   extraction point and evacuate by helicopter.

   In flight, the chopper experiences a brief loss of power. Nantz
   theorizes that they are flying near the alien command center,
   transmitting intense radio messages to its drones. He orders his unit
   to accompany the civilians while he stays to reconnoiter the area, but
   his fighters all join him. Searching through sewers, they confirm the
   presence of a large alien vessel. Kerns radios in to request missiles,
   which Nantz manually directs using a laser designator while the others
   defend his position. Kerns is killed when a drone homes in on his
   radio, but the Marines succeed in routing a missile to the command
   module, which is destroyed. The uncontrolled drones fall from the sky,
   and the alien ground forces retreat.

   The remaining fighters--Nantz, Imlay, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and
   Santos--are evacuated to a base in the Mojave Desert, where they are
   greeted as heroes. They are told that their successful method has been
   transmitted to the armies battling alien forces in 19 other cities,
   that Michele and the three children were rescued, and that they can now
   rest. Instead, they re-arm and join the armed force leaving to retake
   Los Angeles.
