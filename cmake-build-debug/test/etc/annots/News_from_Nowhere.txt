   News from Nowhere (1890) is a classic work combining utopian socialism
   and soft science fiction written by the artist, designer and socialist
   pioneer William Morris. It was first published in serial form in the
   Commonweal journal beginning on 11 January 1890. In the novel, the
   narrator, William Guest, falls asleep after returning from a meeting of
   the Socialist League and awakes to find himself in a future society
   based on common ownership and democratic control of the means of
   production. In this society there is no private property, no big
   cities, no authority, no monetary system, no divorce, no courts, no
   prisons, and no class systems. This agrarian society functions simply
   because the people find pleasure in nature, and therefore they find
   pleasure in their work.

   The novel explores a number of aspects of this society, including its
   organisation and the relationships which it engenders between people.
   Morris fuses Marxism and the romance tradition when he presents himself
   as an enchanted figure in a time and place different from Victorian
   England. As Morris, the romance character, quests for love and
   fellowship--and through them for a reborn self--he encounters romance
   archetypes in Marxist guises. Old Hammond is both the communist
   educator who teaches Morris the new world and the wise old man of
   romance. Dick and Clara are good comrades and the married lovers who
   aid Morris in his wanderings. The journey on the Thames is both a
   voyage through society transformed by revolution and a quest for
   happiness. The goal of the quest, met and found though only
   transiently, is Ellen, the symbol of the reborn age and the bride the
   alien cannot win. Ellen herself is a multidimensional figure: a working
   class woman emancipated under socialism, she is also a benign nature
   spirit as well as the soul in the form of a woman.^[1] The book offers
   Morris' answers to a number of frequent objections to socialism, and
   underlines his belief that socialism will entail not only the abolition
   of private property but also of the divisions between art, life, and
   work.

   In the novel, Morris tackles one of the most common criticisms of
   socialism; the supposed lack of incentive to work in a communist
   society. Morris' response is that all work should be creative and
   pleasurable. This differs from the majority of Socialist thinkers, who
   tend to assume that while work is a necessary evil, a well-planned
   equal society can reduce the amount of work needed to be done by each
   worker. News From Nowhere was written as a libertarian socialist
   response to an earlier book called Looking Backward, a book that
   epitomises a kind of state socialism that Morris abhorred. It was also
   meant to directly influence various currents of thought at the time
   regarding the tactics to bring about socialism.^[2]
