   Chrestomanci, sometimes branded The Worlds of Chrestomanci, is a
   heptalogy of children's fantasy books written by British author Diana
   Wynne Jones, published from 1977 to 2006. In the context of the
   parallel universe setting of the books, Chrestomanci also refers to the
   British government office that is responsible for supervising the use
   of magic and Chrestomanci Castle in southern England, which is both
   residence and headquarters.

   The word "Chrestomanci" may be derived from the Ancient Greek khrestos,
   meaning "useful" and manteia, which means "prophecy or divination".
   Jones gives the pronunciation "KREST-OH-MAN-SEE" herself^[2] and one of
   her characters writes the same instruction for using the word as a
   spell.^[3]
