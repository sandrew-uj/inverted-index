   The story starts in the final years of the rule of King Uther
   Pendragon. The first part, "The Sword in the Stone", chronicles
   Arthur's upbringing by his foster father Sir Ector, his rivalry and
   friendship with his foster brother Kay, and his initial training by
   Merlyn, a wizard who lives through time backwards. Merlyn, knowing the
   boy's destiny, teaches Arthur (known as "Wart") what it means to be a
   good king by turning him into various kinds of animals: fish, hawk,
   ant, goose, and badger. Each of the transformations is meant to teach
   Wart a lesson, which will prepare him for his future life.

   Merlyn instills in Arthur the concept that the only justifiable reason
   for war is to prevent another from going to war and that contemporary
   human governments and powerful people exemplify the worst aspects of
   the rule of Might.

   White revised the original Sword in the Stone heavily for the four-part
   book in 1958. He took out the wizards' duel between Merlyn and Madame
   Mim, the adventure with T. natrix the snake, and the episode with the
   giant Galapagas. The first of those was replaced with the adventure of
   the ants. In the Wart's adventure with Merlyn's owl, Archimedes, the
   boy Arthur becomes a wild goose instead of visiting the goddess Athena.
   In the adventure with Robin Hood in the original book, the outlaws take
   the boys to attack the Anthropophagi (cannibals) and the Wart kills a
   Sciopod. In the 1958 version, the boys lead an attack on Morgan le
   Fay's Castle Chariot and Kay kills a griffin. The revisions reflect
   White's preoccupation with political questions in The Once and Future
   King, and generally give the first part of the work a more adult
   flavour.

   In part two, The Queen of Air and Darkness, White sets the stage for
   Arthur's demise by introducing the Orkney clan and detailing Arthur's
   seduction by their mother, his half-sister Queen Morgause. While the
   young king suppresses initial rebellions, Merlyn leads him to envision
   a means of harnessing potentially destructive Might for the cause of
   Right: the chivalric order of the Round Table.

   The third part, The Ill-Made Knight, shifts focus from King Arthur to
   the story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere's forbidden love, the
   means they adopt to hide their affair from the King (although he
   already knows of it from Merlyn), and its effect on Elaine, Lancelot's
   sometime lover and the mother of his son Galahad.

   The Candle in the Wind unites these narrative threads by telling how
   Mordred's hatred of his father and Sir Agravaine's hatred of Lancelot
   cause the eventual downfall of Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and the
   entire ideal kingdom of Camelot.

   The book begins as a quite light-hearted account of the young Arthur's
   adventures and King Pellinore's interminable search for the Questing
   Beast. Parts of The Sword in the Stone read almost as a parody of
   Arthurian legend by virtue of White's prose style, which relies heavily
   on anachronisms. However, the tale gradually changes tone: The Ill-Made
   Knight becomes more meditative, and The Candle in the Wind finds Arthur
   brooding over death and his legacy.
