   Set in 1948, the story begins in the Watts area of Los Angeles, with
   Ezekiel "Easy" Rawlins, a Houstonian -- from that city's Fifth Ward --
   who lost his job at an aviation defense plant in Los Angeles and is
   unable to pay the mortgage on his LA home. Easy is sitting in a bar run
   by Joppy, a friend who is also from Houston, when a man named DeWitt
   Albright walks into the bar and offers him a job finding a young white
   woman named Daphne Monet, who is rumored to be hanging out in bars
   frequented mostly by African Americans, although white women are
   allowed inside.

   At the bar, Easy meets two old friends, Coretta and Dupree, among many
   other people that he knew from his former life in Houston. Coretta says
   that she knows Daphne, but gives an incorrect address to Easy. He goes
   home with them and has sex with Coretta, while Dupree is asleep in the
   next room. Easy then leaves her early the next morning, only to be
   arrested by the LAPD. Shortly thereafter, following police
   interrogation, Easy is told that Coretta is dead, and that he is a
   suspect in her murder.

   When Easy finally does find Monet, he figures out that she has stolen a
   large amount of money from a man named Todd Carter, who is a local
   wealthy businessman. Albright wanted this money for himself.
   Eventually, Albright finds Monet through Easy, who is trying to shield
   the thieving woman.

   Easy enlists the help of a friend and fellow Houstonian, Mouse, who
   shows up due to a half-hearted invitation from Easy, and domestic
   strife back home. Easy and Mouse find Monet with Albright and Joppy.
   They rescue her, and kill Joppy and Albright. Then Mouse reveals that
   Monet is actually Ruby, an African-American woman passing as white, and
   the sister of a local gangster named Green. Mouse and Easy blackmail
   Ruby, taking her money and dividing it into thirds for each of them.
   Daphne/Ruby leaves shortly thereafter, and Easy has to clean up the
   mess with the police, as well as Carter, who had initially hired
   Albright to find her, since he really did love her and not his money.

   Easy approaches Carter and requests his help with the police. He
   blackmails him by saying that he will leak the information about his
   love for a black woman unless he is protected from the law. Carter
   helps him. At the conclusion, Mouse returns to Houston, Easy takes up
   detective work, and Ruby disappears.
