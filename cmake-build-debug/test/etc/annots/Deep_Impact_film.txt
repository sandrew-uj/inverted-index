   In May 1998, at a star party, teenage amateur astronomer Leo Beiderman
   observes an unidentifiable object in the night sky. He sends a picture
   to astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes it is a comet on collision
   course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car crash while racing to raise the
   alarm.

   A year later, journalist Jenny Lerner investigates Secretary of the
   Treasury Alan Rittenhouse over his connection with "Ellie", whom she
   supposes to be a mistress. She is apprehended by the FBI and taken to
   meet President Tom Beck, who persuades her not to share the story for
   48 hours in return for a prominent role in the press conference he will
   arrange. She subsequently discovers that "Ellie" is actually an acronym
   -- ELE -- which stands for "extinction-level event". Two days later,
   Beck announces that the comet Wolf-Beiderman is on course to impact the
   Earth in roughly one year and could cause humanity's extinction. He
   reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing the
   Messiah in orbit, a spacecraft to transport a team to alter the comet's
   path with nuclear bombs.

   The Messiah launches a short time later with a crew of five American
   astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut. They land on the comet's surface
   and drill the nuclear bombs deep beneath its surface.

   Rigging the bombs takes longer than anticipated and the crew are still
   on the surface when the comet's rotation moves them into the sunlight.
   One astronaut is blinded and another propelled into space by an
   explosive release of gas. The remaining crew of six escape the comet
   and detonate the bombs.

   Rather than destroy the comet, the bombs split it in two. Beck
   announces the mission's failure in a television address, and that both
   pieces -- the larger now named Wolf and the smaller named Beiderman --
   are both still headed for Earth. Martial law is imposed and a lottery
   selects 800,000 Americans to join 200,000 pre-selected individuals in
   underground shelters. Lerner is pre-selected as a trusted national
   journalist, as are the Beiderman family as gratitude for discovering
   the comet. Leo's girlfriend Sarah and her family are not, so Leo
   marries Sarah in a vain attempt to save her family, and Sarah refuses
   to go to the shelter without them.

   A last-ditch effort to deflect the comets with ICBMs fails. Upon
   arrival at the shelter, Leo eschews his safety and leaves to find
   Sarah. He reaches her on the freeway and takes her and her baby brother
   to high ground. Lerner gives up her seat on the evacuation helicopter
   to her friend Beth and her young daughter, and instead travels to the
   beach where she reconciles with her estranged father.

   The smaller comet, Beiderman, hits the Atlantic ocean, creating a
   megatsunami that destroys much of the East Coast of the United States
   and also hits Europe and Africa, resulting in millions of fatalities.
   Leo, Sarah, and her baby brother survive in the Appalachian Mountains.

   The crew of Messiah decide to sacrifice themselves to destroy the
   larger comet by flying deep inside it and detonating their remaining
   nuclear bombs. They say goodbye to their loved ones and execute their
   plan. Wolf is blown into smaller pieces which burn up harmlessly in the
   Earth's atmosphere.

   After the waters from the megatsunami recede, President Beck speaks to
   a large crowd at the damaged United States Capitol, encouraging them to
   remember those lost as they begin to rebuild.
