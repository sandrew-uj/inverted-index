   The player's six cities are being attacked by an endless hail of
   ballistic missiles, some of which split like multiple independently
   targetable reentry vehicles. New weapons are introduced in later
   levels: smart bombs that can evade a less-than-perfectly targeted
   missile, and bomber planes and satellites that fly across the screen
   launching missiles of their own. As a regional commander of three
   anti-missile batteries, the player must defend six cities in their zone
   from being destroyed.
