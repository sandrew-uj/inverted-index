   The novel alternates between the adventures of "New York tour guide
   Larry Bloom" who works "a nine-to-five grind herding privileged
   tourists through the city" and chapters from a book manuscript he has
   written "about the light in his listless life, Starshine Hart, a
   29-year-old, job-jumping beauty who attracts the gaze and adoration of
   nearly every man in the Tri-state area."
