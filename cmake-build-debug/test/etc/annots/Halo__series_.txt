   In the distant past, a powerful race called the Forerunners fought an
   alien parasite known as the Flood. The Flood, which spread through
   infestation of sentient life, overran much of the Milky Way Galaxy.
   Exhausting all other strategies, the Forerunners conceived the Halo
   Array--ring-shaped megastructures and weapons of last resort that would
   destroy all sentient life in the galaxy to stop the Flood. Delaying as
   long as they could, the Forerunners activated the rings and
   disappeared.^[15]

   Nearly a hundred thousand years later in the 26th century,
   humanity--under the auspices of the United Nations Space Command, or
   UNSC--colonize many worlds thanks to the development of
   faster-than-light "slipspace" travel. Tensions between the government
   and colonies desiring independence sparks violent clashes. The UNSC
   sponsors the SPARTAN-II Project to create an elite group of enhanced
   supersoldiers, whose purpose is to suppress the rebellions
   covertly.^[16] In the year 2525, human worlds come under attack by a
   theocratic alliance of alien races known as the Covenant. The Covenant
   leadership declares humanity heretics and an affront to their gods--
   the Forerunners--and begin a genocidal holy war. The Covenant's
   superior technology and numbers prove decisive advantages; though
   effective, the Spartans are too few in number to turn the tide of
   battle in humanity's favor. After the Covenant invade Reach, the UNSC's
   last major stronghold besides Earth, Master Chief John-117 is one of
   the few remaining Spartans left.

   The rediscovery of the Halo rings sets the humans against the Covenant,
   who believe they are instruments of transcendence, not destruction.
   Master Chief and his artificial intelligence Cortana are instrumental
   in the destruction of a Halo ring to stop the Covenant and the threat
   of the Flood. The Covenant descends into civil war following the
   expulsion of the Sangheili species, with many grappling over the
   revelation that their religion is false. The disgraced former Covenant
   Sangheili commander known as the Arbiter, along with the rest of his
   race, help the humans destroy the Covenant and stop its leader, Truth,
   from activating the Halo Array via the Ark.^[17] The Human-Covenant War
   ends, though conflict continues to rage throughout the universe. The
   UNSC creates a new generation of Spartans, and tensions between the
   UNSC and colonists resume.
