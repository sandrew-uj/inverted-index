   The Great Hyperspace War was instigated when two Republic hyperspace
   explorers accidentally crash-landed on the Sith graveyard planet
   Korriban during the funeral procession of Marka Ragnos. His successor,
   Naga Sadow, provoked war with the Republic, and installed himself as
   the leader of the Sith Empire. He fought not only the Republic, but the
   forces of his chief rival, Ludo Kressh, and was forced to destroy his
   own fleet to cover his escape. Sadow landed on Yavin IV and constructed
   vast temples with the labor of his Massassi warriors.

   Six hundred years later, fallen Jedi Freedon Nadd arrived on Yavin IV,
   and learned Sith sorcery from the spirit of Naga Sadow. He took his
   knowledge and the treasures of Sadow to the planet Onderon, where he
   used his acquired gifts to install himself as king. His spirit
   continued to advise his descendants.

   Another Jedi, Ulic Qel-Droma, was sent to Onderon to mediate a
   conflict, where he met the spirit of Freedon Nadd, who told him he
   would become a Sith Lord. The prophecy came true when the Krath, a
   secret dark side society, attacked the Republic and injured Ulic with
   alchemically-treated shrapnel, and then injected him with dark side
   poisons that would ensure his fall.

   Exar Kun left his master, Vodo-Siosk Baas, because his master would not
   let him learn about the dark side. He went to Onderon, where he learned
   of Freedon Nadd's tomb. Nadd's spirit told him to go to Korriban, where
   Nadd tricked him into accepting the dark side. They went to Yavin IV,
   where Nadd gave him a choice: surrender to the dark side, or die. Kun
   chose life. After learning about the dark side from Nadd, Kun destroyed
   him with a dark side amulet.

   Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma met on Cinnagar, and their battle was
   interrupted by the spirit of Marka Ragnos, who declared Kun the Dark
   Lord of the Sith, and Qel-Droma his apprentice. Together, they waged
   war on the Republic, stealing Jedi students from Ossus and subverting
   them to the dark side. Qel-Droma defeated Lord Mandalore, earning the
   services of the Mandalorian warriors. Qel-Droma attacked Coruscant, but
   was captured. Kun led a rescue attempt, and killed his former master in
   the process. Soon thereafter, the Sith Lords caused the Cron Cluster to
   go supernova, destroying countless Jedi artifacts on nearby Ossus.

   Before Ossus was destroyed, Ulic's brother Cay tried to convince him to
   return to the light. Ulic cut him down in a lightsaber duel and,
   horrified by what he had done, surrendered himself to his former lover,
   Nomi Sunrider, when she forever cut off his connection to the Force.
   Broken, Ulic surrendered to the Republic, and led them to Yavin IV,
   where Exar Kun committed a ritual that sapped the life from every
   Massassi on the planet to separate his spirit from his body and bind it
   to his temple.

   The Cleansing of the Nine Houses are the events during the aftermath of
   the Great Sith War, when, after the repentance of Ulic Qel-Droma, and
   the death/ascension of Exar Kun, the Old Republic hunted down and
   bloodily purged the remnants of the Sith Brotherhood.

   The video game Knights of the Old Republic, takes place forty years
   after the end of the Sith War.
