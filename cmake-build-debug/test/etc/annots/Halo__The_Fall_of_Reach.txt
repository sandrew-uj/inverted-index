   The novel opens with the civilian Dr. Catherine Halsey and Lieutenant
   Jacob Keyes traveling to meet John, a six-year-old boy. Dr. Halsey
   reveals to Keyes that John is one of 150 children who possess rare
   genetic markers making them suitable for conscription into the
   SPARTAN-II program, a secret experiment with the aim of creating super
   soldiers for the UNSC to quell rebellions.^[9] Seventy-five of the
   children are kidnapped by operatives of the Office of Naval
   Intelligence and replaced by clones engineered to die of natural causes
   shortly thereafter. From this point on, the recruits are known only by
   their first name and a three-digit number. John-117 and the rest of the
   children are drilled and trained by Franklin Mendez; John demonstrates
   leadership of his fellow Spartans, leading to his promotion to squad
   leader. In 2525, the Spartans undergo a series of surgical enhancements
   which turn them into highly efficient super soldiers - but more than
   half of the original 75 conscripts are paralyzed or killed.^[10] The
   Spartans are also equipped with powerful MJOLNIR battle armor, designed
   to respond as quickly as the soldier's thoughts. John-117 is further
   promoted to Master Chief Petty Officer.^[11] The Spartans are highly
   successful, but they experience a priority shift after a collective of
   alien races known as the Covenant begin obliterating human colonies,
   declaring humanity's destruction as the will of their gods. Mendez
   leaves the group to train the next generation of Spartans as John and
   his comrades first face the Covenant.^[12]

   By 2552, the war against the Covenant is going poorly. The
   technological superiority of the Covenant means that space battles
   heavily favor the Covenant, and the UNSC can only win engagements by
   suffering tremendous losses. To prevent the discovery of Earth or other
   human colonies, Vice Admiral Cole creates the "Cole Protocol", which
   forbids direct slipspace jumps to Earth or any other population center,
   and mandates the destruction of a ship before it can be captured by the
   Covenant. Jacob Keyes, now commander of the destroyer Iroquois,
   discovers four Covenant ships arriving at the Sigma Octanus System, and
   single-handedly destroys three of them; his heroics earn Keyes the rank
   of captain. The Covenant proceed to overrun Sigma Octanus IV, searching
   for a mysterious ancient artifact. Despite a costly fight, the humans
   manage to repel the Covenant, and Keyes intercepts a coded Covenant
   transmission from the surface before the Covenant retreat.^[13] The
   Iroquois heads to Reach, unwittingly bringing a Covenant tracking
   device with it.^[14]

   Soon after, Keyes is given the command of the UNSC cruiser Pillar of
   Autumn for a secret mission: the Spartans are to capture one of the
   Covenant's religious leaders and barter a truce.^[15] Dr. Halsey also
   introduces John to the artificial intelligence Cortana, who would
   assist the Spartans by residing in their MJOLNIR armor.^[16] Before the
   mission can begin, however, Reach is attacked by a massive Covenant
   fleet. John and Cortana reach the Pillar of Autumn, but most of the
   other Spartans are presumed killed as the Covenant vitrify the surface
   of Reach, turning the landmasses into glass.^[17] Cortana initiates a
   slipspace course based on the ancient glyphs intercepted by the
   Covenant at Sigma Octanus; the course takes them to a massive ringworld
   known as Halo, setting the stage for the events of Halo: Combat
   Evolved.^[18]^[19]
