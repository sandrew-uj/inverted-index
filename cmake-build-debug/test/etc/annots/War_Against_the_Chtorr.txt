   Set in a devastated early 21st century United States with logical
   expected advances in current technology such as a fledgling moon base,
   this series of science-fiction novels describe the invasion of Earth by
   an alien ecology. The story is unusual in that the tactics used by the
   aliens eschew the usual direct attack in favor of terraforming the
   ecosystem.

   The United States has suffered serious political and social upheavals.
   These have come from unintended consequences of US government choices
   regarding geopolitical crises and interventionism. In the timeline of
   the books, there had been another US/Eastern Bloc proxy war -- between
   the State of Israel and certain other Middle Eastern nations -- in the
   recent past. This had been similar to a larger, higher-technology
   version of the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, the 1973 Arab-Israeli War,
   and others. The books do not explain the detailed conduct of the
   fictional new war, neither do they state which countries fought Israel.

   In the summer of 1997, Israel had deployed a nuclear weapon -- and the
   world's perception was that Israel had done so at the instructions of
   the United States. In a case rather like a reversal of the Cuban
   Missile Crisis, America had been placed under an explicit nuclear
   ultimatum from the Soviet Union. Modern printings of the books,
   however, state that the ultimatum came from Russia.

   The unnamed President of the United States had refused to accept that a
   nuclear World War III was inevitable, so he had decided to travel to
   Moscow, where in the year 2000 "the Millennium Treaties" had been
   signed. The United States had been substantially hobbled by the
   Millennium Treaties. Years later there had been subsequent treaties
   after the United States entered a bitter war in Pakistan. The US failed
   in its objectives there, and it was given another nuclear ultimatum.
   The second ultimatum came from the People's Republic of China. As a
   result, the United States was required to greatly weaken its armed
   forces, to comply with new bans on certain weapon systems, to make
   official statements of culpability for warmongering, and to undertake
   new programs of civic education for the young that were supposed to
   establish precautions against the possibility of Americans making
   choices to start future wars. Also, the United States was made to pay
   heavy reparations to the international community. America's network of
   allies continues to realign and break apart. Other countries continue
   to become more hostile, even though it is not always in a military
   sense of hostility.

   U.S. leaders respond by stimulating the domestic economy with large
   investments in new technologies. Secondly, the U.S. manages to
   surreptitiously re-structure the reparations required under the
   Millennium Treaties. The new US national security strategy is subtle,
   and has a focus on making other countries more reliant on the United
   States. This was done through applying economic diplomacy, sharp power,
   soft power, and other measures to increase foreign dependency on a
   variety of assets and systems controlled or heavily influenced by
   America. These include America's new generations of advanced robotic
   systems, American space-based solar power technologies, American food
   exports, American space transportation systems such as spaceplanes, and
   newly expanded efforts by agencies such as the Peace Corps and USAID.

   In great secrecy, the American government continues work on advanced
   military technologies, dual-use technologies, and finding means to
   leverage the revolution in military affairs to gain advantage in this
   radically new geopolitical situation. The books give attention to such
   things as high-energy microwave weapons, cyberwarfare, military
   teleoperation, and intelligent agents that can be militarized. All
   these efforts are forbidden under the Millennium Treaties.

   Soon afterwards, a lengthy onslaught of devastating plagues sweeps the
   world, killing 60% of humanity. As the survivors struggle to rebuild
   civilization, they gradually discover that hundreds of alien plant and
   animal species have mysteriously begun to entrench themselves. All
   these strange species are far more opportunistic and aggressive than
   the native organisms occupying the same ecological niches. As a result,
   Earth's entire ecology is being rapidly supplanted (or
   "chtorraformed"). The invaders are called Chtorrans after the sound
   made by the most deadly predator encountered so far.

   There are no signs of sentient aliens, but humans presume the invasion
   to be deliberate, either "seeded" from space or brought by undetected
   spacecraft. Many of the Chtorran organisms (see below) exhibit
   behaviors that are quasi-sentient (building structures, creating and
   using tools, farming/herding, setting traps, singing), yet the central
   question of whether they are doing so out of sentience or collective
   and programmed behavior is as yet unanswered. With each new layer of
   organisms, a bit more hierarchy to the Chtorran "societal" structure is
   revealed, allowing the possibility that all these organisms will
   transform the Earth in support of some worse, higher form of Chtorran
   life. The presumed goal of these off-stage aliens appears to be the
   complete replacement of Earth's ecology -- such that most macroscopic
   native organisms would be wiped out, a tiny percentage of native
   organisms would be altered or reconditioned to be placed under
   husbandry, and the aliens would presumably be able claim Earth without
   a single shot. Another possibility is that collectively the Chtorr are
   the aliens. The ecological invasion has gained enormous footholds, and
   humanity has yet to figure out who the true enemy is; let alone how to
   fight back successfully).

   The books largely follow the adventures of Jim McCarthy, a scientist
   and soldier in the U.S. Army, who attempts to understand the Chtorran
   ecology even as he engages in combat to destroy it. His early efforts
   primarily focus on the "Worms", a particularly large and dangerous apex
   predator Chtorran species whose prey consists largely of human beings.
   McCarthy and other scientists investigate the rapidly expanding webs of
   Chtorran ecosystems and attempt to unravel the relationships between
   the species.

   In addition to descriptions of alien ecology, the Chtorr series
   includes lengthy expositions on various aspects of human psychology,
   particularly under wartime and survival conditions.
