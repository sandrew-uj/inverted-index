   The novel opens outside a club called the Dancers. It is late October
   or early November. No year is given for the events but internal
   evidence and the publication date of the novel place them between 1950
   and 1952. Philip Marlowe meets a drunk named Terry Lennox, a man with
   scars on one side of his face. They forge an uneasy friendship over the
   next few months. In June, Lennox shows up late one night at Marlowe's
   home in "a great deal of trouble" and needing a ride to the airport
   across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. Marlowe agrees as long as Lennox
   does not tell him any details of why he is running.

   On his return to Los Angeles, Marlowe learns that Lennox's wife was
   found dead in her guest house and that she died before Lennox fled.
   Marlowe is arrested on suspicion of murder after refusing to co-operate
   with investigators, who want him to confess that he helped Lennox flee.
   After three days of antagonizing his interrogators, Marlowe is
   released, the police explaining that Lennox has been reported to have
   committed suicide in Otatoclan with a written confession by his side.
   Marlowe gets home to find a cryptic note from Lennox containing a
   "portrait of Madison" (a $5,000 bill).
   A "portrait of Madison"

   Marlowe gets a call from Howard Spencer, a New York publisher, who asks
   him to investigate a case. One of Spencer's best writers, Roger Wade,
   has a drinking problem and has been missing for three days. Initially
   Marlowe refuses but after Wade's wife, Eileen, also asks for Marlowe's
   help, he consents. Marlowe finds Wade in a makeshift detox facility in
   an isolated and soon to be abandoned ranch. He takes his fee but the
   Wades' stories do not match.

   The Wades each try to convince Marlowe to stay at their house to keep
   Roger writing instead of drinking and though he refuses, he ends up
   making further trips to the house at their behest. On one such trip, he
   finds Wade passed out in the grass with a cut on his head and Mrs. Wade
   oddly disinterested in her husband's welfare. Once Roger comes to, he
   begs Marlowe to remove and destroy typewritten pages in his study he
   wrote while drunk, not wanting his wife to read them. Marlowe does so
   but reads the pages, finding a cryptic self-analysis by Wade which
   hints at repressed trauma he doesn't quite understand, alongside a
   clear statement that once "a good man died" for him.

   Another time, after being called by a drunk and disoriented Roger,
   Marlowe arrives to find the couple struggling over a gun in Roger's
   bedroom, which goes off as Marlowe is trying to separate them. The shot
   goes harmlessly into the ceiling. Marlowe sits with Roger until the
   latter has taken a couple of sleeping pills. As he's leaving, a
   distraught Eileen enters a sort of trance and attempts to seduce
   Marlowe, thinking him to be a former lover of hers who died ten years
   earlier in the Second World War. Marlowe refuses with difficulty and
   crashes on the couch downstairs, getting completely drunk so he passes
   out instead of being tempted to go back to Eileen's room. The next
   morning Eileen behaves normally and Marlowe leaves.

   Marlowe is repeatedly threatened to cease his continued investigation
   of the Lennox case, first by a friend of Lennox's named Mendy Menendez,
   who is a Las Vegas gangster, then by Lennox's wealthy father-in-law,
   his old friend Bernie Ohls from the LAPD, the Wades' servant (a Chilean
   named Candy) and Mrs. Wade. Through his own hunches and inquiries,
   Marlowe also learns that Terry Lennox had previously lived as Paul
   Marston, who had married and lived for a time in England.

   Roger calls Marlowe again, asking him to come by to have lunch with
   him. After indulging in self-pity over his writing difficulties, he
   posits that he's an alcoholic because he's trying to find answers to
   the trauma in his past, then proceeds to drink himself into a stupor.
   Marlowe asks him if he ever knew someone named Paul Marston, and with
   an effort Roger says no. Marlowe takes a walk outside. When he returns,
   Eileen is ringing the doorbell, having forgotten her key. Marlowe finds
   Roger dead on the couch, apparently from suicide, but Eileen accuses
   Marlowe of killing her husband. Candy fabricates a story to implicate
   Marlowe, believing him to be guilty but his claims are undermined in an
   interrogation.

   Marlowe receives a call from Spencer regarding Wade's death and bullies
   Spencer into taking him to see Mrs. Wade. Once there, Marlowe grills
   her on the death of Terry Lennox's wife. Eileen first tries to blame it
   all on Roger but Marlowe pokes holes in her story and argues that she
   killed both Mrs. Lennox and Roger Wade, and that Lennox was her first
   husband, presumed killed in action with the British Special Air Service
   during the war. Eileen Wade leaves with no response. The next morning,
   Marlowe learns that she has killed herself, overdosing on sleeping
   pills, leaving a note describing the affair Mrs. Lennox was having with
   her husband and confessing to killing them both.

   Marlowe refuses to let the story lie, and when the authorities decide
   to forgo an inquest because it will show them up, he steals a photostat
   of Eileen's confession from the police. Marlowe contacts a reporter he
   knows in order to make sure the confession is printed, even though the
   reporter warns him that he'll make numerous enemies by doing so.
   Marlowe replies that he has been trying to say goodbye to Terry Lennox
   for "a long, long time." A few days later, Marlowe is assaulted by
   Menendez, who is then arrested by Ohls in a setup arranged by a police
   commissioner who served with Menendez and Lennox during the war. Ohls
   explains that Marlowe was intentionally left in a position to steal a
   photostat, because the police commissioner wanted to trap Menendez in a
   felony, and Ohls knew Marlowe's scruples and stubbornness would lead
   him to do the best he could to clear Lennox's name.

   After Marlowe contacts this commissioner and hints that he knows the
   full story has still not been told, he is visited by a Mexican man who
   claims to have been present when Lennox was killed in his hotel room.
   Marlowe listens to his story but rejects it and offers his own version,
   ending with the revelation the Mexican man is none other than Lennox,
   who has had cosmetic surgery. Lennox attempts to make amends for the
   trouble he has caused Marlowe but is rebuffed, with Marlowe claiming
   that while he doesn't judge him for what he did, he returns the $5,000
   bill and says Lennox is "not here anymore." Lennox is hurt by this and
   leaves after saying goodbye. The novel ends with Marlowe listening to
   Lennox leave and faintly hoping he might return but instead explaining
   that he never saw him again.
