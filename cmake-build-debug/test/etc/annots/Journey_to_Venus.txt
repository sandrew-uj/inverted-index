   Journey to Venus the Primeval World; Its Wonderful Creations and
   Gigantic Monsters is an 1895 science fiction novel written by Gustavus
   W. Pope.^[1] The book was a sequel to Pope's novel of the previous
   year, Journey to Mars. The Venus volume features the same hero and
   heroine, Lt. Frederick Hamilton, USN, and his love interest the Martian
   princess Suhlamia. They travel to Venus on a Martian "ethervolt"
   spacecraft.^[2]^[3]

   The publisher promoted the book as "full of exciting adventures,
   hairbreadth escapes, and perilous vicissitudes, among primeval monsters
   and semi-human creatures, the episodes following each other in such
   breathless succession that the interest of the reader never flags."^[4]

   Modern critics have noted the book largely for its depiction of giant
   dinosaur-like Venusian beasts. Pope's pair of novels on Mars and Venus
   (volumes in a projected Romances of the Planets series that the author
   never continued) were precursors of popular planetary adventure novels
   of the twentieth century by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Otis Adelbert Kline,
   and other writers.

   The original edition of Journey to Venus from Arena Publishing Co.
   featured sixteen illustrations by "Miss Fairfax and Mrs. McAuley." The
   ensuing "paper-covered" edition reduced the illustrations to three.
   After the 1896 bankruptcy of Arena Publishing, Journey to Venus was
   reprinted in 1897 by the New York firm F. T. Neely, with the reduced
   number of three illustrations.
