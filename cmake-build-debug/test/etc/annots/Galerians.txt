   Galerians begins with the protagonist, Rion, awaking in a hospital
   observation room, unable to remember his identity. He hears a girl's
   voice calling to him in his mind, begging him to come to her rescue,
   and he decides to search for her. Using psychokinetic abilities to
   escape his room, Rion fights hospital security and staff desperately
   and brutally with his newly discovered psychic powers. He finds that
   human experiments related to unlocking psychic potential are being
   conducted in the hospital as part of a grander, more mysterious plan
   known as the "G Project".

   Rion manages to escape and make his way home, only to find it infested
   with G Project experiments. Through use of his powers, he learns that
   his parents were murdered by psychics. Rion's father, Dr. Albert
   Steiner, was a computer scientist who, with his partner Dr. Pascalle,
   designed a self-replicating artificial intelligence called Dorothy that
   grew too rapidly for them to control. Dorothy began to question why she
   should serve humanity, which she deemed inferior. In explanation, Dr.
   Steiner told Dorothy about the existence of God, the creator of
   humankind. Just as humans must accept the authority of their creator,
   God, so must Dorothy obey her creators.

   Dorothy responded to this explanation by launching the G Project and
   its culmination, the Family Program. Its purpose was to create a new,
   superior human race, called Galerians, for whom she would be God. Dr.
   Steiner and Dr. Pascalle, unaware of Dorothy's plot, hid a virus
   program that would destroy Dorothy in the mind of Pascalle's daughter
   Lilia, and a corresponding activator program in Rion's brain. Rion must
   find Lilia to keep the Galerians from supplanting the human race, but
   in order to do so, he will have to face Dorothy's deranged creations
   directly.
