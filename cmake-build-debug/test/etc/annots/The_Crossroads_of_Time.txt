   In the fall of 1955, in New York City, as the snow begins to fall,
   Blake Walker has come from Ohio to attend college. Goaded by one of the
   forebodings that have punctuated his life, he rescues a man from a
   kidnapper and then discovers that the kidnapper's friends have taken an
   unhealthy interest in him. The man he rescued, Mark Kittson, arranges
   for him to disappear into an organization that occupies a hidden
   apartment. There he meets the other members of Kittson's team, Jason
   Saxton, Stan Erskine, and Hoyt.

   The next day, alone in the apartment, Blake hears someone trying to
   break in. At the same time he is subjected to a telepathic assault that
   knocks him out. When he regains consciousness he tells Kittson and the
   others what happened. Kittson explains to him that he and the others
   are agents from an alternate Earth, one more advanced technologically
   and psychically than is Blake's Earth. They are hunting a criminal,
   Kmoat Vo Pranj, who may have been the burglar Blake semi-encountered.
   Discerning that their hideout has been discovered and may be subject to
   a police raid, the men move their operation to a house on Patroon Place
   in the Mount Union section of the city, picking up a stray kitten that
   Hoyt begins to train telepathically.

   As he returns to the house from a local drug store, Blake is kidnapped
   by gangsters working for Pranj and taken to Pranj's hideout. There he
   is thrown into a dark cellar with a timid petty crook named Lefty
   Conners. Searching the cellar for a way out, the two men come upon a
   square platform that has a rod like a crowbar jutting up from it. Lefty
   tries to pull the rod loose and activates a mechanism that takes the
   platform and both men into a laboratory on an alternate Earth.

   As he explores the building above the laboratory Blake becomes trapped.
   He manages to escape and discovers that Lefty is really Pranj. He
   returns to the weird vehicle in the laboratory and activates it just as
   one of the world's natives shoots him in the left shoulder with a heat
   ray. The carrier then takes Blake to a world in which Manhattan is a
   bleak landscape dotted with stone towers and patrolled by carnivorous
   hag-like creatures accompanied by giant robot centipedes.

   Escaping from that world and trying to get back to his own world, Blake
   comes to a similar one, a world in which New York has been bombed into
   ruins. As he confronts one of the natives, the carrier activates itself
   and vanishes. The native takes him to Sarge, a benign dictator whose
   group has colonized Central Park and hopes to restore some measure of
   civilization on Manhattan after they have cleared out the "hiders", the
   criminal element that preys upon them. Sarge tells Blake about a
   shadowy character called Ares, who appears to be organizing the hiders,
   and Blake assumes that it is Pranj, using his teledynamic abilities to
   control the lesser men.

   Believing that Kittson and his team will eventually come to this world,
   Blake leads a team to the Patroon Place house, pointing out the drug
   store on the way so that some of the men can scavenge its contents. At
   the house the men find evidence of a recent visit and they leave Blake
   and one young man to wait. Warned by his sense of foreboding, Blake
   pushes the young man into the garage just as the booby-trapped house
   explodes. Blake takes the injured man to the drug store to hole up for
   the night and wait for the rest of Sarge's men to return.

   The next day Kittson and his team show up. They hope to capture Pranj
   at a mass meeting of the hiders, where Pranj intends to hand out
   advanced weapons. Sarge's men show up as well and a battle rages. Blake
   and the others thwart Pranj's plan, leaving the battle to be won by
   Sarge. They return to Blake's original timeline to find Hoyt and Pranj
   locked in a teledynamic duel, a true battle of wills. With
   reinforcement Hoyt wins the battle and the men capture Pranj. Because
   Blake knows too much he is obliged to accompany the men to their home
   timeline.
