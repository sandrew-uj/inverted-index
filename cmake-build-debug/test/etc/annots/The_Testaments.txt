   The novel alternates between the perspectives of three women, presented
   as portions of a manuscript written by one (the Ardua Hall Holograph)
   and testimonies by the other two.

   Lydia, a divorced judge, is imprisoned with other women in a stadium
   during the establishment of Gilead. After enduring weeks of squalid
   conditions and solitary confinement, she and a small group of other
   women are handpicked by Commander Judd and Vidala, a pre-existing
   supporter of Gilead, to become Aunts--an elite group of women tasked
   with creating and overseeing the laws and uniforms governing Gilead's
   women. The Aunts use Ardua Hall as their headquarters and enjoy certain
   privileges that include reading "forbidden" texts, such as Cardinal
   John Henry Newman's Apologia Pro Vita Sua. In secret, Aunt Lydia
   despises Gilead and becomes a mole supplying critical information to
   the Mayday resistance organization.

   Fifteen years after the events of The Handmaid's Tale, a girl named
   Agnes Jemima is growing up in Boston as the adopted daughter of
   Commander Kyle and his wife Tabitha. Agnes has a loving relationship
   with Tabitha, who later dies of ill health. Agnes and her classmates
   Becka and Shunammite attend an elite preparatory school for the
   daughters of Commanders, where they are taught to run a household, but
   not to become literate. Once widowed, Commander Kyle marries Paula, the
   widow of a deceased Commander, who despises Agnes. She acquires a
   Handmaid to conceive a child for herself, resulting in the birth of a
   son, Mark, and the death of Ofkyle (whose real name was Crystal) during
   childbirth. Agnes is arranged to be married to Commander Judd, now a
   high-ranking official in charge of the Eyes and surveilling the
   population of Gilead.

   Agnes later learns that she is the daughter of a Handmaid. She manages
   to escape her arranged marriage by becoming a Supplicant, a prospective
   Aunt. In that pursuit she joins Becka, whose father--Doctor Grove, a
   prominent dentist--has been sexually abusing her and his other underage
   female patients for years. Later, Agnes is anonymously provided with
   files highlighting the corruption and hypocrisy at the heart of Gilead,
   specifically evidence of adultery between Commander Kyle and Paula and
   their respective uxoricide and mariticide of their spouses (divorce
   having been prohibited in Gilead). She also learns that she is the
   half-sister of "Baby Nicole," a girl who was smuggled out of Gilead to
   Canada by her Handmaid mother when she was young (and whose return the
   government of Gilead has been demanding).

   Meanwhile, a girl named Daisy--several years younger than Agnes--grows
   up in Toronto's Queen Street West with her adoptive parents, Neil and
   Melanie. The couple owns a second-hand clothes shop serving as a front
   for Mayday to smuggle women out of Gilead. On her 16th birthday,
   Daisy's adoptive parents are murdered by undercover Gilead operatives.
   Daisy is spirited into hiding by several Mayday operatives, who reveal
   that Daisy is actually Nicole. The Mayday operatives enlist her in a
   mission to infiltrate Gilead in order to obtain valuable intelligence
   from their mysterious mole. Nicole poses as a street urchin Jade in
   order to be recruited by the Pearl Girls (Gilead missionaries who lure
   foreign women to Gilead with the promise of a better life), who take
   her up and bring her into Gilead.

   The disguised Nicole is placed under the care of Agnes and Becka, who
   are now respectively named Aunts Victoria and Immortelle. Aunt Lydia
   confirms that "Jade" is Nicole through a tattoo and discloses her true
   identity and parentage to Agnes and Becka. Revealing herself as
   Mayday's mole, Aunt Lydia enlists the three young women to smuggle
   incriminating information about Gilead's elite into Canada. Nicole is
   tasked with carrying the files inside a microdot on her cruciform
   tattoo. Agnes and Nicole are to enter Canada disguised as Pearl Girls,
   with Nicole impersonating Becka. The real Becka, disguised as Jade, is
   to remain at the Hall and provide a diversion once Nicole was found
   missing. Forced to hasten their plans when Commander Judd learns about
   Nicole's presence and intends to marry her, Agnes and Nicole set out
   early, where they hospitalise Aunt Vidala in the process. They travel
   by bus and on foot, then by boat along the Penobscot River. This boat
   takes them to a larger vessel which brings them into Canadian waters.
   Agnes and Nicole manage to reach Campobello Island by an inflatable and
   are picked up by a Mayday team. Meanwhile, Aunt Lydia, in order to buy
   Agnes and Nicole some more time and to secure her own position at Ardua
   Hall, tells Aunt Elizabeth that Aunt Vidala accused her of attacking
   her, expecting Elizabeth to kill Vidala.

   Using the information inside Nicole's microdot, the Canadian media
   leaks scandalous information about Gilead's elite, which leads to a
   purge that in turn causes a military coup, bringing about the collapse
   of Gilead and the subsequent restoration of the United States. Agnes
   and Nicole are reunited with their mother. Becka dies while hiding in a
   cistern to perpetuate the ruse that "Jade" had run off with a plumber.
   Lydia, the author of the Ardua Hall Holograph, closes her story by
   describing her plan to commit suicide with a morphine overdose before
   she can be questioned and executed.

   The novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue, described as a
   partial transcript at the Thirteenth Symposium on Gileadean Studies in
   2197, presented by Professor James Darcy Pieixoto. He talks about the
   challenges in verifying the authenticity of the Ardua Hall Holograph
   and the two witness transcripts by Agnes and Nicole. He also speculates
   that Agnes and Nicole's Handmaid mother could be Offred of the previous
   book, though he himself admits to not being sure. He concludes by
   mentioning the statue that was made commemorating Becka for her
   actions, its dedication having been attended by Agnes and Nicole, their
   husbands and children, their mother and their respective fathers.
