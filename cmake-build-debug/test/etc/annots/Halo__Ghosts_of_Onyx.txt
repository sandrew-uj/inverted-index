   The story begins with a group of SPARTAN-IIIs being deployed to a
   Covenant fleet refueling depot in the year 2545. The soldiers destroy
   the facility, but all save two of the three hundred SPARTANs are
   killed. The narrative then moves back to 2531, where SPARTAN-IIs are
   deployed against human insurrectionists; though the team is almost
   captured, the timely intervention of Kurt-051 allows the team to
   complete their mission. Meanwhile, Colonel James Ackerson meets with
   the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Ackerson announces his plan to
   create a new breed of SPARTANs which retains much of the supersoldiers'
   effectiveness, without the high price tag of the SPARTAN-II program.
   These SPARTAN-IIIs are trained by Franklin Mendez, as well as Kurt-051.
   With his death staged by ONI, Kurt-051 is placed in full charge of
   SPARTAN-III training, under the name and rank of Lieutenant Kurt
   Ambrose. The SPARTAN-III project is carried out on a secret ONI planet
   named Onyx, where there is also an archaeological excavation of ancient
   Forerunner ruins in an area known as "Zone 67". When a company of
   SPARTAN-IIIs goes missing in Zone 67, it is declared off-limits to all
   personnel.

   Like the SPARTAN-IIs, the SPARTAN-III candidates undergo radical
   cybernetic and biological enhancements and are outfitted with special
   armor to increase their abilities. The first SPARTAN-III company proves
   highly successful, but is wiped out when ordered to destroy a Covenant
   orbital shipyard in 2537. Shaken by the massacre of his troops, Kurt
   improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III
   recruits, but they too are all killed in action so Kurt, in an effort
   to reduce casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on
   the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise
   near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien
   robotic drones.

   Meanwhile, Dr. Catherine Halsey, the SPARTAN-II project's creator,
   along with the SPARTAN Kelly-087 arrive in the Onyx system. As they
   near the surface of the planet they are attacked by more robot drones
   and crash, meeting up with the human survivors of the attacks. Halsey
   identifies the robotic drones as Forerunner Sentinels from the
   artificial intelligence Cortana's logs of the events of Halo: Combat
   Evolved. Halsey sends a message back to Earth, which is under attack by
   Covenant; in response, Lord Hood sends the SPARTAN-IIs Fred-104,
   Linda-058, and Will-043 to Onyx.

   At the Forerunner ringworld Delta Halo, the Covenant are in the midst
   of a civil war. Elites intercept Halsey's distress signal and learn of
   the existence of Onyx and its Forerunner technology. Both the Covenant
   and the UNSC forces which arrive at Onyx are attacked by Sentinels. The
   entire UNSC fleet at Onyx is destroyed by the ensuing battle, save for
   one stealth ship, the Dusk, which stays hidden, observing the events.

   The remaining human forces on Onyx discover a Forerunner city being
   rapidly uncovered by the Sentinels, and are guided into a massive
   sphere by Dr. Halsey. She determines that the entire planet is actually
   a "Shield World" constructed by the Forerunners to protect themselves
   from the firing of the Halo ringworlds, which are designed to eradicate
   all sentient life. Fighting off Covenant pursuers, the humans discover
   an entrance leading to a Dyson Sphere. Kurt remains behind in order to
   detonate two nuclear weapons to stop the Covenant from following the
   humans into the Sphere. Hiding at a distance from Onyx, the Dusk
   watches as Onyx's surface rips apart to reveal that the entire world is
   constructed of Sentinels, all connected together to provide an
   impenetrable defense around the Dyson Sphere at the heart of the
   planet. The Sentinels annihilate the remaining Covenant fleet vessels
   orbiting the planet and the Prowler retreats. Fred, now inside the
   Dyson Sphere, takes command of the survivors and orders everyone to
   search for method of escape.
