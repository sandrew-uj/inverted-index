   Seeking vengeance on his enemy, evil magician Mardanax of Zaar,
   infiltrates Patanga, capital city of Thongor's growing Lemurian empire.
   He succeeds in striking Thongor down and drugging his wife Queen Sumia
   into pliability. Under Mardanax's sway she agrees to wed the nobleman
   the Zaarian has marked out to be his puppet ruler.

   The young officer Charn Thovis, fearing for the safety of Thongor and
   Sumia's young son Thar, spirits the prince away, but a giant flying
   lizard forces their airboat down and the two fall into the hands of
   Barim Redbeard's pirates from the rogue city-state of Tarakus.
   Concealing their identities, the two at first are able to join the
   crew, but Thar is soon found out and taken hostage by the pirate king
   Kashtar.

   Meanwhile, Thongor's spirit-form passes through a gloomy netherworld,
   receiving messages regarding his destiny, culminating in a personal
   encounter with Father Gorm, chief of the Nineteen Gods, who tells him
   how he has been marked for greatness and must return to the world of
   the living to complete his work. He is granted visions of a future
   extending from his own impending conquest of the whole continent
   through several cataclysms in which the civilization of Lemuria is
   succeeded by that of Atlantis, and ultimately, "at the end of time,"
   early Egypt. The culmination of his historical vision is thus the
   beginning of our own recorded history. The author implies that Robert
   E. Howard's "Hyborian Age" and its premier hero Conan the Barbarian
   fits into this grand panorama.

   In Tarakus, Charn and Thar's shipmates help them escape and return to
   Patanga to prevent Sumia's forced wedding. Their airboat crashes the
   ceremony, and the machinations of Mardanax are exposed as Thongor leaps
   from his coffin and dispatches him.

   The book includes a frontispiece map by the author of "Patanga, City of
   the Flame" and a semifictional appendix on "The Source of the Lemurian
   Mythos" in which he claims to have derived the overall storyline of the
   Thongor books from a translation of the rare Indian scriptures known as
   the Upa-Puranas in combination with some of Helena Blavatsky's
   Theosophic notions of prehistorical races. The Upa-Puranas do not in
   fact exist.
