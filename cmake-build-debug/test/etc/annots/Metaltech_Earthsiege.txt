   On November 29, 2471, the race for true artificial intelligence ended
   when Sentinel Cybertronix activated Project: Prometheus. Prometheus was
   a prototype, the first cybernetic-hybrid machine, or Cybrid. The mass
   production of these Cybrids and their use for war, to the point of
   nuclear war devastated Earth's population. In the aftermath, the
   Cybrids turned against their human creators, forcing the humans into
   hiding. Twenty years later, the humans started their own resistance.
   Using hit-and-run tactics against the machines, the humans managed to
   survive and even capture Cybrid weapons and equipment.
