   The time is the early 1980s. A highly placed agent in East Germany
   codenamed "Brahms Four" wants to come to the West. Brahms Four is one
   of Britain's most reliable, most valuable agents behind the Iron
   Curtain, and that he should be urgently demanding safe passage to the
   West sends a ripple of panic through the SIS. Bernard Samson, a former
   field agent, and now working behind a London desk, is tasked to
   undertake the crucial rescue. After all, it was Brahms Four who had
   once, nearly twenty years ago, saved his life.

   But even before Samson sets out on his mission, he is confronted with
   undeniable evidence that there is a traitor among his colleagues
   working for the KGB. Clearly, it is someone close to the top, close to
   Samson himself. It could be Dicky Cruyer, his incompetent supervisor -
   whom Samson despises. It could be the American Bret Rensselaer, who has
   built his entire career around the work of Brahms Four -- and who is
   spending an inordinate amount of time with Samson's wife, Fiona (also
   an intelligence officer). It could be Frank Harrington, the 'rezident'
   (head) of the Berlin field unit. In fact, it could be any member of the
   senior staff at London Central -- even the Director-General himself.

   Bernard travels to East Berlin to assist the escape of Brahms Four, and
   decides at the last moment to send Brahms Four out in his place. His
   suspicions of treachery prove well-founded when he is captured and
   subsequently confronted by his wife, who had defected and betrayed the
   operation.
