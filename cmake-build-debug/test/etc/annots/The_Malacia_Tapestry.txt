   The Malacia Tapestry is a novel about Perian de Chirolo, a poor young
   man who is both a rogue and rarely-working actor, in the imaginary city
   of Malacia, which resembles Renaissance Venice. De Chirolo lives in a
   humble attic, cadges meals and drinks in taverns, seeks love affairs
   with many women, and mingles with artists, astrologers, magicians, and
   nobility in the bustling port town. As the story opens, De Chirolo
   enjoys his free time with his young friend Guy de Lambert, who is also
   an actor. The pair pass their days drinking, jesting, and having
   affairs with women.

   Malacia has a legendary curse that it can never progress or change,
   which is enforced by a powerful Supreme Council, which also eliminates
   heretics and other freethinkers. The craftsman Otto Bengtsohn, though,
   defies the anti-progress edicts and invents a type of early
   photography. Bengtsohn uses the camera to make slides of a play, which
   is funded by the powerful and wealthy Andrus Hoytola. De Chirolo falls
   in love with Hoytola's daughter, Armida, who is acting in the play. De
   Chirolo starts a secret love affair with the wealthy Armida, but she
   tells him they cannot marry unless he achieves enough in to make an
   acceptable mate.

   Despite De Chirolo's professions of love to Armida, and their secret
   plan to marry, De Chirolo has sexual encounters with a number of women.
   De Chirolo starts to fall in love, and decides to cease his womanizing.
   As De Chirolo works with the other participants in the play, he meets
   working-class apprentices who call for progress and changes in society,
   which is against the law in Malacia. As De Chirolo tries to rise in
   Malacian society, he feels frustrated at his lack of progress in being
   accepted by the nobles.

   When Andrus Hoytola invites de Chirolo to join the annual hunt for
   "ancestral animals" (rare examples of the almost-extinct dinosaurs), de
   Chirolo is pleased to mingle with nobles and slay a seven-ton
   Devil-Jaw. However, de Chirolo's rise in Malacian society unravels when
   Andrus Hoytola learns that Bengtsohn is a Progressive who hopes that
   his zahnoscope slides can be used to foment a revolution against the
   ruling class. As the elder Hoytola suspects that de Chirolo is in
   league with Bengtsohn, de Chirolo ends up banished from society and
   Bengtsohn is killed. As the story ends, Bengtsohn's fellow Progressives
   try to recruit de Chirolo to join their plans for a class revolution.
