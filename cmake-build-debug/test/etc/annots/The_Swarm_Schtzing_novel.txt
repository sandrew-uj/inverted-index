   The book follows an ensemble of protagonists who are investigating what
   at first appear to be freak events related to the world's oceans. The
   book has several sub-plots and will occasionally follow minor unrelated
   characters to illustrate how events unfold around the globe.

   Sigur Johanson, a marine biologist working at the Norwegian University
   of Science and Technology, is asked to analyze a new species of marine
   worms, superficially related to Hesiocaeca methanicola. After several
   expeditions it becomes clear that the worms, together with bacteria,
   are destabilizing the methane clathrate in the continental shelf. When
   the continental slope collapses the subterranean landslide causes a
   tsunami that hits most of the North Sea's coasts, killing millions and
   severely damaging the infrastructure in the coastal regions.

   At the same time Leon Anawak, a marine scientist who investigates the
   behavior of whales and works for a whale watching company, makes
   startling observations in the whales' behavior; and is called to
   investigate an incident where whales and sea-borne mussels seemed to
   have attacked and incapacitated a commercial freighter.

   When he returns to his whale watching job, he witnesses how humpback
   whales and orcas attack the watcher's boats. The whales work together
   to capsize the boats and then kill the people drifting in the water.

   These events are part of a worldwide phenomenon. Several other attacks
   are briefly described in the plot: swimmers are driven from the coast
   by sharks and venomous jellyfish; commercial ships are attacked and
   sometimes destroyed; France sees an outbreak of an epidemic caused by
   lobsters contaminated with a highly lethal type of Pfiesteria.

   When it becomes clear that all those events are related, an
   international scientific task force is created under the lead of the
   United States, led by Lieutenant General Judith Li, a close friend and
   adviser to the President; the protagonists become part of it.

   While the task force is in session, the attacks on humanity continue:
   the North American east coast is overrun by Pfiesteria-infested crabs
   that attack New York City, Washington D.C., and later Boston, causing
   millions of deaths and rendering the affected cities uninhabitable. The
   Gulf Stream has also ceased to exist, an event that may initiate a
   global climate change that would threaten human civilization.

   Sigur Johanson finally announces his hypothesis: the phenomena are
   intentional attacks by an unknown sentient species from the depths of
   the oceans; he states that this is the only logical conclusion, since
   the attacks are outside the power of any human agency and cannot be a
   natural phenomenon. Johanson calls them "yrr", after three letters he
   typed randomly on his computer. The goal of the yrr is to eliminate the
   human race, which is devastating the Earth's oceans.

   General Li and a small group of scientists take to the sea on the
   helicopter carrier USS Independence in an attempt to find the yrr and
   make contact with them. They discover that the yrr are single-cell
   organisms that operate in groups (swarms), controlled by a single
   hive-mind that may have existed for hundreds of millions of years. The
   yrr form a collective intelligence and have inheritable memories that
   are passed on by manipulating parts of their DNA. Individual yrr
   recognize each other by using a specific pheromone.

   The scientists have some success in investigating the yrr and make
   limited contact. The attacks do not cease, however. Sigur Johanson also
   finds out that General Li has not been honest with them. One of the
   scientists has been working on a modified pheromone to eradicate the
   yrr completely. Johanson disagrees with this approach because the
   elimination of the yrr may completely destroy the marine ecosystem and
   thus the human race.

   Li, however, is unwilling to accept that dominance over the Earth may
   not be a God-given birthright of mankind, and the United States in
   particular. She will rather take the risk than allow the US power to
   wane. While she gives orders to have Johanson killed, the ship is
   attacked and crippled by the yrr and a final showdown ensues on the
   sinking Independence.

   Li races for the ship's DeepFlight midget submarines with two torpedoes
   containing the modified pheromone. The scientists are trying to stop
   her and at the same time implement their own plan to save humanity. She
   is stopped at the last moment by Johanson who gives his own life to
   detonate the torpedoes and kill Li.

   Karen Weaver, a scientific journalist, then manages to get hold of the
   last surviving submarine and dives into the depth of the oceans. There
   she releases a dead human pumped full of the yrr's natural pheromone,
   hoping to trigger an "emotional" response. This works and the yrr cease
   their attacks on humanity.

   The epilogue reveals that a year later, mankind is still recovering
   from the conflict with the swarm. The knowledge that humans are not the
   only intelligent lifeform on Earth has plunged most religious groups
   into chaos, while parts of the world still suffer from the epidemic the
   yrr sent to destroy the threat to their marine homeland. Humanity now
   faces the difficult task of rebuilding their society and industry
   without coming into conflict with the ever-watching superpower under
   the sea again.
