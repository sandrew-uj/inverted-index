   Queen of Angels describes our world just prior to the binary millennium
   (2048 AD) through several parallel (and to some degree interlocking)
   tales. Nanotechnology has transformed almost every aspect of American
   society, and its application to psychology, psychiatry, and
   neuroscience has resulted in new techniques for mental "therapy" that
   have created new forms of social stratification. Increasingly,
   individuals are "therapied: "by means of "nano-therapy," they are
   turned into well-integrated personalities capable of productive work
   and constructive social interaction, which does not threaten the social
   order. Therapied individuals have access to the best jobs. There are
   two other classes: the "high naturals," who possess such a positive
   mental makeup that they do not need any therapy, and the "untherapied,"
   who find themselves increasingly marginalized.

   The central unifying element involves a famous writer, Emmanuel
   Goldsmith, who has committed a gruesome series of murders, a crime
   almost unheard of in the age of therapy. One storyline involves Mary
   Choy, a high natural police detective assigned to the case to track
   down and arrest the murderer. Mary is a transform since she has chosen
   to have her body extensively altered by nanotechnology to enhance her
   abilities as a policewoman and also for aesthetic reasons.

   A second storyline involves Richard Fettle, a good friend of the
   murderer, also an untherapied writer, who must come to terms with what
   happened to his friend and how his artists' lives, and all of the
   untherapied must change. The third plot line concerns Martin Burke, a
   pioneer in psychotherapy who uses a technique which allows him to
   directly enter and interact with a patient's psychology, the "Country
   of the Mind," through a sort of virtual reality. Although disgraced at
   the story's opening, Dr. Burke is given the opportunity to use his
   technique to explore Goldsmith's mind, which turns out to be one of the
   most fascinating and dangerous minds imaginable.

   Finally, the fourth plotline considers the nature of artificial
   intelligence, as an AI robot space probe discovers life on a planet in
   the Alpha Centauri system and simultaneously achieves its own
   independent self-awareness, as does its twin back on Earth.

   The novel deals with issues of technology, identity, the nature of
   justice, and the existence of consciousness and the soul. Queen of
   Angels, set in 2047, was written just before the creation of the first
   website in 1991 and describes a global network based on the exchange of
   text (a sort of super USENET), whereas the sequel, Slant, set in 2055
   and written in 1997 after the coming of the World Wide Web, describes a
   global network which has inexplicably changed to resemble a vast shared
   virtual reality.

   Also in the novel is "Citizen Oversight," a quasi-governmental agency
   that collects data on citizens: medical, financial, legal. It also
   collects information from public sources such as video cameras with
   facial recognition and has the ability to track individuals. Local
   police agencies can appeal to Citizen Oversight to conduct a query on
   an individual and Citizen Oversight may or may not give out the
   requested information, based on their interpretation of the "Raphkind
   Amendment."
