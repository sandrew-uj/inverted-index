   It is the 22nd century, after years of war and famine of unfathomable
   level, the world is returning to normal. 12 states of the previous
   United States have joined to form the United Civilized States (UCS).
   While in Asia, a new empire was being created under the Iron Fist of
   the Khans, these Mongol descendants gave themselves a name meant to
   conjure up an association with a glorious former age: the Eurasian
   Dynasty (ED). The UCS now relied upon robots for all their needs, even
   their military is controlled by machines. GOLAN, the leader of the UCS
   military forces had recently been altered by order of the current
   President, leading to a number of glitches throughout the system. One
   of these caused it to underestimate the Eurasian Dynasty's defensive
   capacities, causing it to initiate the movement of a large force to
   occupy the British Isles. This mistake resulted in another violent war,
   lasting almost a decade. However, GOLAN managed to gain the upper hand
   against the battle-hardened Khans and so the ED resorted to the usage
   of advanced atomic weaponry. The ED attacked an encampment of UCS
   forces at the North Pole with a massive strike involving newly
   developed and untested atomic weaponry in an attempt to put a decisive
   end to the hostilities. The catastrophic resulting explosions pushed
   the Earth out of regular orbit and towards the Sun. Aware that the
   Earth's orbit has become unstable, a third faction living peacefully on
   the moon known as the Lunar Corporation (LC) joins the war in an
   attempt to defeat or reconcile both sides for the common wealth. The
   objective of the game is to collect enough resources to build an
   Evacuation Ship, allowing the player's people to journey to Mars and
   escape the looming apocalypse - foreshadowing Earth 2160.
