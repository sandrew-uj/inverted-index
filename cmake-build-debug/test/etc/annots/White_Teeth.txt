   On New Year's Day 1975, Archie Jones, a 47-year-old Englishman whose
   disturbed Italian wife has just walked out on him, is attempting to
   take his own life by gassing himself in his car when a chance
   interruption causes him to change his mind. Filled with a fresh
   enthusiasm for life, Archie flips a coin and then finds his way into
   the aftermath of a New Year's Eve party. There he meets the
   much-younger Clara Bowden, a Jamaican woman whose mother, Hortense, is
   a devout Jehovah's Witness. Clara had been interested in the
   unattractive, anti-social Ryan Topps, but their relationship falls
   apart after Ryan becomes a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. Archie
   and Clara are soon married and have a daughter, Irie, who grows up to
   be intelligent but with low self-confidence.

   Also living in Willesden, London, is Archie's best friend Samad Iqbal,
   a Bengali Muslim from Bangladesh; the two men spend much of their time
   at the O'Connell's pub. Archie and Samad met in 1945 when they were
   part of a tank crew inching through Europe in the final days of World
   War II, though they missed out on the action. Following the war, Samad
   emigrated to Britain and married Alsana Iqbal, nee Alsana Begum, or
   "Miss Alsana," in a traditional arranged marriage. Samad is a
   downtrodden waiter in a West End curry house, and is obsessed by the
   history of his supposed but unlikely great-grandfather, Mangal Pandey,
   a Hindu soldier from Uttar Pradesh, not Bengal, who is famous for
   firing the first shot of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (though he
   missed). Samad and Alsana have twin boys, Magid and Millat, who are the
   same age as Irie. Samad in particular finds it difficult to maintain
   his devotion to Islam in an English life; he is continually tormented
   by what he sees as the effects of this cultural conflict upon his own
   moral character--his Muslim values are corrupted by his masturbation,
   drinking, and his affair with his children's music teacher, Poppy
   Burt-Jones. In an attempt to preserve his traditional beliefs, he sends
   10-year-old Magid to Bangladesh in the hope that he will grow up
   properly under the teachings of Islam. From then on, the lives of the
   two boys follow very different paths. To Samad's fury, Magid becomes an
   Anglicised atheist and devotes his life to science. Millat, meanwhile,
   pursues a rebellious path of womanising and drinking--as well as
   harbouring a love of mob movies such as The Godfather and Goodfellas.
   Angry at his people's marginalisation in English society Millat
   demonstrates against Salman Rushdie in 1989 and eventually pledges
   himself to a militant Muslim fundamentalist brotherhood known as
   "Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation" (KEVIN).

   The lives of the Joneses and Iqbals intertwine with that of the white,
   middle-class Chalfens, a Jewish-Catholic family of Oxbridge-educated
   intellectuals who typify a distinctive strain of North London liberal
   trendiness. The father, Marcus Chalfen, is a university lecturer and
   geneticist working on a controversial 'FutureMouse' project in which he
   introduces chemical carcinogens into the body of a mouse and is thus
   able to observe the progression of a tumour in living tissue. By
   re-engineering the actual genome and watching cancers progress at
   pre-determined times, Marcus believes he is eliminating the random. The
   mother, Joyce Chalfen, is a horticulturist and part-time housewife with
   an often entirely misguided desire to mother and 'heal' Millat as if he
   were one of her plants. To some extent, the Chalfen family provides a
   safe haven as they (believe themselves to) accept and understand the
   turbulent lives of Irie, Magid, and Millat. However, this sympathy
   comes at the expense of their own son, Joshua, whose difficulties are
   ignored by his parents. Originally a well-moulded "Chalfenist", Joshua
   later rebels against his father and his background by joining the
   radical animal rights group "Fighting Animal Torture and Exploitation"
   (FATE). Meanwhile, after his return from Bangladesh, Magid works as
   Marcus's research assistant on the FutureMouse project, while Millat
   becomes further involved in KEVIN. Irie, who has been working for
   Marcus, briefly succeeds in her long-hidden attraction to Millat but is
   rejected under his KEVIN-inspired beliefs. Irie believes that Millat
   cannot love her, for he has always been "the second son" both
   symbolically and literally; Millat was born two minutes after Magid.
   Irie makes Magid the "second son" for a change by sleeping with him
   right after her romantic encounter of Millat. This causes her to become
   pregnant, and she is left unsure of the father of her child, as the
   brothers are identical twins.

   The strands of the narrative grow closer as Millat and KEVIN, Joshua
   and FATE, and Clara's mother Hortense and the Jehovah's Witnesses all
   plan to demonstrate their opposition to Marcus's FutureMouse--which
   they view as an evil interference with their own beliefs--at its
   exhibition on New Year's Eve 1992. At the Perret Institute, Hortense
   and the other Jehovah's Witnesses sing loudly in the hallway. Samad
   goes out to hush them, but when he arrives, doesn't have the heart to
   make them stop. When he returns, it suddenly strikes him that the
   founder of the Perret Institute and the oldest scientist on Marcus
   Chalfen's panel is Dr Perret, the Nazi he captured during World War II.
   Enraged that Archie did not kill him all those years ago, Samad runs
   over and begins cursing Archie. Just then, Millat advances on the table
   of scientists with a gun. Without thinking, Archie jumps in front of
   him and takes a bullet in the thigh. As he falls, he knocks over the
   mouse's glass cage, and it escapes.

   At the novel's end, the narrator presents us with different "end games"
   in the style of television. Magid and Millat both serve community
   service for Millat's crime, since witnesses identify both as the
   culprit. Joshua and Irie end up together and join Hortense in Jamaica
   in the year 2000. Mickey opens up the previously men-only O'Connell's
   pub to women, and Archie and Samad finally invite their wives along
   with them.
