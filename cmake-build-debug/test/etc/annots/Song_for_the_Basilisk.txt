   The sole survivor of a massacre, Caladrius, nicknamed Rook, has been
   living with the bards of Luly since the day he was rescued from the
   smoldering remains of his home. Despite falling in love and having a
   son, Caladrius is unable to make peace with his memories, and so
   ventures into the world to discover how his family was destroyed - and
   why. He learns his true name: he is Griffin Tormalyne from the house of
   Griffin, which was crushed by Arioso Pellior, the patriarch of the
   house of Basilisk and tyrant of the city of Berylon.

   In Berylon, Caladrius enters Pellior's house as a music teacher for
   Pellior's decidedly un-musical daughter. As Griffin tutors Damiet
   Pellior for an upcoming opera, the city's musicians hatch their own
   plots. Armed with his picochet, a single-stringed instrument played by
   peasants, and a small bone pipe, Griffin challenges the Basilisk and
   exacts his revenge. But his revenge is not complete. Arioso Pellior is
   stricken, but not dead. Pellior names his other daughter, Luna, a
   powerful magician who has been his apprentice all her life, as his
   heir. Unexpectedly, Luna declares that thirty-seven years of torturing
   Tourmalyne House are enough. Hearing this, her father dies of anger.
   Luna begins to help Caladrius restore Tormalyne House.
