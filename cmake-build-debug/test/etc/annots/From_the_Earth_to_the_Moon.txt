   Edition.
   The firing of the Columbiad.

   The story opens some time after the end of the American Civil War. The
   Baltimore Gun Club, a society dedicated to the design of weapons of all
   kinds (especially cannons), comes together when Impey Barbicane, its
   president, calls them to support his latest idea. He's done some
   calculations, and believes that they could construct a cannon capable
   of shooting a projectile to the Moon. After receiving the support of
   his companions, another meeting is held to decide the place from which
   the projectile will be fired, the dimensions and materials of both the
   cannon and the projectile, and which kind of powder they are to use.

   An old enemy of Barbicane, a Captain Nicholl of Philadelphia, designer
   of plate armor, declares that the entire enterprise is absurd and makes
   a series of bets with Barbicane, each of them of increasing amount,
   over the impossibility of such feat.

   The first obstacle, the money to construct the giant cannon (and
   against which Nicholl has bet 1,000 dollars), is raised from a number
   of countries in America and Europe. Notably, the U.S. gives four
   million dollars, while England,at first, does not give a farthing, but
   in the end, nearly five and a half million dollars are raised, which
   ensures the financial feasibility of the project.

   Stone's Hill in "Tampa Town", Florida is chosen as the site for the
   cannon's construction. The Gun Club travels there and starts the
   construction of the Columbiad cannon, which requires the excavation of
   a 900-foot-deep (270 m) and 60-foot-wide (18 m) circular hole, which is
   made in the nick of time, but a surprise awaits Barbicane: Michel
   Ardan, a French adventurer, plans to travel aboard the projectile.

   During a meeting between Ardan, the Gun Club, and the inhabitants of
   Florida, Nicholl appears and challenges Barbicane to a duel. The duel
   is stopped when Ardan--having been warned by J. T. Maston, secretary of
   the Gun Club--meets the rivals in the forest where they have agreed to
   duel. Meanwhile, Barbicane finds the solution to the problem of
   surviving the incredible acceleration that the explosion would cause.
   Ardan suggests that Barbicane and Nicholl travel with him in the
   projectile, and the proposition is accepted.

   In the end, the projectile is successfully launched, but the destinies
   of the three astronauts are left inconclusive. The sequel, Around the
   Moon, deals with what happens to the three men in their travel from the
   Earth to the Moon.
