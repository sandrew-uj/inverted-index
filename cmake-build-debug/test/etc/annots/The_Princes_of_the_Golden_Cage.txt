   Prince Amir lives in a lavish and beautiful cage. He lives in a palace
   with hundreds of his brothers, all barred by law from ever leaving the
   palace until he, or one of his brothers, becomes the next Sultan.
   Living under constant threat of death at the hands of his scheming
   brothers, Amir has chosen a life of solitude and study. His scholarly
   and alchemical pursuits bring him under suspicion when his brothers
   begin to die from seemingly supernatural means. Amir finds himself
   thrown together with his brother Erik, the son of a barbarian princess.
   Together they must discover the dark secret that is stalking the halls
   of their golden cage.
