   Jarrod and his wife Elaine arrive in Los Angeles, California for
   Jarrod's best friend Terry's birthday party. They celebrate with
   Terry's wife, Candice, and his assistant, Denise. During a private
   argument about whether or not they should move, Elaine reveals she is
   pregnant.

   The next morning, blue lights descend from the sky, hypnotizing anyone
   who looks at them. The light causes people to become zombie-like and
   immobilized; they are then collected by the light machines. Jarrod and
   Elaine's friend Ray is taken, but Jarrod is saved when Terry tackles
   him. He and Terry go to the condominium roof to investigate the lights
   but are attacked by one of hundreds of flying alien drones. As they
   attempt to open the rooftop door, Elaine quickly opens it from the
   other side, accidentally looks directly into the aliens' light and is
   hypnotized, but Jarrod and Terry are able to save her and close the
   door.

   Back in the condominium, Terry looks for his neighbor Walt so they can
   all leave in Walt's car. As Terry and Walt are hiding, Walt's dog runs
   towards the creature and Walt tries to stop it but he gets abducted.
   Jarrod believes the open water would be a safer place, since there are
   no machines over the sea. They encounter a bickering couple, Colin and
   Jen, also preparing to flee the building. As Terry's car exits the
   garage, it is flattened by a massive four-legged alien, killing Denise.
   Terry escapes, but is abducted as he flees. The trio retreat into the
   garage, where they encounter another alien lifeform in the shape of a
   large multi-tentacled squid that takes Colin and corners the rest of
   the group before the building's concierge, Oliver, slams into it with
   an SUV and finds Colin alive. When they try to free him, the squid
   creature comes back to life, sucking out Colin's brain and replacing
   its own brain with it. Jen joins the group, but is abducted as they run
   back into the building. The four survivors remain hiding in the
   condominium.

   The next day, the United States Air Force launches an attack against
   the alien spaceship and flying alien drones using stealth unmanned
   combat aerial vehicles and conventional drone aircraft armed with
   air-to-air missiles. Only one stealth plane pierces the carnage and
   fires a nuclear missile, hitting the mothership, before it is
   destroyed. The detonation blows the ship apart and kills the aliens,
   but Jarrod discovered the aliens have survived and the ship slowly
   begins to repair itself. After Jarrod tells Elaine that the alien light
   made him feel powerful, he is adamant that safety must be found
   outside. Oliver wants to stay inside and tries restraining him. Jarrod
   physically starts changing as he lifts Oliver off the floor and vows
   that he will protect his family.

   Helicopters arrive with soldiers as Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof
   hoping to catch a ride to safety. Oliver and Candice stay in the
   condominium, but are found when Candice accidentally exposes herself to
   the light and is abducted. Afterwards, Oliver attempts to kill a tanker
   alien by turning on a gas stove and igniting a lighter, causing the
   room to explode. The soldiers are thrown off the roof by the aliens and
   a squid alien attacks Jarrod and Elaine; the badly injured Jarrod kills
   it. Amid the aliens, they accept their fate, look into the blue light,
   and are sucked into the mother ship. A brief montage shows that cities
   such as London, Hong Kong and New York City have all succumbed to the
   invasion and the aliens appear to have won.

   Inside the alien ship, Elaine wakes on a pile of human bodies. Tubes
   are sucking human brains into machines; probes go through the pile
   looking for what they can find. Elaine sees Jarrod in the pile but has
   to watch helplessly as his brain is removed. She is probed, but left
   alone since she is pregnant. Elaine is transported to another chamber
   where other pregnant women have been sent. Meanwhile, Jarrod's brain,
   glowing red instead of the usual aliens' blue, is inserted into a new
   alien body. Animating the alien body, Jarrod seems to retain control,
   and comes to the aid of Elaine and their unborn child. Elaine
   recognizes him when he caresses her belly and her head. He then turns
   around to confront advancing aliens, and in between the credits, a
   series of still images depict "Jarrod" protecting Elaine and their
   child from the aliens.
