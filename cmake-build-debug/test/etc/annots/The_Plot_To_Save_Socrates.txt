   Alcibiades, who got to live a long and eventful life past the moment
   when history recorded his death

   The Plot to Save Socrates deals primarily with the concept of time
   travel, and while the novel rarely discusses time travel directly, it
   poses several questions about its validity and possibility (or lack
   thereof). In particular, the characters are trapped in endless time
   loops, effectively deprived of free will and having no choice but to
   take an action which - due to time travel - they already know they have
   taken.

   The story begins in Athens, Greece in 2042 with the main character,
   Sierra Waters, thinking to herself, at which point the rest of the
   story begins as a flashback (both in her head and in the sense that the
   characters constantly flash in and out of historic eras).

   Sierra Waters, a graduate student, receives a copy of a previously
   unknown dialogue in which Socrates is being offered an escape from his
   death sentence in ancient Athens by a person named Andros offering to
   take him into the future and leave a clone behind.

   The document appears to be genuine, and this takes Sierra onto a path
   that leads her to a time traveling adventure of her own. On her path
   she meets up with the great historic inventor Heron of Alexandria but
   soon realizes that not only is Heron a time traveler himself (from a
   future later than hers) but is a suspicious and ruthless character.
   Later on she would encounter the renowned Athenian general Alcibiades,
   help save his life at the time when history records his death in 404
   BC, become his lover and fall deeply in love with him, and help set him
   on a very extensive and fruitful later long life which would remain
   unknown to historians.

   Together with various fictional characters, the story also involves
   Plato, and of course Socrates - who only comes onstage in the last part
   - as well as the 19th Century publisher William Henry Appleton. There
   are scenes across time, placed in the Ancient Library of Alexandria,
   Victorian New York City, and Roman London.

   At various points it is mentioned that Sierra Waters would eventually
   become the famous mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria. This theme is
   taken up in a sequel, Unburning Alexandria, of which the first two
   chapters were published as a standalone novelette in the November 2008
   issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact.^[1]^[2] The full-length novel
   was published as a trade paperback and ebook in 2013,^[3] followed by
   the next novel in the series, Chronica, in December 2014.^[4]^[5]
