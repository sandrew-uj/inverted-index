   The novel unfolds in alternating chapters from the points of view of
   the four main characters. Andrew Compton, a convicted serial killer
   (based on serial killer Dennis Nilsen), escapes his UK prison cell in a
   self-induced cataleptic trance. Mistaken for dead by the authorities,
   he makes his way to New Orleans' French Quarter to start a new life.
   Seeking new victims, he instead meets Jay Byrne (based on Jeffrey
   Dahmer), a wealthy recluse who is also a serial killer, as well as a
   cannibal. The two at first intend to victimize one another, but upon
   realizing their similar proclivities, instead begin a torrid affair
   based on sex and murder.

   After learning that he is HIV-positive, writer Lucas Ransom reacts by
   rejecting all his former friends and breaking up with his teenage lover
   Tran. Increasingly embittered by his illness, Lucas vents his
   frustration through his alternate persona "Lush Rimbaud", host of a
   pirate radio program (in a pirate station with the callsign "WHIV")
   where Lucas rails at society's denial of gay men and the AIDS epidemic
   (coincidently, the callsign would be used in real life for a licensed
   station in New Orleans that chose the call letters specifically to
   remove stigma about HIV/AIDS but with no other relation to Brite's
   novel). Soon even this outlet isn't enough, and Lucas, sensing that
   death is approaching, becomes fixated on reconciling with Tran.

   Meanwhile, Tran is driven from his home after his parents learn that he
   is gay. Tran, who previously had a casual acquaintance with Jay, takes
   refuge at Jay's home, where the two have a brief sexual encounter. Jay
   finds himself emotionally drawn to the beautiful, vulnerable Tran but
   refuses to pursue him any further because he cannot conceive of a
   relationship that does not end in death. When Jay introduces Tran to
   Andrew, Andrew becomes obsessed with the idea of murdering and eating
   him. Jay, though reluctant, agrees to Andrew's plan, in part to rid
   himself of the temptation of falling in love with Tran. The two kidnap
   Tran and begin to slowly torture him to death.

   Lucas realizes that Tran has fallen into Andrew and Jay's deadly hands,
   and the goal becomes not reuniting with Tran, but rescuing him.
   Arriving too late to save him, Lucas murders Jay and confronts Andrew.
   Recognizing that Lucas is already on the verge of death, Andrew refuses
   to kill him, instead offering him several means to commit suicide.
   Lucas realizes that his life, no matter how short, is still of value to
   him and flees, telling no one what he has seen.

   After partially consuming Jay in a final act of love, Andrew leaves New
   Orleans to continue his murderous career, while Lucas, returning home,
   vows to spend his remaining time writing a novel to try to make sense
   of what he has witnessed.
