   The backward land of Andur-Kursh is split into many cantons, each with
   ambitious clans vying for power. The loyalty of a warrior of the
   nobility is given to one's clan. Vanye is one of them, if only the
   barely tolerated bastard son of the ruler of one of these cantons, the
   result of a mere night's amusement by a Nhi lord with a captive from an
   enemy clan, the Chya.

   One day, he is brought before his father, after killing one legitimate
   half-brother and maiming the other with his sword, in a baiting that
   had gone awry. After turning down honorable suicide, he is made ilin,
   an exiled, clanless warrior akin to the Japanese ronin.

   Hunted by his half-brothers' vengeful maternal clan, Vanye is forced to
   enter Morgaine's vale, a place anyone less desperate would have
   shunned. By chance, he releases Morgaine, a beautiful woman of
   distinctive appearance, from the Gate there. Vanye recognizes her as a
   legend from the past. It is winter and Vanye is weary, cold and hungry.
   So when Morgaine provides food and shelter, he accepts them. Only then
   does he remember that she, alone of all women, has been given
   lord-right; she can and does claim a year of service from him in return
   for accepting her hospitality.

   Morgaine is determined to complete the mission she and four companions
   had set out on a century before: to close the master Gate at Ivrel. She
   explains to Vanye that the Gates that dot the land are passageways
   through both space and time. One hundred men and women had been sent by
   the Union Science Bureau on a one-way mission to close all the Gates,
   lest humanity suffer the fate of another species. The qujal had found
   the Gates and tapped their powers to rule an interstellar empire of
   lesser beings, including humans. But one reckless fool had succumbed to
   temptation and gone back in time, triggering a cataclysm that had
   wrecked qujal civilization.

   After many years, the last five Union survivors had reached this world
   and recruited allies to attack Thiye Thiye's-son, the master of the
   Gate of Ivrel. But they were betrayed and nearly their entire army was
   swallowed up by the Gate; only Morgaine and a few soldiers, bringing up
   the rear, survived. Fleeing before the enemy, she had been forced to
   seek refuge in a lesser Gate, there to wait in stasis until freed.

   She seeks aid from Clan Leth, a former staunch ally, but finds it
   greatly changed and its lord, Kasedre, half mad. His chief counselor,
   Chya Liell, comes to them late at night and warns them to leave before
   harm befalls them, killing a guard to give them no choice in the
   matter. Privately, Liell tries to persuade Vanye to desert Morgaine.

   Morgaine and Vanye travel into neighboring Chya lands and find
   themselves uneasy guests of Chya Roh, Vanye's cousin. After questioning
   and some rest, they are let go, only to be attacked by Thiye's men.
   Morgaine is forced to draw her sword, Changeling, which turns out to be
   more than it seems; it can tap the power of the Gates to send its
   victims elsewhere. The two manage to escape, but run into a Nhi band.
   Rather than chance another fight, the wounded Morgaine orders Vanye to
   bargain for shelter and protection. She is set free, though without her
   sword, while he is forced to remain behind by his brother Erij, now the
   lord of Nhi. Erij wants his brother to help him rule, knowing him to be
   trustworthy and bound to him by blood. When persuasion and threats
   alike prove useless, he draws Changeling, not knowing its powers. Vanye
   takes advantage of the ensuing mayhem to retrieve the dropped sword and
   escape to rejoin Morgaine.

   Roh had warned him not to trust Liell, whose body (rumor said) had been
   taken over by another. Morgaine confirms that such a thing can be done
   using a Gate. She knows that Thiye has prolonged his life by this
   method and suspects her century-old betrayer also still lives. The aged
   Liell's attempt to suborn Vanye suddenly takes on a more sinister
   aspect.

   After another clash with Nhi warriors, Morgaine is personally escorted
   by Roh out of his domain. Fearing her intentions, he knocks out a
   too-trusting Vanye when Morgaine is asleep and ties them both up, but
   his timing could not have been worse. Liell and his men easily capture
   all three. He takes Vanye to a Gate, intent on switching bodies. The
   unease of Liell's men in the unnerving presence of the Gate allows
   Vanye to escape. By chance, the horse he steals is carrying Changeling.
   But Vanye's luck still runs bad; he is caught again, this time by his
   brother Erij.

   Erij, emboldened by his possession of Changeling and for a variety of
   reasons, allows himself to be persuaded to go to Ivrel. After driving
   off Liell's men with the deadly sword, they reach Thiye's fortress.
   They wait for night before Erij uses Changeling to force their way in.
   Vanye then takes his brother by surprise and retakes Morgaine's sword.
   In mortal danger, Erij has no choice, but to guard his back. Inside,
   they come upon the aged Thiye, but before they can react, the old man
   is killed by Roh. Roh informs them that Morgaine is loose in the
   fortress and that Liell is dead. He warns them to flee while they still
   can, then follows his own advice.

   Vanye finds Morgaine and surrenders the sword to her, much to Erij's
   dismay. She confirms Vanye's suspicion; Roh's body now houses Liell's
   mind. Fearing Morgaine, Roh/Liell had sabotaged the Gate controls so
   that he could escape to another world, leaving his enemies trapped
   here. But Morgaine believes that he left too much of a safety margin
   before the Gates on this world close forever and that she can follow
   him. She departs in all haste. Erij surprisingly bids his brother to go
   after her and Vanye gratefully complies. Together, Morgaine and Vanye
   pass through the Gate.
