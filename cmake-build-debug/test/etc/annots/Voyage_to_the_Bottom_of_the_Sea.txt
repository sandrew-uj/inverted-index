   The new, state-of-the-art nuclear submarine, Seaview, is on diving
   trials in the Arctic Ocean. Seaview is designed and built by scientist
   and engineering genius Admiral Harriman Nelson (USN-Ret) (Walter
   Pidgeon). Captain Lee Crane (Robert Sterling) is the submarine's
   Commanding Officer. One of the on-board observers is Dr. Susan Hiller
   (Joan Fontaine), studying crew-related stress. The mission includes
   being out of radio contact for 96 hours while under the Arctic ice cap.
   The polar ice suddenly begins to crack and melt, with boulder-size
   pieces crashing into the ocean around the submerged submarine;
   surfacing, they discover the sky is on fire. After rescuing scientist
   Miguel Alvarez (Michael Ansara) and his dog at Ice Floe Delta, Seaview
   receives radio contact from Mission Director Inspector Bergan at the
   Bureau of Marine Exploration. He reports that a meteor shower has
   pierced the Van Allen radiation belt, causing it to catch on fire,
   resulting in a deadly increase in the global temperature. Nelson's
   on-board friend and scientist, retired Commodore Lucius Emery (Peter
   Lorre), concurs it is possible.

   The President summons Admiral Nelson to a UN Emergency Scientific
   meeting. Nelson and Commodore Emery have devised a plan to end the
   catastrophe. Seaview arrives in New York Harbor two days later. Nelson
   informs the UN that, according to their calculations, if the increasing
   temperature is not stopped, it will become irreversible and the Earth
   will die in about three weeks. The Admiral and the Commander propose
   extinguishing the fire by launching a nuclear missile at the burning
   belt from the Mariana Islands. A nuclear explosion should overwhelm and
   extinguish the flames, "amputating" the belt from the Earth. Seaview
   has the capability of firing the missile. The chief scientist and head
   delegate, Vienna's Emilio Zucco (Henry Daniell) rejects the Admiral's
   plan as too risky. He believes the composition of the belt's gasses
   will cause the fire to soon burn itself out when reaching 173 degrees.
   Nelson disagrees with Zucco's theory, claiming that his estimated
   burn-out point is incorrect. Nelson and Emery's plan is rejected. The
   Admiral and the Commodore quickly leave the proceedings intending to
   get authorization directly from the President himself.

   The Seaview races to reach the optimal firing position above the
   Pacific Ocean's Marianas trench in time for the needed angle of
   trajectory. Nelson and Crane attempt tapping the Rio-to-London
   telephone cable in an attempt to reach the President. An unsuccessful
   attempt on the Admiral's life indicates a saboteur is aboard. The
   rescued scientist, Miguel Alvarez, a religious zealot regarding the
   catastrophe, is the suspected saboteur. Dr. Hiller privately supports
   Dr Zucco's plan. Other obstacles present themselves: the sub narrowly
   escaptes minefield and the crew are near-mutiny. Crane begins doubting
   the Admiral's tactics and reasoning. During the cable tapping attempt,
   Crane and Alvarez battle a giant squid. They can only tap into the
   London cable, and Nelson learns there has been no contact with the U.S.
   for 35 hours. A hostile, unidentified submarine pursues them, diving
   deep into the Mariana Trench, exceeding its crush depth; the sub
   implodes before it can destroy Seaview.

   The saboteur has shut down the sub's power. Crane encounters Dr Hiller,
   the saboteur, atop the shark tank, as she exits the restricted nuclear
   reactor core. Her radiation detector badge has turned red, showing she
   has been exposed to a fatal dose. When asked why, she says to prevent
   the sub from reaching its target. Suddenly an explosion rocks the sub,
   throwing Dr. Hiller into the shark tank, she falls in and is killed by
   the sharks. The Admiral learns that temperatures are rising faster than
   projected, proving Zucco's theory is incorrect. Alvarez, believing it
   is God's will for the Earth to be destroyed, attempts to sabotage the
   mission by threatening to explode a bomb. Crane, in SCUBA gear,
   launches the nuclear missile from outside the sub before Alvarez is
   aware.

   Seaview reaches the Mariana Islands, and over Alvarez's threats and
   objections, a nuclear missile is launched toward the belt. It explodes,
   driving the burning flames away from the Earth and saving humanity.
