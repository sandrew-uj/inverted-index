   David Quixano emigrates to America in the wake of the 1903 Chisinau
   pogrom in which his entire family is killed. He writes a great symphony
   called "The Crucible" expressing his hope for a world in which all
   ethnicity has melted away, and falls in love with a beautiful Russian
   Christian immigrant named Vera. The dramatic peak of the play is the
   moment when David meets Vera's father, who turns out to be the Russian
   officer responsible for the annihilation of David's family. Vera's
   father admits his guilt, the symphony is performed to accolades, David
   and Vera agree to wed and kiss as the curtain falls.
