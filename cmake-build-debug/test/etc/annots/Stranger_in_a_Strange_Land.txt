   The story focuses on a human raised on Mars and his adaptation to and
   understanding of humans and their culture. It is set in a post-Third
   World War United States, where organized religions are politically
   powerful. There is a World Federation of Free Nations, including the
   demilitarized US, with a world government supported by Special Service
   troops.

   Prior to WWIII the manned spacecraft Envoy is launched toward Mars, but
   all contact is lost shortly before landing. Twenty-five years later,
   the spacecraft Champion makes contact with the inhabitants of Mars and
   finds a single survivor, Valentine Michael Smith. Born on the Envoy, he
   was raised entirely by the Martians. He is ordered by them to accompany
   the returning expedition.

   Because Smith is unaccustomed to the conditions on Earth, he is
   confined at Bethesda Hospital, where, having never seen a human female,
   he is attended by male staff only. Seeing that restriction as a
   challenge, Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes the guards and goes in to see
   Smith. By sharing a glass of water with him, she inadvertently becomes
   his first "water brother", which is considered to be a profound
   relationship by the Martians as water on Mars is extremely scarce.

   Gillian tells her lover, reporter Ben Caxton, about her experience with
   Smith. Ben explains that as heir to the entire exploration party, Smith
   is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the
   colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself.
   His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts
   his life in danger. Ben persuades her to bug Smith's room and publishes
   stories to bait the government into releasing him. Ben is seized by the
   government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her.
   When government agents catch up with them, Smith makes the agents
   vanish and then is so shocked by Gillian's terrified reaction that he
   enters a semblance of catatonia. Gillian, remembering Ben's earlier
   suggestion, conveys Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author who is also
   a physician and a lawyer.

   Smith continues to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman
   intelligence, coupled with a childlike naivete. When Harshaw tries to
   explain religion to him, Smith understands the concept of God only as
   "one who groks", which includes every extant organism. That leads him
   to express the Martian concept of life as the phrase "Thou art God"
   although he knows that to be a bad translation. Many other human
   concepts such as war, clothing, and jealousy are strange to him, and
   the idea of an afterlife is a fact that he takes for granted because
   Martian society is directed by "Old Ones", the spirits of Martians who
   have "discorporated". It is also customary for loved ones and friends
   to eat the bodies of the dead in a rite similar to Holy Communion.
   Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that
   human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no
   applicability to a planet that is already inhabited by intelligent
   life.

   Still inexhaustibly wealthy and now free to travel, Smith becomes a
   celebrity and is feted by the Earth's elite. He investigates many
   religions, including the Fosterite Church of the New Revelation, a
   populist megachurch in which sexuality, gambling, alcohol consumption,
   and similar activities are allowed and even encouraged and considered
   "sinning" only when they are not under church auspices. The Church of
   the New Revelation is organized in a complexity of initiatory levels:
   an outer circle, open to the public; a middle circle of ordinary
   members, who support the church financially; and an inner circle of the
   "eternally saved", attractive, highly sexed men and women, who serve as
   clergy and recruit new members. The Church owns many politicians and
   uses violence against those who oppose it. Smith also has a brief
   career as a magician in a carnival (performing actual miracles), in
   which he and Gillian befriend the show's tattooed lady, an "eternally
   saved" Fosterite named Patricia Paiwonski.

   Eventually, Smith starts a Martian-influenced "Church of All Worlds",
   combining elements of the Fosterite cult (especially the sexual
   aspects) with Western esotericism, whose members learn the Martian
   language and thus acquire the ability to truly "grok" the nature of
   reality, granting them psychokinesis. The church is eventually besieged
   by Fosterites for practicing "blasphemy", and the church building is
   destroyed, but unknown to the public, Smith's followers teleport to
   safety. Smith is arrested by the police, but escapes and returns to his
   followers, later explaining to Jubal that his gigantic fortune has been
   bequeathed to the Church. With that wealth and their new abilities,
   Church members will be able to reorganize human societies and cultures.
   Eventually, those who cannot or will not learn Smith's methods will die
   out, leaving Homo Superior. That incidentally may save Earth from
   eventual destruction by the Martians, who were responsible for the
   destruction of the fifth planet eons ago (resulting in the asteroid
   belt).

   Smith is killed by a mob raised against him by the Fosterites. From the
   afterlife, he speaks briefly to grief-stricken Jubal to dissuade him
   from suicide. Having consumed a small portion of Smith's remains in
   keeping with Martian custom, Jubal and some of the Church members
   return to Jubal's home to regroup and prepare for their new evangelical
   role founding congregations. Meanwhile, Smith reappears in the
   afterlife to replace the Fosterites' eponymous founder, amid hints that
   Smith was an incarnation of the Archangel Michael.
