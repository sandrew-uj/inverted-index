   Following the events at the end of The Enemy of the World, Jamie
   manages to close the TARDIS' doors, stabilising its flight. The TARDIS
   materialises in deep space; an unseen entity enshrouds the ship in a
   web-like substance. As the web clears, the Second Doctor operates a
   device to land the TARDIS away from its original flight course,
   bringing it to Covent Garden tube station. The station is in darkness
   and deserted, with the city outside appearing completely abandoned.

   Approximately 40 years after his Tibetan expedition in The Abominable
   Snowmen, an elderly Professor Travers reactivates a control sphere
   during his studies. The sphere inserts into an intact robot Yeti from
   Tibet at a private collection in London and escapes. In the following
   days, London is beset by thick fog and a deadly web-like fungus begins
   to infest the London Underground. Professor Travers is brought to the
   Second World War deep-level shelter under Goodge Street tube station,
   where his daughter Anne has asked for his help to defeat the menace
   affecting the tube system. Also present are Captain Knight, the current
   leader of the military manning HQ, Staff-Sergeant Arnold, who acts as
   Knight's deputy and Harold Chorley, the only journalist allowed to
   report on the crisis.

   Moving through the underground train tunnels, the Doctor and his
   companions encounter the military, who are trying to stem the spread of
   the fungus by demolishing tunnels with explosives. Explosives laid at
   Charing Cross tube station are neutralised by the robot Yeti
   by smothering the explosion with the fungus using web-spraying guns.
   The reappearance of the Yeti signifies to the Doctor that the Great
   Intelligence has returned and redirected the TARDIS' flight in order to
   bring him to the Underground as part of its plans to conquer the Earth.
   Knight, Arnold and Chorley are initially suspicious of the Doctor,
   Jamie and Victoria, believing them to be responsible for sabotaging the
   explosion. Professor Travers, recognising them from their encounter in
   Tibet, convinces Knight that the Doctor will be key to defeating the
   Yeti.

   The group are joined by Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart and Private Evans,
   the sole survivors of an ammunition detail which was attacked by Yeti
   at Holborn tube station. Lethbridge-Stewart assumes command of HQ from
   Knight. The web expands enormously, engulfing the whole of the Circle
   Line. Further attempts to use explosives to halt the web are blocked by
   Yeti attacks, and the military's explosives store is consumed by the
   fungus. The Doctor discovers a Yeti-attracting beacon at the scene,
   convincing him that someone at HQ must be in league with the
   Intelligence. Meanwhile, Chorley, who intends to desert and flee, is
   told of the TARDIS by Victoria and he rushes off to Covent Garden to
   find it; the Doctor, Jamie, Victoria and Evans rush to intercept him.
   When they reach Covent Garden, the Doctor's party discover it to be
   barred off by fungus. While they are gone, the base is attacked by
   Yeti, killing several of the soldiers and knocking out Anne and
   Professor Travers. The Yeti then leave with Professor Travers'
   unconscious body.

   On returning, the group find Anne unconscious and Travers gone. The
   Doctor informs Lethbridge-Stewart and Knight about the intelligence and
   the TARDIS; the Colonel decides to recover the TARDIS from Covent
   Garden station, hoping that it will allow them to escape. The Colonel
   leads the remaining troops overground to Covent Garden, while Arnold,
   Evans and a third soldier, Corporal Lane, take a baggage trolley
   through the underground at the same time to transport the TARDIS on.
   The Doctor and Anne attempt to build a control box to block the signal
   between the Intelligence and the control spheres, though the Doctor
   finds that they are low on components and is escorted above ground by
   Knight to find more.

   Arnold and Lane put on gas masks and attempt to go through the fungus
   blocking Covent Garden with the baggage trolley, but when they enter
   the web Evans hears piercing screams. On pulling the trolley out on a
   rope, Evans finds Lane dead and Arnold gone. On the surface, the Yeti
   ambush the soldiers at Covent Garden. Despite downing several robots in
   the ensuing battle, all except Lethbridge-Stewart perish. At an
   electronics store on the surface, Knight is killed in a Yeti attack,
   though the robots leave the Doctor alone. He discovers a Yeti beacon in
   Knight's pocket, which brought them to the shop. Later, the Colonel
   returns to HQ alone where the Doctor finds a model Yeti in his pocket.
   The Doctor deduces that the traitor in HQ slipped the beacon onto the
   Colonel and Knight. At that moment, two Yeti break in with Professor
   Travers, who is possessed by the Great Intelligence.

   Through the controlled Professor Travers, the Great Intelligence
   explains that it brought the Doctor to London in order to drain his
   mind of all his knowledge of time and space. Unless he submits to the
   Intelligence, it will drain the minds of Jamie and Victoria instead.
   The Intelligence gives the Doctor 20 minutes to submit. Travers is
   released from the Intelligence's control and is taken as a hostage by
   the Yeti along with Victoria at Piccadilly Circus tube station. The
   Doctor and Anne work on the control box further and successfully
   reprogram a control sphere, which they load into a disabled Yeti to
   make a covert, voice-controlled ally within the Intelligence's ranks.

   Staff-Sergeant Arnold, who turns up dishevelled and bleeding, having
   somehow survived, links up with the Colonel and Jamie in the tunnels.
   All three agree to return to HQ to support the Doctor, though they find
   that he and Anne have left while searching for a Yeti to reprogram. At
   that moment, the fungus bursts through the walls of HQ, swamping Goodge
   Street shelter. Lethbridge-Stewart, Jamie, Arnold and Evans meet up
   with the Doctor and Anne, before the group is ambushed by the Yeti, who
   herd them to Piccadilly tube station. Arnold slips away and meets
   Chorley, who has been wandering the tube network and has become
   hysterical with fright.

   At the ticket hall of Piccadilly station, the group rejoins with
   Travers and Victoria. Chorley and Arnold appear and Arnold is revealed
   to be the traitor, having been killed and his corpse reanimated as a
   vessel for the Intelligence. The Doctor appears to submit to the
   Intelligence and places himself inside a pyramid-shaped machine that
   the Intelligence intends to use to drain his mind. Just as the Doctor
   is apparently about to have his mind drained, Jamie calls out to the
   servile Yeti to attack Arnold; Jamie, Anne and Professor Travers try to
   drag the Doctor from the machine against his wishes. After Jamie rips
   its wiring out, the pyramid explodes and the Yeti and Arnold fall to
   the floor, lifeless without the influence of the Great Intelligence,
   which has now been dispersed back into space. Everyone is happy except
   for the Doctor. He explains that he had sabotaged the conversion
   headset and would have drained the Intelligence had the device been
   used - but now the Intelligence is free once more. After saying
   goodbye, the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria slip away and head back to the
   TARDIS.
