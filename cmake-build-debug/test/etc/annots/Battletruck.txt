   In the near future, Earth has been devastated by a series of wars
   referred to as "the Oil Wars" over depleting petroleum reserves. The
   regions around the oil producing Mesopotamia Basin are largely
   radioactive wastelands due to limited nuclear exchange; oil fields in
   Saudi Arabia and most of the Middle East burn out of control. Food
   riots have become common in many cities around the world which are now
   under martial law. Much of the American rural countryside has become
   lawless with the majority of remaining military and police trying to
   maintain order in the cities. Large groups of citizens are fleeing
   cities to the countryside to find food and any remaining fuel reserves.
   What little petroleum remains in these regions has become a precious
   commodity fought over by vicious warlords and mercenaries. A war party
   led by former U.S. Army Colonel Jacob Straker (James Wainwright),
   traveling in a large, heavily armed, armored truck, intercept two
   traders riding in a horse-drawn carriage with large amount of diesel
   fuel, killing one of the traders. The surviving trader takes the war
   party to the source, which is a hidden supply depot lost during the
   local government's collapse and thought to be radioactive. Straker
   orders his men to setup camp to use the supply depot as a base of
   operations.

   Straker's daughter Coraline "Corlie" (Annie McEnroe) refuses to execute
   the surviving trader. While Straker plans the camp's defense at night,
   she runs away and flees through the open desert. Corlie is saved from a
   squad of men sent to return her to the camp by Hunter (Michael Beck),
   an ex-soldier armed with a high-tech motorbike. Corlie lies about her
   past and claims she was a hostage taken after her family died. Needing
   further medical attention for a leg injury, Hunter takes Corlie to live
   in the walled city of Clearwater Farm, governed as a strict
   old-fashioned democracy, where she is quickly accepted by the
   community. However, she is soon discovered by her father's men who take
   over the Clearwater community to feed Straker's war party. Corlie
   steals a horse and manages to escape back to Hunter's remote farm in
   the woods.

   The mercenaries terrorize and pillage the community. Straker tortures
   the resident mechanic Rusty (John Ratzenberger) into giving him the
   location of Hunter's secret hideout. Straker moves to attack Hunter's
   farm and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his motorbike
   and Straker, in a rage, plows through Hunter's residence with his
   armored truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and
   asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's
   "battletruck". While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus
   occupied, one of the residents turns traitor and knocks out Corlie,
   puts her in a horse-drawn wagon, and heads out to deliver her back to
   Straker. Hunter tries to stop him, but the traitor sets an ambush for
   him and wounds him with a crossbow. Believing that he has killed
   Hunter, the traitor appears at Straker's headquarters with Corlie in
   the wagon.

   Meanwhile, Hunter regains consciousness and manages to limp back to
   Clearwater on his bike. While getting patched up there, Rusty finishes
   the armored car and shortly Hunter takes off in it, despite the fact
   that he is wounded. He attacks Straker's headquarters, plowing through
   buildings and tents and eventually dropping a grenade into Straker's
   50,000 liter diesel fuel supply, destroying the fuel. He then runs and
   Straker, now in a towering rage, takes off after him. In the process,
   he forces the driver to drive the truck at a higher speed, overheating
   the turbines. This stresses out the driver (who loves the truck) and
   leads to dissension between him and Straker. Hunter, meanwhile, gets
   some distance ahead, jumps out of the car and climbs to a high place
   overlooking the road and it is now revealed that the whole attack on
   Straker's headquarters was a ruse to lure the truck into an ambush. The
   Clearwater people are at a overlooking ridge waiting for Hunter with
   his motorcycle and a 66mm rocket launcher which Hunter had given them
   earlier in the film. Hunter fires a couple of armor-piercing rockets at
   the moving truck, but only one round hits which causes slight damage
   and a small fire, which causes more stress between Straker and the
   truck driver. The driver attempts to kill Straker, who he feels is
   uselessly destroying the truck. Straker kills the driver who slumps
   over the wheel and now the truck, throttle set to full, is more or less
   out of control.

   Back on the motorbike again, Hunter manages to jump onto the moving
   truck through a hole in the top that one of his rockets had made. A
   battle ensues, the truck still careening wildly back and forth while
   Corlie tries to control it with the dead body of the driver slumped
   over the wheel and Straker furiously shouting commands to everyone.
   Eventually, Hunter fights his way to the front, temporarily stuns
   Straker, grabs Corlie, and jumps with her from the back of the
   still-wildly out of control battletruck with Straker still in it and
   still screaming, making death threats, and bumbling about the smoking
   ruins of the interior of the truck before it falls off a cliff, crashes
   and explodes, killing him.

   Hunter and Corlie end up back at Clearwater, where Corlie apparently
   settles for good as part of the community. Ever the loner, Hunter rides
   off into the sunset on a horse, promising Corlie that he will be back
   "sometime".
