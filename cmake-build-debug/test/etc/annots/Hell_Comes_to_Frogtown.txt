   This film is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where few fertile men
   and women exist due to atomic fallout. As a result, the government
   places a high priority on those whom can still breed. Shortly before
   the movie opens, a group of mutant amphibians (who have been exiled to
   the desert by humans) capture a group of fertile women and are using
   them as sex slaves.

   Sam Hell (Piper) is a nomadic traveler who wanders the countryside. He
   is eventually captured by an organization of warrior-nurses, the
   closest thing to a government in his region of the world, who reveal
   that they located him by tracking the trail of pregnant women left in
   his wake. Their original plan was to use him as breeding stock with
   their collection of fertile women, but this was the group captured by
   the mutants. With their own attempts to capture the women failing, the
   group presses Hell into service as a mercenary; he is to infiltrate the
   mutant city (derogatorily referred to as "Frogtown") and rescue the
   women. To make sure that the rebellious Hell follows his orders, he is
   forced to wear an electronic protective codpiece that will explode if
   he disobeys or tries to abort his mission. Having already had numerous
   samples of his reproductive material taken, he is now deemed far more
   expendable than the women themselves. To aid him in his mission (and
   make sure he follows the plan), he is paired with one of the nurses,
   Spangle (Bergman), and an aggressive guard named Centinella (Verrell).

   During their journey to Frogtown, Hell tries numerous times to escape
   but quickly learns that a device Spangle carries will shock his
   genitals if used or if he gets too far away from it. Despite their
   rocky start and Spangle's initial cold demeanor, the pair grow closer
   during the journey and eventually fall in love. When they reach
   Frogtown, everyone involved is captured. The frogs' second-in-command,
   Bull (Nicholas Worth), tortures Hell and attempts to remove the
   codpiece for its technology. Meanwhile, a slightly drugged Spangle is
   forced to work as a slave and dance for the frogs' Commander Toty
   (Brian Frank) in the notable "Dance of the Three Snakes" sequence.
   Proving more successful than she had wished, the nurse soon finds
   herself at the mercy of the aroused commander. However, with the
   codpiece now removed (Bull finally removed it with a chainsaw, but it
   blew up and killed him), the escaped Hell rescues her along with the
   group of fertile women (Ellen Crocker, Kim Hewson, Ilana Ishaki, Annie
   McKinon and Janie Thorson) held captive.
