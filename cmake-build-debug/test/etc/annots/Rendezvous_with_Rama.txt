   After an asteroid falls in Northeast Italy in 2077, creating a major
   disaster, the government of Earth sets up the Spaceguard system as an
   early warning of arrivals from deep space.

   The "Rama" of the title is an alien starship, initially mistaken for an
   asteroid categorised as "31/439". It is detected by astronomers in the
   year 2131 while it is still outside the orbit of Jupiter. Its speed
   (100,000 km/h - 62,137 m/h) and the angle of its trajectory clearly
   indicate it is not on a long orbit around the sun, but is an
   interstellar object. The astronomers' interest is further piqued when
   they realise the asteroid has an extremely rapid rotation period of
   four minutes and is exceptionally large. It is named Rama after the
   Hindu god,^[6] and an unmanned space probe dubbed Sita is launched from
   the Mars moon Phobos to intercept and photograph it. The resulting
   images reveal that Rama is a perfect cylinder, 20 kilometres (12 mi) in
   diameter and 50 kilometres (31 mi) long, and almost completely
   featureless, making this humankind's first encounter with an alien
   spacecraft.

   The solar survey vessel Endeavour is sent to study Rama, as it is the
   only ship close enough to do so in the brief period Rama will spend in
   the solar system. Endeavour manages to rendezvous with Rama one month
   after it first comes to Earth's attention, when the alien ship is
   already inside Venus's orbit. The crew, led by Commander Bill Norton,
   enters Rama through a safety system consisting of triple airlocks, and
   explores the 16-km wide by 50-km long cylindrical world of its
   interior, but the nature and purpose of the starship and its creators
   remain enigmatic throughout the book. Rama's inner surfaces hold
   "cities" of geometric structures that resemble buildings and are
   separated by streets with shallow trenches. A band of water, dubbed the
   Cylindrical Sea, stretches around Rama's central circumference. Massive
   spires, which are theorised as part of Rama's propulsion system, stand
   at its "southern" end. They also find that Rama's atmosphere is
   breathable.

   One of the crew members, Jimmy Pak, who has experience with low gravity
   skybikes, rides a smuggled skybike along Rama's axis to the far end,
   otherwise inaccessible due to the cylindrical sea and the 500m high
   cliff on the opposite shore. Once at the massive metal cones on the
   southern end of Rama, Jimmy detects magnetic and electric fields coming
   from the cones, which increase, resulting in lightning. Due to his
   proximity to the spires, the concussion from a discharge damages his
   skybike causing him to crash on the isolated southern continent.

   When Pak wakes up, he sees a crab-like creature picking up his skybike
   and chopping it into pieces. He cannot decide whether it is a robot or
   a biological alien, and keeps his distance while radioing for help. As
   Pak waits, Norton sends a rescue party across the cylindrical sea,
   using a small, improvised craft, constructed earlier for exploration of
   the sea's central island. The creature dumps the remains of the skybike
   into a pit, but ignores Pak himself, who explores the surrounding
   fields while waiting for the rescue party to arrive. Amongst the
   strange geometric structures, he sees an alien flower growing through a
   cracked tile in the otherwise sterile environment, and decides to take
   it as both a curiosity and for scientific research.

   Pak jumps off the 500m cliff, his descent slowed by the low gravity and
   using his shirt as a drogue parachute, and is quickly rescued by the
   waiting boat. As they ride back, tidal waves form in the cylindrical
   sea, created by the movements of Rama itself as it makes course
   corrections. When the crew arrives at base, they see a variety of odd
   creatures inspecting their camp. When one is found damaged and
   apparently lifeless, the team's doctor/biologist Surgeon-Commander
   Laura Ernst inspects it, and discovers it to be a hybrid biological
   entity and robot--eventually termed a "biot". It, and by assumption the
   others, are powered by internal batteries (much like those of
   terrestrial electric eels) and possess some intelligence. They are
   believed to be the drones of Rama's still-absent builders.

   The members of the Rama Committee and the United Planets, both based on
   the Moon, have been monitoring events inside Rama and giving feedback.
   The Hermian colonists have concluded that Rama is a potential threat
   and send a rocket-mounted nuclear bomb to destroy it should it prove to
   pose a threat. Lt. Boris Rodrigo takes advantage of the five minute
   transmission delay and uses a pair of wire cutters to defuse the bomb
   and its control.

   As Rama approaches perihelion, and on their final expedition, the crew
   decide to visit the city closest to their point of entry, christened
   "London", and use a laser to cut open one of the "buildings" to see
   what it houses. They discover transparent pedestals containing
   holograms of various artefacts, which they theorise are used by the
   Ramans as templates for creating tools and other objects. One hologram
   appears to be a uniform with bandoliers, straps and pockets that
   suggests the size and shape of the Ramans. As the crew photographs some
   of the holograms, the biots begin returning to the cylindrical sea,
   where they are recycled by aquatic biots ('sharks') and the six
   striplights that illuminate Rama's interior start to dim, prompting the
   explorers to leave Rama and to re-board Endeavour.

   With Endeavour a safe distance away, Rama reaches perihelion and
   utilizes the Sun's gravitational field, and its mysterious "space
   drive", to perform a slingshot manoeuvre which flings it out of the
   solar system and towards an unknown destination in the direction of the
   Large Magellanic Cloud.
