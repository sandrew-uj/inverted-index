   In the near future, war rages across the Republic of Gilead (formerly
   the United States of America) and pollution has rendered 99% of the
   population sterile. Kate is a woman who attempts to emigrate to Canada
   with her husband Luke and daughter Jill. As they take a dirt road, the
   Gilead Border Guard orders them to turn back or they will open fire.
   Luke uses an automatic rifle to draw the fire, telling Kate to run, but
   he is shot. Kate is captured, while Jill wanders off into the back
   country, confused and unaccompanied. The authorities take Kate to a
   training facility with several other women, where the women are trained
   to become Handmaids, who are concubines for the privileged but barren
   couples who run the country's religious fundamentalist regime. Although
   she resists indoctrination into the cult of the Handmaids, which mixes
   Old Testament orthodoxy with scripted group chanting and ritualized
   violence, Kate is soon assigned to the home of "the Commander" (Fred)
   and his cold, inflexible wife, Serena Joy. There she is named "Offred"
   ("of Fred").

   Her role as the Commander's latest concubine is emotionless, as she
   lies between Serena Joy's legs while the Commander rapes her, both of
   them hoping that she will bear them a child. Kate continually longs for
   her earlier life, but nightmares of her husband's death and her
   daughter's disappearance haunt her. A doctor explains that many of
   Gilead's male leaders are as sterile as their wives. Desperately
   wanting a baby, Serena Joy persuades Kate to risk the punishment for
   fornication (death by hanging) in order to be fertilized by another man
   who may impregnate her and consequently spare her life. When Kate
   agrees to this, Serena Joy informs Kate that her daughter Jill is
   alive, and provides a recent photograph of her living in another
   Commander's household, but tells Kate she can never see her daughter.
   The Commander also tries to get closer to Kate, sensing that if she
   enjoyed herself more she would become a better handmaid. Exploiting
   Kate's background as a librarian, he gets her hard-to-obtain items and
   allows her into his private library. However, during a night out, the
   Commander has sex with Kate in an unauthorized manner. The other man
   selected by Serena Joy turns out to be Nick, the Commander's
   sympathetic chauffeur. Kate grows attached to Nick and eventually
   becomes pregnant with his child.

   Kate ultimately kills the Commander, and a police unit then arrives to
   take her away. Believing the policemen are members of the Eyes, the
   government's secret police, she realizes that they are soldiers from
   the resistance movement (Mayday), of which Nick is also a part. Kate
   then flees with them, parting from Nick in an emotional scene.

   Now free once again and wearing non-uniform clothes, but facing an
   uncertain future, a pregnant Kate is living by herself in a trailer
   while receiving intelligence reports from the rebels. Wondering if and
   hoping that she and Nick will be reunited, she resolves with the
   rebels' help to find her daughter.
