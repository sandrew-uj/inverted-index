   Set in 1968 New York City in an alternate universe to the Dryco
   universe of the previous five iterations of the series, Going,
   Going, Gone nevertheless disposes of several of the series' characters
   in its closing chapters. Its protagonist is Walter Bullitt, an
   egocentric expert in psychoactive substances who freelances for various
   branches of the increasingly Nazi-influenced United States government
   spy apparatus. Though he passes for white, Bullitt is in fact of
   African-American descent in an USA where, as revealed in previous
   novels in the Dryco series, the American Civil War never took place. As
   a result, racial relations in this version of the USA have been much
   more fraught, with almost all full-blooded African Americans interned
   and used as slave labor during World War II before being disposed of,
   and by 1968 even black music has been culturally marginalized.
   Walter becomes subject to increasingly strange experiences, hearing
   voices and seeing ghosts from a parallel New York almost a century more
   advanced than his. Walter is taken to this alternative New York
   (the primary locale of the previous five Dryco novels) which, after
   flooding due to the Greenhouse effect, has been moved north, is
   populated by all races and features in its collection of futuristic
   wonders television, which never caught on in his world. The novel
   ends with the two epistemic worlds converging into a New York which is,
   in the words of critic Paul Dukes a "morally better place than either
   of the two which composed it".
