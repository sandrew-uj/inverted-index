   In 2013, an unnamed nomad enters the Utah flatlands, trading
   Shakespearean performances for food and water. In one of the towns, the
   nomad is forced into the ranks of the Holnists, the predominant
   neo-fascist militia in the area and branded on his shoulder with their
   symbol, a figure 8. Their leader, General Bethlehem, schemes to take
   over the fallen United States with his regime. When the nomad escapes,
   he takes refuge in a long-deceased postman's mail vehicle.

   With the postman's uniform and mail bag, he arrives in Pineview
   claiming to be from the newly restored US government. He convinces town
   sheriff Briscoe by showing a letter addressed to elderly villager Irene
   March. The Postman inspires a teenager named Ford Lincoln Mercury and
   swears him into the postal service. The Postman also meets spouses Abby
   and Michael, fulfilling their clinical request to impregnate her. When
   the Postman leaves for the town of Benning, he carries a pile of mail
   left at the post office door by the townspeople.

   During a raid of Pineview, General Bethlehem learns of the Postman's
   tales of a restored government and becomes afraid of losing power if
   word spreads. He burns the American flag and post office, kills
   Michael, kidnaps Abby, and next attacks the town of Benning. The
   Postman surrenders, but Abby saves him from execution, and the two
   escape into the surrounding mountains. A pregnant Abby and an injured
   Postman ride out the winter in an abandoned cabin.

   When spring arrives, they cross the range and run into a girl, who
   claims to be a postal carrier. She reveals that Ford Lincoln Mercury
   organized a postal service based on the Postman's story. They have
   established communications with other settlements, creating a
   quasi-society and inadvertently spreading hope.

   Bethlehem is still fighting to suppress the postal carriers, who are
   mostly teenagers pitted against a better-equipped enemy. In the face of
   mounting casualties, the Postman orders everyone to disband and writes
   a surrender letter to Bethlehem. However, Bethlehem learns to his
   dismay that the Postman's example has spread farther than he could have
   anticipated when his men capture a carrier from California, and he
   redoubles his efforts to find the Postman. The Postman and Abby,
   closely followed by young carriers Eddie, Ponytail and Billy, travel to
   Bridge City. When Bethlehem's scouts catch up, the mayor helps the
   Postman to escape on a cable car to find volunteers for an army of
   carriers. Before leaving, he and Abby reciprocate their feelings and
   fall in love.

   In a recitation of King Henry V's speech prior to the Siege of
   Harfleur, the Postman rallies himself and his troops to war. The
   mounted Carriers and Holnists meet across a field. Knowing the
   casualties will be great if the armies meet in battle, the Postman
   instead challenges Bethlehem for leadership, with their troops as
   witnesses. The Postman wins the fight but spares Bethlehem's life to
   maintain morale. Bethlehem lunges to shoot the Postman but is shot by
   Colonel Getty, Bethlehem`s executive officer. Getty then surrenders,
   and the rest of the Holnists follow his lead.

   Thirty years later, the Postman's grown daughter, accompanied by other
   public figures and servicemen (including postal workers), speaks at a
   ceremony unveiling a bronze statue by territorial waters in St. Rose,
   Oregon in tribute to her father, who has recently died (1973-2043). Her
   speech, along with modern clothing and technology, reveal that the
   Postman and his mail carriers' actions have helped rebuild the United
   States.
