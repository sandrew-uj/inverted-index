   Abomination takes place in 1999 after the United States has been almost
   wiped out by a deadly plague. According to the game's manual, the
   disease started on the east coast, and communication with the west
   coast ceased within 72 hours. The last few groups of survivors stopped
   broadcasting after six days, and the overwhelming majority of the
   country's population has been wiped out.

   Most of the remaining survivors have pledged allegiance to an
   apocalyptic and ultra-violent cult known as "The Faithful", a hazily
   defined religion whose followers practice mortification of the flesh,
   as well as vivisecting themselves and others to prove the strength of
   their beliefs. The Faithful are eventually revealed to be at least
   several hundred years old, possibly originating from Tibet. The cult
   predicts the coming of "The Brood" and "the Elder Gods" in a
   Lovecraftian fashion. The game's backstory also mentions that The
   Faithful are somehow connected with a strange and very old statuette,
   called "The Princess of Death", which resembles a cross between a Black
   Madonna and a prehistoric depiction of the mother goddess. Shortly
   before the plague first broke out, the US government suspected that the
   Faithful had either stolen the statue from the unspecified museum where
   it was kept, or that through their rituals, they caused it to explode
   there, perhaps disseminating one or more biological agents hidden
   inside. The game's opening cutscene contains no words but suggests that
   the statuette may have been part of a meteorite which struck the earth
   long ago. The cutscene also shows the Oval Office with a figure
   resembling President Bill Clinton, who has obviously collapsed and died
   while still at his desk--within moments after he signed and issued the
   written orders for the emergency response plan "Project Nemesis", which
   can be seen in a folder there.

   The game takes place in a large, unnamed coastal city, which remains
   mostly undamaged but plagued by odd biological matter, ranging from
   tentacles growing out of the sidewalk to huge, three-story towers of
   tissue. The player controls members of "The Nemesis Project", who
   according to the backstory were originally mustered at a secret base in
   a fictional location called "Kinmore Field" in Ohio. These
   supersoldiers are black operatives who have been enhanced through the
   use of surgical procedures and experimental nanotechnology, as part of
   a last-ditch effort to find a way to eliminate The Faithful and put an
   end to the plague. This is why the characters have pseudoscientific
   special abilities and, presumably, immune systems capable of protecting
   them from the plague. The cutscene shows the soldiers being revived by
   a failsafe mechanism that automatically brings them out from cryogenic
   suspension. Surviving military or police personnel are also recruited
   into the player's roster, and they have no superpowers, but do possess
   specialized weapons training.
