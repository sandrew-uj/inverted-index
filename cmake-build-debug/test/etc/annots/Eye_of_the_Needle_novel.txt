   In 1940, Henry Faber, a German spy nicknamed 'die Nadel' ('The Needle')
   due to his trademark weapon being a stiletto, is working at a London
   railway depot, collecting information on troop movements. Faber is
   halfway through radioing this information to Berlin when his widowed
   landlady stumbles into his room hoping for intimacy. Faber fears that
   Mrs. Garden will eventually realise that he was using a transmitter and
   that he is a spy, so he kills her with his stiletto, then resumes his
   transmission.

   David, a trainee RAF pilot, and his bride Lucy are on their honeymoon
   when they're involved in a car crash. David loses the use of both his
   legs. Unable to fly during the Battle of Britain, David grows
   embittered and he and Lucy retire to the isolated Storm Island
   (fictitious) off the east coast of Scotland.

   Meanwhile, British Intelligence has executed or recruited all German
   spies except Faber. A widowed history professor, Godliman, and an
   ex-policeman, Bloggs, are employed by MI5 to catch him. They start with
   the interrupted broadcast and his codename Die Nadel. They connect the
   landlady's murder to Faber by him having used his 'needle' during the
   transmission. They then interview Faber's fellow tenants from 1940. One
   identifies Faber from a photo of him as a young army officer.

   Faber is told by Berlin to investigate the First United States Army
   Group (FUSAG) military base. He takes photos and discovers it is a
   dummy and has merely been constructed to look real from the air.
   Several soldiers try to arrest him but he kills them with his stiletto.
   Realising that FUSAG being fake implies that the D-Day landings will be
   in Normandy rather than around Calais, Faber heads for Aberdeen,
   Scotland, where a U-boat will take him and his photos back to Germany.

   Godliman and Bloggs realise what Faber is trying to achieve and chase
   him across Northern England and Scotland. Faber escapes many times but
   his repeated killings allow MI5 to track him to Aberdeen. Both Hitler
   and Churchill are informed that Faber has the critical information.

   In Aberdeen, Faber steals a small trawler and sets out to meet the
   U-boat. Caught by a fierce storm, he is shipwrecked on Storm Island,
   collapsing near the isolated house where David and Lucy live. Lucy
   nurses him back to health. Stuck in a loveless marriage to the crippled
   David, she begins a physical relationship with Faber. David soon
   discovers both Lucy's infidelity and Faber's FUSAG photos. David
   confronts Faber, but after a struggle Faber kills David by rolling him
   off a cliff, and tells Lucy it was another accident. However, she
   discovers her husband's body and realises the truth.

   Faber realises he may be caught before leaving the island and so tries
   to radio the information about FUSAG directly to Germany. Lucy stops
   him by short-circuiting the electricity in the cottage. By the logic
   which had guided his actions throughout his career, Faber should have
   killed Lucy - but he finds himself unable to do so, being deeply in
   love with her to the detriment of his mission and of simple
   self-preservation. Unable to send a radio message, Faber attempts to
   descend the cliff and swim to the waiting U-boat. Lucy throws a rock
   down at him, striking him and causing him to lose his balance and fall
   to his death. An RAF patrol plane then appears and drives the U-boat
   away. A fictitious radio message is sent with Faber's call code,
   convincing the Germans that the invasion is targeting Calais. Bloggs
   comforts the widowed Lucy.
