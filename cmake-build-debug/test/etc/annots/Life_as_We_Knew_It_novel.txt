   The book portrays 16-year-old Miranda, living a normal life in
   Pennsylvania with her mother and brothers. Her biggest worries are her
   grades and her conflicted feelings about becoming a godmother to her
   soon-to-be-born half-sibling, who is expected by her father and his
   second wife Lisa. Soon, the news becomes focused on one subject: an
   asteroid predicted to hit the moon. People are excited about the
   opportunity to witness the event, and on the night of the impact,
   Miranda and her family go outside to witness it. However, the asteroid
   was denser than expected by scientists, and immediately after impact,
   it becomes apparent that something is wrong. The moon has been pushed
   closer to the Earth by the impact, which causes a change in the Earth's
   gravitational pull.

   Life on earth is shattered, as is Miranda's life. Tsunamis and
   earthquakes ravage the coasts of many countries, causing millions of
   deaths. Chaos erupts and Miranda and her family go shopping for food,
   water, and supplies before the stores are emptied. Miranda's older
   brother Matt comes home from college. Living inland, they are safe from
   tsunamis, but as the summer goes on, another threat looms; the moon's
   shift causes magma to be forced up to the surface, resulting in many
   dormant volcanoes erupting, which cover the sky in ash, causing the
   temperature to drop dramatically (enough for frost to appear by
   mid-August and for 20-degree weather by October), making it impossible
   for humans to grow. As things become harsher for the family, they start
   eating less to conserve food. Laura stops eating and makes other
   sacrifices to give Jon, who Miranda is convinced Laura considers to be
   the strongest of her children, a chance of survival. This is often a
   source of resentment that causes conflict between Miranda and her
   mother.

   Winter is an especially hard time. With little food, the family must
   also deal with snow, a lack of running water, and no natural gas or
   electricity. A serious influenza infection spreads through town,
   killing hundreds of people, including Peter; Miranda is spared, and
   nurses her mother and brothers back to health. As the family become
   more and more isolated, with nearly everyone else is either leaving
   town or dying, they continue to fight for survival. As the family's
   food supply comes very close to running out, Miranda ventures into
   town. She tells herself that it is to see whether there has been a
   letter from her father and Lisa, though in her heart she knows that she
   is dying of starvation and her intention is to die away from her home,
   where her mother will not have to see it. When Miranda finds the post
   office abandoned, and as she is about to lie down and let the cold kill
   her, she sees a yellow piece of paper that attracts her gaze. The paper
   leads her to the town hall, where, to her shock, she discovers the
   mayor is giving out bags of food; there are few takers, as many people
   are dead and even more have no way of knowing about the program. The
   family is given four bags of food and promised more to come in the
   following weeks. With a new reason to hope, Miranda muses on her
   seventeenth birthday about why she is still keeping a diary: for the
   people who might read it in the future, or for herself.
