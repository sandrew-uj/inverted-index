   During his forced residence at a deep underground offensive-warfare
   complex, X-127 is ordered to push missile firing buttons to begin World
   War III (which lasts a total of 2 hours and 58 minutes). From that
   point, humanity's few civilian survivors are situated within a
   collection of underground shelter complexes on Levels 1 through 5 at
   various depths from the irradiated surface, while military personnel
   already occupy the deepest and safest Levels 6 and 7. It later emerges
   that the orders given have been wholly automatic due to a launch on
   warning strategy; the war has taken place as a series of automated
   electronic responses to an initial accident.

   X-127 and his fellow shelter inhabitants belatedly learn the criteria
   that had determined admission to the shelters: civilians were granted
   only an illusion of protection, while government officials and military
   personnel were granted significantly more security. Those who were
   assigned to launch the nuclear missiles, and their support staff, were
   selected for their ability to behave like machines, yet are counted
   upon to preserve the human spirit and rebuild the human race. X-127 and
   his colleagues attempt to carry on human life, but discover that
   institutions such as marriage and preparations for child-rearing have
   been hollowed out by conditions and attitudes in the antiseptic
   underground.

   Toward the end of the novel, the inhabitants of surviving shelters
   within collaterally hit neutral nations, the former enemy nation and
   the unnamed protagonist nation gradually meet their deaths as
   radioactive surface contamination makes its way down past air filters
   and into water sources in the ground. As Level 7's safety falls into
   question, its inhabitants confront their growing isolation,
   overconfidence in technology, loneliness below a dead world, and the
   insanity of a society whose momentum toward annihilation exceeded its
   collective will to live. At last, the inhabitants of "Level 7" are
   wiped out after a malfunction in their nuclear power pile results in
   lethal contamination of their erstwhile sanctuary. They are apparently
   the last human beings on Earth to perish, and X-127 is the very last
   one at the story's conclusion. The extinction of humanity has taken
   four months from the time that the missiles were first fired.
