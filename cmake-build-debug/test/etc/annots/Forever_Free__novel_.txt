   William Mandella, protagonist of The Forever War, lives with his wife
   Marygay on the icy world Middle Finger, a planet of the Mizar system.
   Dissatisfied with the state of their society, they eventually decide to
   jump forward in time, using the time dilation of interstellar travel.
   Their intention is to travel for 10 subjective years, at relativistic
   speeds, into the future, during which 40,000 Earth years will have
   passed on Middle Finger. They, along with other Forever War veterans
   and other disenchanted humans on Middle Finger, hope that whatever they
   will find upon their return will be more to their liking. This requires
   the consent of the posthuman group mind now known as 'Man', and of the
   alien group mind Tauran race. When permission is denied, William and
   allies hijack the ship.

   After Marygay and William head away from their planet, a series of
   unexplained occurrences happen and the ship starts to lose antimatter
   mysteriously. They abandon the ship and return home. Instead of the
   intended 40,000 years, they have only been away 24 Earth years. Upon
   arrival, they find the planet still intact, but seemingly vacant;
   everyone having literally disappeared at the same time as the incident
   on their ship. They then return to Earth and in the course of the
   investigation they discover a shape-shifting being posing as an android
   cowboy at a western-themed amusement park. This being has been on Earth
   and the other inhabited planets for millennia and is not certain of its
   own origin. It also has no idea what happened to the denizens of Earth.

   The resolution involves a god who evidently created the universe as an
   experiment. This god explains that the action of leaving the galaxy on
   a 40,000 year round-trip is similar to a laboratory mouse escaping its
   cage. Eventually "God" restores the inhabitants, who have been stored
   in stasis.^[1]
