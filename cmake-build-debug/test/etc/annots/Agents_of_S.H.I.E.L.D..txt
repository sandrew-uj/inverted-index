   The first season follows S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson as he puts
   together a small team of agents to handle strange new cases. They
   investigate Project Centipede and its leader, "The Clairvoyant",
   eventually uncovering that the organization is backed by the terrorist
   group Hydra, which has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. In the second season,
   following the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. in Captain America: The
   Winter Soldier, Coulson becomes director of the organization and is
   tasked with rebuilding it while dealing with Hydra, a faction of
   anti-superhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and a newly revealed superhuman
   race called the Inhumans.

   During the third season, Coulson begins a secret mission to assemble
   the Secret Warriors, a team of Inhumans, as Hydra restores its
   ancient Inhuman leader Hive to power. After the defeat of Hive and
   Hydra, S.H.I.E.L.D. is made a legitimate organization once again with
   the signing of the Sokovia Accords. In the fourth season, Coulson
   returns to being a field agent so S.H.I.E.L.D. can have a public
   leader, and is tasked with tracking down more enhanced people,
   including Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider. In addition, Agent Leo Fitz and
   Holden Radcliffe complete their work on the Life Model Decoy and
   Framework virtual reality projects.

   The fifth season sees Coulson and members of his team abducted to the
   space station Lighthouse in the year 2091, where they must try to save
   the remnants of humanity while figuring out how to get home. After
   returning to the present, where they are labeled fugitives, Coulson and
   his team work to prevent the future that they saw. They succeed in
   defeating a Gravitonium-powered Glenn Talbot, but Coulson dies due to
   his interactions with Ghost Rider in the previous season.

   As the sixth season begins, the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents divide into two
   groups: one heads to space to find Fitz, who is lost following the last
   season's time-traveling, while the other remains on Earth to
   face a team of mercenaries led by Sarge, a man that looks just like
   Coulson. Season seven finds the team, including a Life
   Model Decoy of Coulson, jumping throughout time to prevent the
   Chronicoms from establishing Earth as their new home, Chronyca-3, and
   eradicating S.H.I.E.L.D. from history.
