   The book follows an unnamed young socialite living in New York as she
   interacts with her best friend Julie and tries to find a successful
   romantic relationship. Initially she believes that she's found "The
   One" in the photographer Zack and the two become engaged, after which
   point Zack becomes emotionally abusive and unresponsive. Despite her
   best attempts to salvage the relationship, the protagonist is dumped by
   Zack. Not only does this harm her social standing, but the protagonist
   is psychologically devastated by the end of the relationship and
   becomes anorexic as a result. Things are not made much better by her
   mother's insistence that she return home to England (her family
   emigrated there during the narrator's childhood) and strike up a
   relationship with a local Earl that they haven't seen since a
   disastrous business transaction with her father years ago.

   The protagonist goes through several terrible relationships with
   married men (she was told that they were single or separated) and finds
   herself drawn to and irritated by the filmmaker Charlie, who has
   started dating her friend Julie. The two eventually end up running into
   each other at a hotel one night after the protagonist's apartment is
   robbed. Despite some friction between the two, the protagonist finds
   that she genuinely likes Charlie, who tells her that he's broken up
   with Julie. The two end up having sex, something that weighs upon the
   protagonist's conscience since she has a rule against sleeping with a
   friend's ex-boyfriend. The following day Julie ends up finding out
   about the sexual encounter after questioning the protagonist about the
   night's events, upon which point she reveals that she and Charlie never
   broke up and tells the protagonist that she never wants to see her
   again. Since the friendship is gone, the protagonist decides to see
   Charlie again that night, as he had invited her to return for dinner.
   However the protagonist finds that Charlie has left, giving her the
   impression that he was just using her like the other men she has dated.

   She ends up deciding to return to England, only for her car to break
   down partway to her parents' house. The protagonist manages to make it
   to the home owned by the Earl, where she runs into Charlie, who tells
   her that he is the Earl her mother wanted her to meet and that he had
   left the United States due to news of his father's death. At this point
   her mother arrives under the guise of taking the protagonist home, with
   the intention of making her way back into Charlie's mother's good
   graces. This all proves to be too much for the protagonist and before
   leaving, she tells Charlie that she hates him and that she can no
   longer trust him since he never trusted her with any of this
   information. After returning home the protagonist ends up talking with
   Julie (who has traveled to England), who confesses that she and Charlie
   had broken up when he'd said they had but that she'd covered up the
   information since traditionally Julie was always the one to end a
   relationship. This causes the protagonist to realize that Charlie had
   never intended to be dishonest and she eventually meets up with him at
   his home, where they reconcile and officially become a couple.
