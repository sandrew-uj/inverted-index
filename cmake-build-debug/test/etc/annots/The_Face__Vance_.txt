   Kirth Gersen tracks Lens Larque across several worlds, most notably
   Aloysius, the desert world Dar Sai and the more temperate Methel. He
   eventually learns that Larque is a Darsh, born Husse Bugold. He had
   been deprived of an earlobe and made a rachepol or outcast from his
   clan for a crime considered "repulsive but not superlatively heinous."
   He took the name Lens Larque, after the lanslarke, an indigenous
   creature and the fetish of the Bugold clan. (It was this slim clue that
   enabled Gersen to track him down.) He then became a notorious criminal
   renowned for his magnificent, if often grotesque and horrifying, jests.

   Gersen encounters Larque at a Darsh restaurant on Aloysius, but only
   manages to cut off his remaining earlobe. Gersen had arranged to
   impound one of Larque's spaceships, in order to lure him in from the
   lawless Beyond. In an ironic twist, Larque escapes Gersen's courtroom
   ambush, blows up the ship, and collects insurance money - from a
   company owned by Gersen.

   Gersen then proceeds to Dar Sai. The harsh planet is home to the
   "fierce and perverse" Darsh, who mine black sand, stable transuranic
   elements of atomic number 120 or greater. The inhabitants have odd
   mating customs; when the moon is full, men and women chase each other
   on the desert. Young women are used as bait to lure men into the
   clutches of ugly, older women.

   Gersen determines that Larque is connected somehow with a seemingly
   worthless Dar Sai company called Kotzash Mutual. He begins buying up
   its shares in an attempt to gain control, but falls short of what he
   needs, until shares are put up as a prize for a hadaul match. Hadaul is
   essentially a free-for-all brawl within a series of concentric rings.
   Gersen, by dint of skill and cleverness, wins the match and gains
   control of the company. He also rescues Jerdian Chanseth, a young
   aristocratic Methlen woman, when her sightseeing party is waylaid by
   Darsh during their mating activities. A brief romance blossoms between
   them.

   Gersen then follows Larque to Methel. The wealthier Methlens reside in
   large manors with which they closely identify. Gersen attempts to renew
   his relationship with Jerdian, going so far as to buy the mansion next
   to her family's. But being a disreputable (if extremely rich) space
   vagabond and decidedly not Methlen, he is rejected as a suitor by her
   father, bank owner Adario Chanseth, who uses the law to nullify the
   sale of the house. It turns out that Larque himself had tried to buy
   the same estate, but had also been thwarted by the same Methlen law,
   because Chanseth didn't want to see his "great Darsh face hanging over
   my garden wall."

   Eventually, Gersen learns that Lens Larque and Kotzash Mutual have been
   mining Shanitra, the small moon of Methlen, for some mysterious reason.
   It was well known that Shanitra bore no useful deposits of ore and was
   practically worthless. Nonetheless, Kotzash had gone to great pains to
   place extensive explosive charges all across its surface.

   Gersen finally tracks Larque down and kills him with cluthe, a
   paralyzing poison. In his final moments of life, the Darsh begs Gersen
   to press a button, but Gersen denies him his last request. However,
   Gersen has divined Larque's last and most grandiose jest, and having
   exactly the same motivation, he presses the button after the Demon
   Prince has died. Shanitra is racked by explosions and takes on a new
   shape, the face of Lens Larque, expression frozen in a leering grin.
   Gersen then calls Adario Chanseth and dryly informs him there is a
   "great Darsh face hanging over your garden wall."
