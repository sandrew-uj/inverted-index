   Set in the then-future of 1996, Day of the Cheetah details the story of
   US Air Force pilot Kenneth Francis James, who is actually a Soviet KGB
   deep-cover agent assigned to the US High-Technology Aerospace Weapons
   Center (HAWC) at Groom Lake. His job at the secret base involves
   testing the highly advanced XF-34 Dreamstar, which is equipped with a
   thought-control interface.

   James hijacks the fighter, causing Patrick McLanahan and the rest of
   the HAWC crew to try to recover or destroy the plane before it reaches
   the USSR. The Cheetah mentioned in the novel is the XF-15F Cheetah,
   which is an experimental service version of the real-life F-15 S/MTD,
   often used as the Dreamstar's chase plane. The Dreamstar is recovered
   after a number of aerial dogfights over Arizona, the Caribbean, and
   Costa Rica, but the fallout generated by the incident forces the
   closure of HAWC.
