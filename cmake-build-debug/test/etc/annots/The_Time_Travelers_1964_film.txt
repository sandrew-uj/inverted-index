   Scientists Dr. Erik von Steiner (Preston Foster), Dr. Steve Connors
   (Philip Carey), and Carol White (Merry Anders) are testing their
   time-viewing device, drawing enormous amounts of power. Danny McKee
   (Steve Franken), a technician from the power plant, has been sent to
   tell them to shut down their experiment. During the test, odd shadows
   quickly cross the room before the screen shows a stark, barren
   landscape. Danny discovers the screen has become a portal and steps
   through.

   As the setting is becoming unstable, the others enter the portal to
   bring him back. The portal disappears, stranding them. Then they are
   pursued by hostile primitives, ending up in a cave, where they find an
   underground city - all that is left of civilization in a future
   devastated by nuclear war.

   The year is 2071 AD. City leader Dr. Varno (John Hoyt) explains that
   Earth is unable to support life. The residents are frantically working
   on a spacecraft that will take them to a planet orbiting Alpha
   Centauri. The four time travelers, told they may not join that space
   voyage, are allowed to work on recreating their time portal to return
   to their time. Before the colony residents can lift off, the degenerate
   mutant humans break in and destroy the ship and encroach on the city.

   Dr. Varno determines that now the only hope is the time portal, so he
   commits the city's remaining resources to help von Steiner, Connors,
   White, and McKee rebuild the time portal with future technology. As
   they feverishly work, the mutants are invading the colony; along with a
   few people from the future, the four travelers escape back to the
   present just ahead of the mutants. One person throws an object back
   through the portal that damages the equipment on the other side and
   shuts down the portal.

   The survivors return to the lab, where they make a strange discovery.
   Their past selves are still in the lab, yet to pass through the portal,
   but they appear frozen. Through some error, the travelers are
   experiencing time at an accelerated rate; the rest of the world,
   including their past selves, is moving in extremely slow motion. Their
   only option is to travel to the date the portal had briefly been set to
   before being set to 2071 AD, a date over 100,000 years in the future,
   but the screen is dark and what lies ahead is unknown. They quickly
   cross the room, casting their shadows.

   When the last one goes through, the screen flashes on briefly and shows
   the travelers walking in a clearing with trees and grass with the
   surface of the Earth habitable again and people able to build a future
   there. The film then shows their past selves moving at normal speed
   again, repeating the actions seen at the beginning of the film. The
   sequence of events of the entire movie is rapidly reshown, and repeats
   with ever briefer and fewer clips, leaving the viewer in a loop until
   it abruptly ends without further explanation.
