   The novel is told in second-person narrative but primarily from three
   points of view: Edinburgh police Inspector Kavanaugh, who investigates
   spammers murdered in gruesome and inventive ways, and learns about
   similar cases in other parts of Europe; Anwar, a former identity thief
   who becomes Scottish honorary consul for a fictional state in central
   Asia; and "The Toymaker", an enforcer and organizer for the criminal
   "Operation". Their interactions and conflicts drive the story.
