   Nepenthe is a sixteen-year-old orphan who was found and raised by the
   Royal Librarians of Raine. During the new queen's coronation, visitors
   and ambassadors from the Twelve Crowns (domains) that comprise Raine
   gauge Queen Tessera's strength. Bourne of Seale, a junior mage from the
   Floating School, meets Nepenthe in the library with a book inscribed
   with an unknown language, which seems to be written in configurations
   of plant thorns. Instead of delivering it to the Master Librarians,
   Nepenthe decides to transcribe it herself; she soon becomes obsessed
   with learning the book's outcome. On the surface, it appears to be an
   epic poem documenting the conquests of Axis and Kane, an emperor and
   "the Hooded One", three thousand years earlier.

   As Nepenthe continues reading, the ruler of Seale prepares to usurp the
   throne from Tessera, whom he views as weak. (She is only fourteen years
   old.) Reading further as Seale's army marches (and Bourne is imprisoned
   for treason), Nepenthe learns that Axis and Kane traveled through time
   to expand the reach and strength of Axis' empire. Popular histories in
   Raine list the man Kane as Axis' court mage; Kane was, but the woman
   Kane was also his lover who opened the Gates of Time for him. Kane
   became pregnant with his child, and she traveled with the infant
   through time to a cliff side near Raine. She wrote a book about her
   life in the language of thorns and because of her enchantments, no one
   but her daughter could read it--by the book's climax, she has. The
   final words of the book open the Gates of Time that admit Axis and
   Kane, Nepenthe's parents, and their uncountable legions of followers
   near Raine, three thousand years in their future.

   When Queen Tessera learns of the planned invasion, with the help of
   Vevay, her own mage, and the magicians of the Floating School, she uses
   magic to make Raine seem a dilapidated ruin and thereby protect it from
   Axis. Nepenthe meets her mother and refuses Kane's offer to rule Raine,
   because it would require Nepenthe to turn her back on the only world
   she's ever known. Kane chooses to remain in Raine, where she can be
   with her daughter and won't have to hide her identity. This effectively
   stops Axis' conquests because without her; he can't travel through the
   Gates of Time. The forces of Seale see Axis's army retreat in fear,
   which strengthens Tessera's claim on the throne. Kane stays with her
   daughter, and Nepenthe remains in the Royal Library, the only life she
   ever wants to know.
