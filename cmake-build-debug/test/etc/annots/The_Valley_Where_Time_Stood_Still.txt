   Mars, a world with a culture ages older than that of Earth, is a dying
   world, and has been in decline for eons. By the twenty-second century
   it has become a colony of the younger civilization of Earth, its
   natives oppressed by the rapacious Colonial Authority.

   Encountering each other in the Martian wastes, Terran outcast McCord
   and Martian warrior Thaklar engage in a wary truce and partnership for
   the sake of survival. Afterwards they are taken captive by the bandit
   chief Chastar and pressed into service of an expedition he has taken
   over. HIs other captives, the brother-and-sister Swedish archeological
   team of Karl and Inga Nordgen, have been searching for the legendary
   valley of Ophar, land of eternal youth, where life on Mars supposedly
   began; Chastar hopes to gain its treasures for himself.

   The party ultimately finds the valley, a prehistoric paradise whose
   true nature is masked by a protective illusion. There the group
   fragments, each member falling victim to the valley's uncanny and
   seemingly judgmental power, a radiation that alters all who enter it in
   accord with their inner natures. McCord and Thaklar are relatively
   unchanged, while the victimized Inga and hard-bitten Zerild, a renegade
   dancer allied with the bandits, recover their innocence. The evil
   Chastar and abusive Karl, however, are regressed into monsters.

   Freed from their captors, the Terran and Martian protagonists leave the
   valley and go their separate ways, McCord paired with Inga and Thaklar
   with Zerild.
