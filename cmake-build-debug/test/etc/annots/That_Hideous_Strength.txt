   The book, written during the final period of World War II, takes place
   at an undetermined year "after the end of the war".

   Mark Studdock is a young academic who has just become a Senior Fellow
   in sociology at Bracton College in the University of Edgestow. The
   fellows of Bracton are debating the sale of a portion of college land
   to the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments (N.I.C.E.),
   whose staff already includes some college faculty. The sale is
   controversial since the land in question (Bragdon Wood) is an ancient
   woodland believed to be the resting place of Merlin. After the deal is
   struck, a N.I.C.E. insider called Lord Feverstone proposes a possible
   post for Mark at the Institute. (It is gradually revealed that
   Feverstone is the new title of Richard Devine, who accompanied
   Professor Weston on the trip to Mars in Out of the Silent Planet, but
   not on the trip to Venus in Perelandra.)

   Mark's wife Jane (a PhD student at the university) has suffered a
   peculiar nightmare involving a severed head. She meets Mrs. Dimble, the
   wife of one of her former tutors, who is being evicted due to sale of
   land to the N.I.C.E. When Jane talks about her dreams, Mrs. Dimble
   leads her to seek counsel from a Miss Ironwood who lives in the Manor
   in the nearby town of St. Anne's. An argument between Jane and Mark
   shows how their marriage is deteriorating.

   Lord Feverstone introduces Mark to the N.I.C.E., where he becomes
   acquainted with the top brass at their headquarters at Belbury, near
   Edgestow. Mark can never find out what his place in the organisation
   is; he has no office, is given no duties for some time, and seems to be
   alternately in and out of favour. A scientist named Bill Hingest, who
   is resigning from the N.I.C.E., warns Mark to get out. That night,
   Hingest is mysteriously murdered.

   At the same time, Jane works up the courage to visit Miss Ironwood at
   St. Anne's. Miss Ironwood, who is dressed in black just as Jane had
   dreamed of her, is convinced that Jane's dreams are visions of genuine
   events. Later, Jane is introduced to Dr. Elwin Ransom, the protagonist
   of the first two books in Lewis's space trilogy. He has become the
   Pendragon or heir of King Arthur, the ruler of the nation of Logres,
   which is described as the good side of Britain. More mundanely, he is
   the Director of the group living in the Manor at St. Anne's. He is in
   communication with the Oyeresu (singular "Oyarsa"), angelic beings who
   guide the planets of the Solar System. Earth has been in quarantine:
   its rebellious Oyarsa (who is the Devil) and his demons could not
   travel beyond the orbit of the Moon, and the other Oyeresu could not
   come to Earth.

   Mark is finally given work: to write pseudonymous newspaper articles
   supporting the N.I.C.E., including two for use after a riot they intend
   to provoke in Edgestow. The riot takes place as planned, allowing the
   N.I.C.E.'s private police force to take over the town. They arrest
   Jane, whom the N.I.C.E. are interested in (as revealed later) for her
   psychic abilities, which they fear will get into their opponents'
   hands. The head of the N.I.C.E. police, a woman known as "Fairy"
   Hardcastle, starts to torture Jane but is forced to release her when
   rioters turn in her direction.

   Mark is once again out of favour in the N.I.C.E., but after a
   conversation with an Italian scientist named Filostrato he is
   introduced to the Head of the Institute. This turns out to be a literal
   head - that of a recently guillotined French scientist (as Jane
   dreamed) which Filostrato erroneously believes he has restored to life
   by his own efforts.

   From Jane's dreams that people were digging up the grave of a
   long-buried man and that the man had left, Ransom concludes that the
   N.I.C.E. is looking for the body of Merlin, who truly is buried in
   Bragdon Wood, though not dead but in a timeless state. Jane will guide
   members of the group to the place she dreamed of.

   The N.I.C.E. bosses now try to strengthen their hold over Mark by
   showing him trumped-up evidence that he murdered Bill Hingest. This
   backfires, as the crisis finally gives Mark the courage to leave
   Belbury. He returns to Edgestow in search of Jane only to find their
   apartment empty and the town under N.I.C.E. control. Later he meets
   Cecil Dimble, one of the St. Anne's community, who despite his
   misgivings offers to help him. Mark deliberates too long over Dimble's
   proposal and he is found and arrested for Hingest's murder.

   That night, during a heavy storm, both the company of St. Anne's and
   N.I.C.E. personnel are on the trail of Merlin, who has apparently
   revived. He has taken the clothes of a tramp through his powers of
   hypnosis and acquired a wild horse. He meets the company of St. Anne's
   but rides away. Members of the N.I.C.E. capture the tramp, believing
   him to be Merlin.

   Mark, while contemplating his upcoming trial and execution, discovers
   that he has not been arrested by the real police but by officials of
   the N.I.C.E. who (he now guesses) are the true murderers of Hingest. To
   his surprise he is told that he is to be initiated into the group's
   inner ring. In preparation for this he begins a bizarre program of
   training intended to cultivate absolute objectivity by relegating
   emotion to the status of a chemical phenomenon. He outwardly
   participates in these rituals (knowing that he will otherwise be
   killed) but inwardly begins to reject everything the N.I.C.E. stands
   for.

   Merlin arrives at St. Anne's ahead of his pursuers, where he and Ransom
   converse in Latin. Ransom reveals that there are Satanic forces behind
   the N.I.C.E. and that Merlin is to be possessed by the Oyeresu; since
   the forces of darkness broke the lunar barrier in the earlier books,
   the heavenly beings may also cross the barrier and intervene in human
   affairs.

   Jane has two mystical experiences; the first with the earth-bound
   counterpart of the Oyarsa of Venus, and the second with God. After
   discussions with Mrs. Dimble and the Director, she becomes a Christian.

   Merlin, now possessed by the Oyeresu, disguises himself as a Basque
   priest and answers the N.I.C.E.'s advertisement for an interpreter of
   ancient languages. He hypnotises and interviews the tramp (who the
   N.I.C.E. still believe may be the real Merlin) and the two of them are
   brought to a banquet. There Merlin pronounces the curse of Babel upon
   the assembled N.I.C.E. leaders, causing all present to speak gibberish,
   and also liberates the many animals on which the N.I.C.E. were
   experimenting. The bigger animals kill most of the N.I.C.E. staff.

   As earthquakes destroy the building, Lord Feverstone flees to Edgestow
   but is killed when that too is engulfed. Merlin helps Mark escape and
   sends him to St. Anne's. The Oyarsa of Venus lingers at the Manor, as
   Ransom is now to be transported back to that planet. When Mark arrives,
   a vision of Venus leads him into a bridal chamber that Jane has been
   preparing for him.
