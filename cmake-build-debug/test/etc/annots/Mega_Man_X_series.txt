   Mega Man X, commonly known as "X", was created by Dr. Thomas Light. X
   was a new type of robot with the ability to think, feel, and make his
   own decisions. Recognizing the potential danger of this model (in
   particular if he were to break the first rule of robotics: a robot must
   never harm a human being), Light sealed X away in a diagnostic capsule
   for over 30 years of testing. X's capsule was uncovered by an
   archaeologist named Dr. Cain almost 100 years after X's creation.
   Excited by the possibilities X presented, Cain disregarded the warnings
   Light had logged in the capsule and created a legion of robots that
   replicated X's free will; these robots were called "Reploids"
   (shortened from Replica Android, but known as "Repliroids" in Japan).

   A number of Reploids turned against humans. These Reploids were dubbed
   "Mavericks" ("Irregulars" in Japan), and a force called the Maverick
   Hunters ("Irregular Hunters") was formed to combat them. The Maverick
   Hunters were led by Sigma until he, too, became a Maverick and declared
   war against the humans, thus starting the Maverick War. X took it upon
   himself to join the Maverick Hunters under their new leader Zero.
   Throughout the series, X, Zero, and later Axl (a prototype of the
   next-generation Reploid) battle against the Mavericks to stop their
   plots to destroy the human race.

   After the series reached an unresolved cliffhanger, a game entitled
   "Mega Man X Dive" was released by Capcom Taiwan in which a human plays
   Mega Man X, until due in part to some corrupted data known as Maverick
   Data, he/she gets transported into the Deep Log, a massive database
   with data on every Mega Man game. The player must progress through the
   scrambled code of the Maverick War, Elf Wars, and the Game Of Destiny,
   to destroy the Maverick Data causing the slow corruption of the Deep
   Log.
