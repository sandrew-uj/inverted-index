   Eleven-year-old Charlie Bucket, his parents, and four grandparents all
   live in poverty in a small house outside a town which is home to a
   large chocolate factory. One day, Charlie's Grandpa Joe tells him about
   the legendary and eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka, who owns the
   town's chocolate factory, and all the wonderful sweets he made until
   the other chocolatiers sent in spies to steal his secret recipes,
   forcing Wonka to close the factory to outsiders. He reopened the
   factory three years later but the gates remained locked and nobody is
   sure who is providing the factory with its workforce.

   The next day, the newspaper announces that Wonka is re-opening the
   factory to the public and has invited five lucky children to come on a
   tour, with the passport to the factory being one of five Golden Tickets
   in a Wonka Bar. The first four golden tickets are found by gluttonous
   Augustus Gloop, spoiled Veruca Salt, chewing gum-addicted Violet
   Beauregarde, and television addict Mike Teavee. After the fourth ticket
   is found, Charlie's father loses his job in a toothpaste factory, and
   the family begins to starve, as the only job he can find is shoveling
   snow from the streets during a severe winter. An emaciated Charlie is
   returning home from school one day during this harsh weather when he
   sees a fifty-pence piece (a dollar bill in the US version) buried in
   the snow. He buys two Wonka Bars and miraculously finds the last Golden
   Ticket in the second. The ticket says he can bring one or two family
   members with him, and Grandpa Joe agrees to go, suddenly regaining his
   mobility at the age of 96 after years of being bedridden.

   On the day of the tour, Wonka welcomes the five children and their
   parents inside the factory, a wonderland of confectionery creations
   that defy logic. They also meet the Oompa-Loompas, a race of little
   people who help him operate the factory. During the tour, the other
   four children give in to their impulses and are ejected from the tour
   in darkly comical ways: Augustus gets sucked into the pipe to the Fudge
   Room after drinking from the Chocolate River; Violet blows up into a
   giant blueberry after chewing an experimental stick of
   three-course-dinner gum; Veruca and her parents are thrown down the
   garbage chute after she tries to capture one of the nut-testing
   squirrels, who deem the Salts "Bad Nuts"; and finally Mike gets shrunk
   down to the size of a chocolate bar after misusing the Wonkavision
   device despite Wonka's warnings, causing him to be "sent by
   television". The Oompa-Loompas sing about the children's poor behaviour
   each time disaster strikes.

   With only Charlie remaining, Wonka congratulates him for "winning" the
   factory. Wonka explains that the whole tour was designed to help him
   secure a good person to serve as an heir to his business, and Charlie
   was the only child whose inherent goodness allowed him to pass the
   test. They ride the Great Glass Elevator and watch the other four
   children leave the factory before flying to Charlie's house, where
   Wonka then invites Charlie's entire family to come and live with him in
   the factory.
