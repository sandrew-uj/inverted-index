   Danny, his friend Joe Pearson, Professor Bulfinch and Doctor Grimes are
   flying a small private jet over the Pacific Ocean. The plane is forced
   to crash land on an uncharted desert island. Armed only with the items
   in their pockets, the four must create a living environment and come up
   with a plan to be rescued.
