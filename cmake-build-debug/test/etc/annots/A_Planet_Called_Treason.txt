   The premise of this novel is the banishment to the seemingly metal-poor
   planet Treason of a group of people who attempted to create rule by an
   intellectual elite. The novel centers on the descendants of these
   anti-democratic thinkers who remain imprisoned on the planet. Through
   the ages, these descendants have formed nations which warred and allied
   with one another to gain advantages over their rivals in the race to
   build a starship. Due to the metal-deficiency on Treason, nations are
   forced to obtain it through a system of barter using teleportation
   devices known as Ambassadors.

   The protagonist of the book is Lanik Mueller, heir apparent to the
   Mueller family kingdom. The Muellers, through generations of eugenics,
   have the ability to heal at an accelerated speed and regrow body parts
   naturally. The dark side to the Mueller nation is that, in order to
   obtain iron and other metals, they trade organs and body parts, which
   are harvested from radical regeneratives ("rads"). Radical
   regeneratives are people whose bodies can't distinguish between health
   and injury, and so grow extra appendages as well as organs of the
   opposite sex; although this is a normal phase for most Muellers at the
   age of puberty, the bodies of radical regeneratives never outgrow it.

   After it is discovered that Lanik is a radical regenerative, Lanik's
   father must essentially banish him from the kingdom, so as to avoid
   sending him to the "pens", a place where radical regeneratives are kept
   in order to harvest their body parts; exile also functions to get Lanik
   out of the eye of the Mueller public, as well as to prevent harm from
   coming to Lanik's supposed younger brother Dinte. The banishment comes
   in the form of sending Lanik as an emissary and spy to the Nkumai, a
   rival nation. Due to his radical regenerative body, Lanik has grown
   breasts, which makes him appear to be a woman. Using this subterfuge,
   he poses as an ambassador from the matriarchal nation of Bird in order
   to discover what the Nkumai are trading in exchange for their abundant
   metals, which have allowed them to dominate their region militarily.

   This mission is only the beginning of the adventure for Lanik, who
   discovers the secrets of the most powerful nations and at the same time
   gains additional abilities to save his people and determine the fate of
   his planet.
