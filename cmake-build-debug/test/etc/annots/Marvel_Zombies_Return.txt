   Following Marvel Zombies 2, Earth-2149's surviving mutant and metahuman
   zombies (Spider-Man, Wolverine, Giant-Man, Wasp, and Luke Cage) and
   also Black Panther have been transported to an alternate universe by
   Malcolm Cortez.

   The first issue revolves around the attempts of Zombie Spider-Man to
   cure himself of his condition when he lands on an Earth similar to his
   own, later designated "Earth-Z". Upon becoming aware that his
   counterpart from this universe is still in college and that Kingpin has
   yet to steal the Lifeline Tablet, the Zombie Spider-Man tries to
   recover it first to see if he can use it to cure himself and become a
   hero again. However, alerted by his presence, Kingpin hires the
   Sinister Six -- Kraven The Hunter, Mysterio, Electro, The Vulture,
   Doctor Octopus and Sandman to create a distraction so he can steal the
   tablet. However, Zombie Spider-Man ends up killing Kingpin and all the
   Sinister Six minus Sandman, who in turn brutally kills the Spider-Man
   of this Earth. Due his actions, however, the zombified members of the
   Sinister Six kill his friends and Zombie Spider-Man kills them for good
   to prevent spreading the contagion. The issue also advances the
   overarching storyline by having Zombie Giant-Man attack and eat
   Earth-Z's Uatu the Watcher.

   The second issue follows Earth-Z's Tony Stark, who is having alcoholism
   problems and is on the verge of selling Stark International and all
   patents to the Chinese, two years after Zombie Spider-Man's arrival to
   Earth-Z. Upon teletransporting himself to Stark International's
   basement in search of Stark's Inhuman technology, Zombie Giant-Man
   infects Happy Hogan, who in turn causes the infection of all people in
   the building except Tony Stark and James Rhodes, who makes his way to
   Tony's office and dons Stark's armor. After killing the zombified
   Pepper Potts with nanobots that can destroy the zombies, Tony passes on
   the Iron Man armor to Rhodes and stays behind to be killed by the
   zombies while Rhodes leaves the building to destroy the remaining
   zombies, precluding the contagion from spreading further.

   The third issue follows Earth-2149's Zombie Wolverine, who makes his
   way to Japan four years after his arrival to Earth-Z concurrently at
   the same time Earth-Z's Wolverine and Kitty Pryde are trying to
   dismantle the criminal operations of The Hand. As Zombie Wolverine
   devours Kitty's ninja pursuers, Zombie Spider-Man rescues Kitty and
   tells her about the origin of the plague and the vaccine he has created
   to control Zombie Wolverine's hunger. Meanwhile, Zombie Wolverine kills
   Shang-Chi, Elektra, Sunfire and Iron Fist until Earth-Z's Wolverine
   appears, engaging in a fight. With the intervention of Kitty Pryde and
   Zombie Spider-Man, Wolverine manages to kill his zombie counterpart,
   his zombified victims and lets Zombie Spider-Man to get a sample of his
   blood to develop a cure, and while he becomes infected through unknown
   reasons, he resists the hunger and doesn't spread the contagion.

   The fourth issue follows the return of Earth-Z's Hulk to the Blue Area
   of the Moon years after Zombie Wolverine's attack on Japan and
   following his banishment to Sakaar by the Illuminati. Upon arriving
   along with the Warbound, Hulk discovers Zombie Giant-Man and the
   zombified Inhumans, which leads to the deaths of all the Warbound
   members and with the former infecting him before he makes his way back
   to Earth. Back on home, the zombified Hulk starts devouring all
   citizens he can on New York City until the Illuminati contact the
   Sentry to stop him. However, reverting back to his zombified human
   form, Hulk takes advantage to infect Sentry as well, leading Zombie
   Spider-Man to realize that things have gone too far and that they must
   act now.

   The fifth issue ties these threads together, resolving the fates of all
   of the original Marvel Zombies. Years after Hulk's attack on NYC,
   Earth-Z has suffered the same fate Earth-2149 endured and there is no
   longer life on it, with the Avengers (Sentry, Moon Knight, Thundra,
   Quasar, Super-Skrull, Namor, Quicksilver) revealed to have killed
   Earth-2149's Wasp, Luke Cage and Black Panther while Zombie Giant-Man
   is working on a dimensional teleporter to devour more universes.
   However, thanks to Earth-Z's zombified Professor X, the Avengers are
   led to a trap and engage in a battle against Zombie Spider-Man and the
   New Avengers (Earth-Z's Wolverine, Hulk, Iron Man and Sandman). Zombie
   Giant-Man then teletransports all of them to Uatu's laboratory to use
   Sentry as power the teleporter. However, the nanite-infused Sandman
   ends up killing all zombies present minus Sentry, who is trapped on the
   teletransporter. At the end, Earth-Z's Uatu reveals himself to be alive
   and shunts the Sentry, the last Earth-Z Marvel Zombie, back through
   time and dimensions to his arrival on Earth-2149 (the original Marvel
   Zombies universe). In doing so, it closes a time loop, which keeps the
   virus contained on Earths 2149 and Z, both of which it has devastated,
   since (according to the Watcher himself) no one has the ability to
   destroy it outright, so there is no other option than let the hunger
   devour itself.

   Given the number of Marvel Zombie sequels since then, however, that
   conclusion would seem to be one of Uatu's few misjudgments. There is
   also the fact that the original mini-series had two contradictory
   explanations as to how the Zombie Sentry first arrived on Earth-2149.
   Falling through an interdimensional portal, from the "Pearly Gates,"
   alongside Ash Williams; and materializing aboard the Asteroid M of
   Earth-2149's Magneto (who subsequently--and misguidedly--exploited him
   as a bio-hazard weapon against the normal humans of the latter world).
   It must, therefore, be concluded that one of those Zombie Sentries must
   have been from still another parallel-Earth, where a similar outbreak
   occurred or, at the very least, was narrowly averted.
