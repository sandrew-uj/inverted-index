   In the 1970s, an impoverished and intelligent thirty-seven-year-old
   Mexican-American woman Consuelo (Connie) Ramos, a resident of Spanish
   Harlem, is unfairly incarcerated in a New York mental hospital due to
   her supposed violent criminal tendencies. She had been recently
   released from a previous voluntary commitment in a mental institution
   after an episode of drug-related child neglect, which led her also to
   lose custody of her daughter. Connie is caught within the government
   welfare and child custody labyrinth of 1970s New York City. She is
   after the first scene recommitted involuntarily by her niece's pimp on
   grounds of violent behavior, after she strikes him in the course of
   protecting her niece, Dolly (Dolores), from him. Dolly had sought
   protection from Connie because she was being forced by the pimp into
   having an (illegal) abortion.

   One of Connie's chief abilities is her perceptiveness and empathy. As a
   result, before being committed, Connie had for some time begun to
   communicate with ("receive" from) a figure from the future: an
   androgynous young woman named Luciente. Connie retains her visions and
   her connection, which become more and more real, even while heavily
   drugged in the mental hospital in New York, based loosely on Bellevue
   and other mental institutions from that period. Luciente is
   time-traveling from a future (the date is given as 2137), in which a
   number of goals of the political and social agenda of the late sixties'
   and early seventies' radical movements have been fulfilled.
   Environmental pollution, patriarchy, homelessness, homophobia, racism,
   ethnocentrism, phallogocentrism, sexism, class-subordination, food
   injustice, consumerism, imperialism, and totalitarianism have been
   effectively dealt with in this world, which is governmentally
   decentralized in a loose version of anarchism.

   In contrast to the contemporary 1970s setting in an abusive mental
   institution where patients are labelled "violent," "incapable,"
   "irrational," etc. on the basis of their response to an unjust and
   harshly stratified class-, race-, and gender-ridden society, future
   dwellers experience enormous personal freedom and train one another in
   self-control and ways of producing win-win results in all social
   situations. In particular, the subjects of volition and free will,
   mental institutionalization, and interference in others' willed actions
   are key to the vision of the utopian future. Connie is introduced by
   Luciente to the agrarian, communal community of Mattapoisett, where
   children grow up in a culture where they are encouraged to know
   themselves and their own minds and emotions thoroughly through
   practicing a type of meditation from an early age ("in-knowing"), in
   the service of social harmony and the ability to communicate with
   others without domination or subservience.

   This classless, gender-neutral (non-gendered pronouns are used, notably
   "per" or "person" for "he/she/him/her"), racial-difference-affirming
   society is sketched in detail, including meeting and discussion
   structures that eliminate power differentials as much as possible, the
   extensive use of technology only for social goods, the replacement of
   business and corporate agendas with general planning for social justice
   and respect for all human beings' individuality. Disputes between towns
   and regions are settled peacefully through discussion and merit-based
   competition of ideas, with the winning parties being obliged to "throw
   a big party for" or otherwise conciliate the losers in each case, in
   order to maintain friendly relations.

   A 70s emphasis on individual freedom can be seen at times: each person
   lives in a private tent or one-room home, and children develop outside
   the womb of an individual and are adopted by three "mothers" (of any
   gender) who guard and teach them only until puberty; every person
   chooses their own name, and can also choose their field of study and
   work, as well as when to disengage from their community, or join a new
   one; total freedom also applies to one's mental and emotional
   choices--in this future world one can check oneself into and out of the
   equivalent of a sanitorium at will, go into or out of various kinds of
   therapy, or take a mental break in some other way, and no other person
   has the right to choose this on one's behalf. One's field of work is
   self-chosen, and dicta apply to both one's life path and one's mental
   or emotional desires, needs, and capacities: "Per must not do what per
   cannot do" and "Per must do what per needs to do" are applied to both
   personal/emotional and professional life choices insofar as possible.
   There are limits to this utopia, which threaten always at the margins:
   the death penalty is imposed on occasion, and war is in the background,
   but both are considered extreme and unusual measures.

   Connie learns tools of emotional and physical survival from Luciente
   and the future population of Mattapoisett, and comes to feel that she
   is living at an important time in history, and that she herself is in a
   pivotal position; her actions and decisions will determine the course
   of history. In particular, it is slowly revealed that Luciente's utopia
   is only one possible future; alternate futures are a possibility, and
   the novel shows us one example-- a future consumerist,
   hyper-capitalist, environmentally sick and strictly classist, racist,
   and gender-stratified society in which a wealthy elite live on space
   platforms, sustaining themselves by dominating and exploiting the
   majority of the population through total control of knowledge and
   technology, personal control extending to physical "farming" of bodies
   (harvesting organs regularly) and the surgical control of moods through
   the use of psychotropic drugs. Women in this intensely violent,
   misogynistic and homophobic world are valued and "grown" solely for
   appearance and sexuality, and plastic surgery that gives women
   grotesquely exaggerated sexual features is commonplace.

   The novel criticizes mental institutions and hospitalization of its
   time extensively, and brings the problem of free will to the forefront
   as well as suggesting alternative routes to mental wellness and social
   reform. It does not decide for the reader whether Connie's visions are
   by-products of her mental instability or are literal time-travel, but
   ultimately, Connie's confrontation with the future inspires her to
   violent revolt against her institutional captors. She uses her limited
   means, despite her very restricted situation, in a desperate and
   apparently heroic way to prevent the dissemination of the mind-control
   technology that makes the future dystopia possible, putting an end to
   the mind-control experiments and prevents the lobotomy operation that
   had been planned for her and hundreds of other imprisoned patients.
   Connie acts in the tradition of revolts by oppressed or subaltern
   classes to put a wrench into the system of oppression within which she
   is caught. Though her revolutionary action ensures her own permanent
   incarceration and possible death sentence, and may not ensure the
   existence of the Mattapoisett future, Connie nevertheless sees her act
   as a victory, and perhaps the reader is encouraged to agree: "I'm a
   dead woman now too. ... But I did fight them. ... I tried."^[1]
