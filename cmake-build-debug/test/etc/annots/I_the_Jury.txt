   The novel opens as private detective Mike Hammer is called to the
   apartment of insurance investigator Jack Williams, a very close friend
   who was crippled saving Hammer's life during shared World War II
   military service in the Pacific. Losing his arm rendered Jack unfit for
   police work, so he put his experience to use by investigating insurance
   fraud. Williams has been murdered in a particularly cruel way,
   deliberately shot in the stomach to make the death slow and painful.
   Mike vows vengeance, declaring that Jack's murderer will die the same
   way Jack did.

   Prior to his death, Jack had fallen in love with Myrna Devlin when he
   stopped her from committing suicide by jumping from a bridge. Williams
   asked Dr. Charlotte Manning, a young, beautiful, blonde, and well-to-do
   psychiatrist, to admit Myrna to her clinic for psychotherapy. After
   Myrna became clean, she and Williams became engaged. The couple
   maintained a casual friendship with Manning. Over time, Williams comes
   to suspect that Hal Kines, one of Manning's college students who has
   spent some time at her clinic and who has become one of her casual
   acquaintances, is in fact a criminal.

   In the course of his investigation, Hammer meets and begins to fall in
   love with Dr. Manning. In the course of the novel, they become engaged.

   Taking time out from his investigation on a Saturday morning, Hammer
   picks up Myrna Devlin and gives her a lift to an estate in the country,
   owned by the lovely Bellamy twins, for a gigantic all-day party.
   Charlotte Manning says she has some business to attend to and will be
   there in time for a tennis game due to take place that evening. After
   an unsuccessful attempt at playing tennis himself, Hammer gets rid of
   his sleep deficit by spending all day in his room, fast asleep, with
   "old junior" -- his gun -- close to him. He is woken up just in time
   for dinner, during which Harmon Wilder, the Bellamys' lawyer, and
   Charles Sherman, Wilder's assistant, are pointed out to him. This is a
   fine -- and the final -- distractor in the novel: Wilder and Sherman
   are suddenly missing from the party after Myrna Devlin has been found
   shot. In fact they had illicit drugs on them and did not want to be
   found out. During the tennis game, Mary Bellamy asks Charlotte if she
   can "borrow" Hammer. She then leads him into the woods, where they have
   sex. They return to the party just as a maid discovers Myrna's body in
   an upstairs room, in front of a large mirror. Both Hammer's friend Pat
   Chambers and other police are called in, and the alibi of each guest is
   checked.

   Now having another reason to seek vengeance, Hammer redoubles his
   efforts to discover the killer. Soon he has uncovered a wide-ranging
   narcotics rings, one that Jack had been on the verge of exposing.

   Back home, Hammer retreats into his apartment to think. Finally, he
   knows the identity of the killer: Dr. Manning. Confronting her, Hammer
   keeps his promise and kills her in the same excruciatingly painful way
   she had killed his friend Jack.

   When the dying murderer asks Hammer how he could act in such a cruel
   manner, Hammer replies "It was easy!".
