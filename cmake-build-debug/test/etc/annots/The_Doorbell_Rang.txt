   Fred J. Cook's 1964 expose, The FBI Nobody Knows, is central to the
   plot of The Doorbell Rang

   Rachel Bruner, a wealthy Manhattan widow, has recently incurred the
   wrath of the FBI. After reading a book called The FBI Nobody Knows, a
   prominent critique of the many unethical practices of the Bureau, she
   has mailed 10,000 copies of it to prominent figures across the country.
   Having endured several incidents of harassment and prying, she offers
   to hire Wolfe to persuade the FBI to leave her alone. Although
   initially hesitant of making a powerful enemy, Wolfe is persuaded over
   Archie's objections when Bruner offers a $50,000 retainer and then
   doubles it to $100,000, as well as a fee and any expenses he may incur.
   He is also sympathetic to both Bruner's plight and the arguments made
   in the book, and decides not to withdraw in the face of what he sees as
   heavy-handed and bullying opposition tactics.

   As the FBI put Wolfe and Archie under surveillance, Wolfe plans to gain
   examples of FBI malfeasance and use it to persuade the FBI to back
   down. Archie's initial investigations prove fruitless, but he soon
   receives an anonymous message from Dr. Vollmer, Wolfe's physician,
   asking for a clandestine meeting. Although initially suspecting an FBI
   trap, Archie is astonished to learn that the message is from Inspector
   Cramer. Cramer reveals that the FBI are attempting to have Wolfe and
   Archie's private investigator licenses revoked. He also reveals that he
   suspects that FBI agents may be involved in the murder of Morris
   Althaus, a freelance journalist who was researching an article critical
   of the Bureau, two months earlier. Althaus was found shot to death in
   his apartment, but the fatal bullet was never recovered; in addition,
   his research notes were also missing. Cramer, who is opposed to the
   FBI's efforts to sabotage Wolfe and stonewall the police's homicide
   investigation, offers to write a report favourable to Wolfe and Archie
   if Wolfe proves that the FBI are responsible for the murder of Althaus.

   Wolfe instead decides that it would serve his purposes better to prove
   that the FBI had no part in the murder. He also devises a plan to trap
   the FBI. Acting on the suspicion that the FBI have secretly bugged
   Wolfe's office, Wolfe gathers the key suspects in his office and
   publicly claims that he is gathering proof that FBI agents murdered
   Althaus and are covering it up, while directing Archie to conduct his
   own investigation.

   Archie discovers that Sarah Dacos, Bruner's secretary, lives in the
   same apartment building as Althaus and claimed to have seen FBI agents
   leaving the apartment on the night of the murder. When Wolfe and Archie
   question her, Dacos claims only a casual acquaintance with Althaus, but
   Archie remains suspicious of her. Acting on a hunch, he breaks into
   Dacos's apartment, where he discovers proof that Dacos and Althaus were
   engaged in an affair. He also discovers the gun that was used to kill
   Althaus. Archie realises that Dacos murdered Althaus after he broke off
   their relationship to marry another woman, and that he needs to leave
   the gun behind. He moves it to a new hiding place, but worries that
   Dacos will dispose of it before Wolfe and Archie can prove her guilt.

   Meanwhile, Wolfe has been preparing his trap for the FBI. Publicly
   arranging a dinner with his old friend and fellow orchid lover Lewis
   Hewitt, he privately hires two actors resembling himself and Archie and
   has them smuggled into the brownstone, along with his operatives Saul
   Panzer, Fred Durkin and Orrie Cather. The actors are sent to Hewitt's
   dinner posing as Wolfe and Archie, while Wolfe, Archie and the
   operatives secretly remain in the brownstone. Having spread his public
   suspicions of the FBI and his plans for the house to be empty, Wolfe
   suspects that the FBI will use the opportunity to break in and steal
   any evidence he has that FBI agents murdered Althaus.

   Two agents break into the house that night, only to be held at gunpoint
   by Archie and the operatives. Wolfe confiscates their credentials,
   having obtained conclusive proof of the FBI's harassment of a private
   citizen and conduct of illegal activities. The next day, Wolfe meets
   with senior FBI official Richard Wragg and offers a deal, with Bruner
   watching through the office peephole. Wolfe refuses to return the
   credentials, but offers to abstain from pressing charges and publicly
   embarrassing the FBI, in exchange for the FBI ceasing all surveillance
   and harassment of Bruner and those connected to her, including Archie
   and himself. He adds that he can prove that FBI agents were not
   responsible for Althaus' murder.

   After Wragg agrees to Wolfe's terms, Archie approaches Inspector Cramer
   and gives him a lead on Dacos. After the police search her apartment
   and find the gun, Dacos is arrested for the murder. Wolfe then gathers
   Wragg and Cramer in his office and negotiates a deal between them. In
   exchange for Wragg handing over the missing bullet that will prove
   Dacos' guilt, taken by the FBI along with Althaus' research notes,
   Cramer will conceal any involvement on the part of the FBI. Wragg and
   Cramer reluctantly agree to Wolfe's deal.

   The novel ends with Wolfe and Archie receiving an unidentified but
   important visitor, implied to be J. Edgar Hoover. Speculating that he
   has come in person to collect the FBI credentials, Wolfe refuses to let
   him into the house, leaving the visitor to keep ringing the doorbell.
