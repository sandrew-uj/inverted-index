   Spider-Man reaches Mary Jane Watson-Parker and Aunt-May Parker to find
   them safe and sound. When questioned about the current situation, Peter
   confesses to being bitten by Colonel America. Peter then succumbs to
   the virus, attacking Mary Jane as Aunt May runs into the room in
   dismay.

   As the battle between infected zombies and non-infected humans rages
   on, Magneto, on board Asteroid M, feels sorry for bringing the virus to
   Earth-2149 and returns to the planet to help. Nova arrives at the
   Parker flat to find the zombified Spider-Man devouring the slain Mary
   Jane and Aunt May and tries to reason with him. At this point Daredevil
   shows up to explain to Nova what is going on, and that the rules have
   changed. Daredevil is infected by Zombie Peter in the process.

   Meanwhile, the zombified Colonel America has a moment of clarity and
   leads the rest of the infected Avengers to the Avengers Mansion to try
   to find a cure for the virus. At the Xavier Institute for Gifted
   Youngsters in Salem Center, Westchester County, Storm, Cyclops,
   Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat and Colossus try to fend off the
   newly undead Alpha Flight (including Sasquatch) to protect the
   surviving students in the mansion, although Professor Xavier has
   already been killed by the Alpha Flight zombies. Magneto shows up and
   recruits the X-Men to work with him in fighting the zombified heroes
   after disposing of the zombified Alpha Flight.

   Aiming to find a cure Giant Man and Black Panther make their way to his
   lab. Black Panther realizes Giant Man is infected, but is knocked
   unconscious by Giant Man before he can do anything. Zombie Giant Man
   plans to keep Black Panther as a living cadaver to save him the trouble
   of searching for food when the infection spreads.

   Quicksilver seemingly rescues his sister Scarlet Witch from Zombie
   Black Cat only to be revealed that it is actually a Zombie Mystique in
   disguise who proceeds to bite and infect Quicksilver thus spreading the
   disease from North America (United States and Canada) to other parts of
   the Earth such as Britain, Russia and Japan.

   As the battle rages on, Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Thing,
   and the Human Torch mourn the death of Franklin Richards and Valeria
   Richards at the hands of She-Hulk, who has been infected. As Sue kills
   Zombie She-Hulk there is an incoming transmission from Nick Fury.

   Back in the heat of battle, Thor fights against his previous allies
   including zombified Giant Man. Nova shows up to help Thor in the brawl.
   The Fantastic Four arrive in their Fantasticar to lead Thor and Nova to
   the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicopter where Nick Fury is calling all the
   remaining superheroes and villains together in an attempt to counter
   the virus.

   Nick Fury informs all that the epicenter of the infection was in New
   York City specifically Manhattan. The Avengers were first on the scene
   and as such first to be infected. He also declares that anyone who
   isn't infected should be considered an ally. Nick Fury puts Iron Man,
   Hulk, and Mr. Fantastic into researching a cure for the contagion. Fury
   then assigns everyone else to go out and rescue who they can. Nova
   protests that the infection is too far gone to be stopped, but is
   silenced by Fury.

   Zombie Giant-Man arrives back at the Avengers Mansion, infected and
   looking for a new snack in Jarvis. Realizing the other Avengers have
   beaten him to it, the Zombie Avengers talk about their resolution to
   give up the fight and accept their new condition.

   Dr. Doom watches the ongoing fight from his secure fortress at Latveria
   and refuses to aid Fury in his plans.

   Back on the Helicarrier, Mister Fantastic is busy researching a zombie.
   Sue walks in asking why he is not helping Iron Man and Hulk with their
   research for a cure, which Mister Fantastic defends by saying that they
   are approaching the problem from all angles. The Fantastic Four then
   get in a fight over Mister Fantastic's thoughts that the zombies are
   like advanced lifeforms.

   Fury checks on Iron Man who has decided to build a machine that will
   teleport them to an alternate universe similar to their own, reasoning
   that reconstruction would take too long with so many dead even if the
   virus was stopped immediately. Iron Man hopes to have the machine
   operational as soon as possible.

   Back on the ground, the resistance is losing the fight against the
   zombies, with Wolverine and Nova succumbing to the virus, and have to
   retreat back to the helicopter.

   Mister Fantastic calls the rest of the Fantastic Four to his lab to
   discuss his findings. Insane, Reed now believes that the infection is
   evolution and as such has infected the team. Reed then allows them to
   feed on him and in turn infect him, wanting to experience the change
   himself.

   Just as Iron Man finishes the machine, the Zombified Fantastic Four
   burst into the room and infect him. Fury grabs the machine and pulls it
   into a small room where some of the last remaining heroes have
   gathered. Realizing that completing the machine will give the zombies
   the opportunity to spread their infection to other realities, Fury
   commands Thor to destroy the machine and for this the zombies kill him,
   while turning the remaining heroes.

   When asked what will happen next, Zombie Reed responds that he shall
   rebuild the machine and "spread the gospel."
