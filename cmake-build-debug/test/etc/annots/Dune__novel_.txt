   Duke Leto Atreides of the House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet
   Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as
   fief ruler of the planet Arrakis. Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable
   desert planet, and the only source of melange, or "the spice", an
   extremely expensive and exclusive substance that extends human youth,
   vitality and lifespan--which is the official reason for its high demand
   in the Empire, and more importantly is also the secret behind the Bene
   Gesserit and Guild navigators's further increased mental capabilities.
   Shaddam sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat, and
   conspires with House Harkonnen, the longstanding enemies of House
   Atreides among the other Great Houses in the Landsraad, to destroy Leto
   and his family after their arrival on Arrakis. Leto is aware his
   assignment is a trap of some kind, but cannot refuse.

   Leto's concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an
   exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and
   wields superhuman physical powers. Though Jessica was instructed by the
   Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their breeding program, out
   of love for Leto she bore a son, Paul. From a young age, Paul has been
   trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiers Duncan Idaho and
   Gurney Halleck, and the old Mentat Thufir Hawat have prepared him for
   becoming a future mentat himself if he so desires. Jessica has also
   trained Paul in what Bene Gesserit disciplines she can. His prophetic
   dreams interest Jessica's superior, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
   Mohiam. She subjects Paul to the gom jabbar, a deadly test which causes
   blinding pain as part of an assessment of the subject's humanity. To
   her surprise, Paul manages to pass despite being exposed to more pain
   than any others before him.

   Leto, Jessica and Paul travel with their household to occupy Arrakeen,
   the stronghold on Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen. Leto learns
   of the dangers involved in harvesting the spice, which is protected by
   giant sandworms, and negotiates with the planet's native Fremen people,
   seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the
   Atreides' arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's
   ferocious Sardaukar troops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his
   personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, who delivers a
   drugged Leto to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his twisted Mentat,
   Piter De Vries. Yueh, however, arranges for Jessica and Paul to escape
   into the desert, where they are presumed dead by the Harkonnens. Yueh
   replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison capsule, hoping Leto can
   kill the Baron during their encounter. Yueh is murdered by De Vries
   upon delivering Leto, while the Baron narrowly avoids the gas, which
   instead kills Leto and De Vries. The Baron forces Hawat to take over De
   Vries' position. While he follows the Baron's orders, Hawat works to
   undermine the Harkonnens.

   After fleeing into the desert, Paul realizes he has significant powers
   as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme, inadvertently caused
   by Jessica bearing a son and his exposure to high concentrations of
   melange. He foresees futures in which he lives among the planet's
   native Fremen, and has a vision where he is informed of the addictive
   qualities of the spice. It is also revealed Jessica is the daughter of
   Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the Bene Gesserit. Paul and
   Jessica are accepted into the Fremen community of Sietch Tabr, and
   teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known as the
   "weirding way". Paul proves his manhood and chooses the Fremen name
   Muad'Dib, while Jessica opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend
   Mother by drinking the poisonous Water of Life. Pregnant with Leto's
   daughter, she inadvertently causes the unborn child, Alia, to become
   infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover,
   Chani, and has a son with her, Leto II.

   Two years pass, and Paul's powerful prescience abilities manifest,
   which lead the Fremen to consider him as their messiah, due to Bene
   Gesserit's Missionaria Protectiva. Paul recognizes that the Fremen
   could be a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees
   that if he does not control them, their jihad could consume the entire
   universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both Baron Harkonnen
   and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly
   destructive raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephew Glossu
   Rabban to rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder
   nephew Feyd-Rautha will make the latter popular among the people of
   Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the
   Baron of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to
   seize power, sends spies to monitor activity on Arrakis. Hawat uses the
   opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true
   plans, putting further strain on their alliance.

   Gurney Halleck, having survived the Harkonnen coup, reunites with Paul
   and Jessica. Believing Jessica to be a traitor, Gurney threatens to
   kill her, but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack,
   and concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of
   Life, which is fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for
   several weeks after drinking the Water, but when he wakes, he has
   clairvoyance across time and space: he is the Kwisatz Haderach, the
   ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.

   Paul senses the Emperor and Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to
   quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major
   offensive against the Harkonnen troops. The Emperor arrives with the
   Baron on Arrakis; their combined troops seize a Fremen outpost, killing
   many including Leto II, while Alia is captured and taken to the Baron.
   She remains defiant, putting her trust in her brother. Under cover of
   an electric storm which shorts out the Emperor's troops' defensive
   shields, Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, assault the
   capital while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen
   quickly defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops.

   Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever
   unless the Emperor abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha attempts to stop
   Paul by challenging him to a ritualistic knife fight, during which he
   attempts to cheat and kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt. Paul
   gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the
   throne to Paul and promises his daughter Princess Irulan's hand in
   marriage. As Paul takes control of the Empire, he realizes that while
   he has achieved his goal, he is no longer able to stop the Fremen
   jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.
