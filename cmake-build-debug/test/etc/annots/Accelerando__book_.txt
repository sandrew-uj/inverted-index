   The book is a collection of nine short stories telling the tale of
   three generations of a family before, during, and after a technological
   singularity. It was originally written as a series of novelettes and
   novellas, all published in Asimov's Science Fiction magazine in the
   period 2001 to 2004. According to Stross, the initial inspiration for
   the stories was his experience working as a programmer for a
   high-growth company during the dot-com boom of the 1990s.^[3]

   The first three stories follow the character of agalmic "venture
   altruist" Manfred Macx, starting in the early 21st century; the second
   three stories follow his daughter Amber; and the final three focus
   largely on Amber's son Sirhan in the completely transformed world at
   the end of the century.
