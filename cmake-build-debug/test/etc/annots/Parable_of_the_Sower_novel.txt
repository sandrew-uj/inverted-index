   Beginning in 2024, when society in the United States has grown unstable
   due to climate change, growing wealth inequality, and corporate greed,
   Parable of the Sower takes the form of a journal kept by Lauren Oya
   Olamina, an African American teenager. Her mother abused drugs during
   her pregnancy and left Lauren with "hyper-empathy" or "sharing" - the
   uncontrollable ability to feel the sensations she witnesses in others,
   particularly the abundant pain in her world.

   Lauren grows up in the remnants of a gated community in Robledo,
   California, twenty miles from Los Angeles, where she and her neighbors
   struggle but are separate from the abject poverty of the world outside.
   Outside of the community are numerous homeless and mutilated
   individuals who resent the community members for their relative
   affluence. Public services such as police or firefighters are
   untrustworthy, exploiting their positions for profit and making little
   effort to help. Lauren's father, a Baptist pastor, holds the community
   together through mutual aid and careful use of resources, such as
   making bread from acorns. However, Lauren is increasingly certain that
   despite all efforts, society will continue to deteriorate and the
   community will no longer be safe; Lauren secretly prepares to travel
   north, as many do in search of rare paid jobs. The newly elected
   radical, authoritarian President Donner loosens labor protections,
   creating a rise in company towns owned by foreign businesses. Lauren
   privately develops her own new belief system based on the belief that
   "God is Change" is the only lasting truth, and that humanity, dubbed
   Earthseed, should "shape God" in order to aid themselves. She comes to
   call this religion Earthseed.

   Lauren's youngest brother, Keith, rebelliously runs away to live
   outside the walls of the community. For a time, he survives by joining
   a group of ruthless thieves who value him for his rare literacy, but he
   is eventually found dead after torture. Later, Lauren's father
   disappears while leaving the community for work, and is accepted as
   dead.

   When Lauren is eighteen in 2027, the community's security is breached
   in an organized attack by outsiders: most of the community is
   destroyed, looted, and murdered, including Lauren's family. She travels
   north, disguised as a man, with Harry Balter and Zahra Moss, two
   survivors from her community. Society outside the community walls has
   reverted to chaos due to resource scarcity and poverty. U.S. states
   have become akin to city-states, with strict borders. Money still has
   value, but travelers constantly fear attacks for resources or by
   pyromaniac drug-users, cannibals, and wild dogs. Mixed-race
   relationships are stigmatized and women fear sexual assault. Slavery
   has returned in the form of indebted servitude.

   Lauren gathers people to protect along her journey and begins to share
   the Earthseed religion, which is developing into a collection of texts
   titled Earthseed: The Books of the Living. She believes that
   humankind's destiny is to travel beyond the deteriorating Earth and
   live on other planets, forcing humankind into its adulthood, and that
   Earthseed is preparation for this destiny. Lauren begins a relationship
   with Bankole, an older doctor who joins the group, and agrees to marry
   him. Bankole takes the group to the land he owns in Northern
   California, where the group settles and Lauren founds the first
   Earthseed community, Acorn.
