   Humanity has colonized the solar system and moved outward to begin
   exploring the far reaches of the galaxy. An interplanetary audience
   follows real-life stories of triumph and tragedy presented to them by
   Duncan Chalk, a media mogul with apparently limitless resources. Chalk,
   unknown to all around him, is a kind of psychic vampire who draws
   sustenance from the emotions of others, particularly those of pain and
   trauma. Though he enjoys playing his inner circle of assistants against
   each other as a sort of daily snack, Chalk's true nourishment comes
   from the dramas he orchestrates for his audience.

   Chalk's latest drama involves the pairing of Minner Burris, a space
   explorer who was captured and surgically altered by aliens on the
   planet Manipool, and Lona Kelvin, a 17-year-old girl who donated eggs
   for a fertility experiment that produced a hundred babies. Burris,
   whose freakish appearance draws attention whenever he ventures out in
   public, has withdrawn into seclusion and bitterness. Kelvin, whose
   brief fame as the virgin mother of an army of children has begun to
   fade, has twice attempted suicide because she has not been allowed to
   adopt or even see any of her offspring. Chalk promises Burris a full
   round of surgery and treatment to restore his human appearance, and
   offers Kelvin a chance to adopt one of her babies, if the two agree to
   come together for an all-expenses paid tour of the solar system.

   At first the two wounded subjects enjoy each other's company and even
   become lovers. Kelvin's empathy and compassion are stirred by Burris's
   plight, and Burris enjoys playing masculine protector and guide to the
   naive teenager. The affection soon curdles into irritation, hostility
   and even hatred--all of which provide a psychic feast for Chalk. The
   two finally break off after a particularly vicious fight, which Chalk
   uses as a pretext to void the agreement. He does, however, try to keep
   them on the hook by dangling new offers: for example, he asks Kelvin to
   befriend David Melangio, a childlike man whose feats of memory and
   calculation are his only means of meeting a world that has already
   subjected him to overwhelming traumas. Kelvin erupts in rage and is
   carried off by Chalk's assistants.

   Burris, meanwhile, has a sexual fling with Elise, the widow of an
   astronaut who accompanied Burris on the Manipool landing, and who died
   from the surgical alterations performed by the aliens. Elise is both
   aroused and repulsed by Burris' body, and the sadomasochistic nature of
   her attraction eventually alienates Burris. His withdrawal causes her
   to commit suicide in a particularly grisly fashion. Burris, deeply
   shaken, returns to Earth. He has realized that Chalk's promise was
   empty, and that such help may no longer even be possible--the changes
   wrought by the Manipool aliens appear irreversible. What's more, the
   surgery that turned him into a monster has also "improved" his body in
   unexpected ways that Burris has come to appreciate.

   With the inadvertent help of Melangio, who during a typically bland
   chat lets slip some information that gives them clues into Chalk's true
   nature, Kelvin and Burris confront the media baron in his office. They
   expose the full, unfiltered core of their mutual pain to Chalk, who is
   overwhelmed and finally killed by the intensity of the emotional flood.
   As the novel ends, Burris has convinced Kelvin to join him in a trip
   back to Manipool, where they will confront the aliens and, presumably,
   undergo alterations that take them beyond humanity.
