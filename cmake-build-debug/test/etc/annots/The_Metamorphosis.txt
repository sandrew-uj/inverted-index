   Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a
   "monstrous vermin". He initially considers the transformation to be
   temporary and slowly ponders the consequences of this metamorphosis.
   Stuck on his back and unable to get up and leave the bed, Gregor
   reflects on his job as a traveling salesman and cloth merchant, which
   he characterizes as being full of "temporary and constantly changing
   human relationships, which never come from the heart". He sees his
   employer as a despot, and would quickly quit his job if he were not his
   family's sole breadwinner and working off his bankrupt father's debts.
   While trying to move, Gregor finds that his office manager, the chief
   clerk, has shown up to check on him, indignant about Gregor's unexcused
   absence. Gregor attempts to communicate with both the manager and his
   family, but all they can hear from behind the door is incomprehensible
   vocalizations. Gregor laboriously drags himself across the floor and
   opens the door. The clerk, upon seeing the transformed Gregor, flees
   the apartment. Gregor's family is horrified, and his father drives him
   back into his room, injuring his side by shoving him when he gets stuck
   in the doorway.

   With Gregor's unexpected transformation, his family is deprived of
   their financial stability. They keep Gregor locked in his room, and he
   begins to accept his new identity and adapt to his new body. His sister
   Grete is the only one willing to bring him food, which they find Gregor
   only likes if it is rotten. He spends much of his time crawling around
   on the floor, walls, and ceiling and, upon discovering Gregor's new
   pastime, Grete decides to remove his furniture to give him more space.
   She and her mother begin to empty the room of everything except the
   sofa Gregor hides under whenever anyone comes in, but he finds their
   actions deeply distressing. He desperately tries to save a particularly
   loved portrait on the wall of a woman clad in fur. His mother loses
   consciousness at the sight of him clinging to the image to protect it.
   When Grete rushes out of the room to get some aromatic spirits, Gregor
   follows her and is slightly hurt when she drops a medicine bottle and
   it breaks. Their father returns home and angrily hurls apples at
   Gregor, one of which becomes lodged in a sensitive spot in his back and
   severely wounds him.

   Gregor suffers from his injuries for several weeks and takes very
   little food. His father, mother, and sister all get jobs and
   increasingly begin to neglect him, and his room begins to be used for
   storage. For a time, his family leaves Gregor's door open in the
   evenings so he can listen to them talk to each other, but this happens
   less frequently once they rent a room in the apartment to three male
   tenants, since the renters were not told about Gregor. One day, the
   charwoman, who briefly looks in on Gregor each day when she arrives and
   before she leaves, neglects to fully close his door. Attracted by
   Grete's violin-playing in the living room, Gregor crawls out and is
   spotted by the unsuspecting tenants, who complain about the apartment's
   unhygienic conditions and say they are leaving, will not pay anything
   for the time they have already stayed, and may take legal action.
   Grete, who has tired of taking care of Gregor and realizes the burden
   his existence puts on each member of the family, tells her parents they
   must get rid of "it" or they will all be ruined. Gregor, understanding
   that he is no longer wanted, laboriously makes his way back to his room
   and dies of starvation before sunrise. His body is discovered by the
   charwoman, who alerts his family and then disposes of the corpse. The
   relieved and optimistic father, mother, and sister all take the day off
   work. They ride a trolley out to the countryside and make plans to move
   to a smaller apartment to save money. During the short trip, Mr. and
   Mrs. Samsa realize that, in spite of the hardships that have brought
   some paleness to her face, Grete has grown up into a pretty and
   well-figured lady. They think about finding her a husband.
