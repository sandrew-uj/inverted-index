   At the end of The Mote in God's Eye, Renner and Bury are secretly
   enlisted into Imperial Naval Intelligence. Neither is happy about the
   arrangement at first, but they spend the next twenty-five years
   effectively preventing rebellions against the Empire so that the
   Imperial Navy can concentrate on blockading the Moties in their star
   system.

   While investigating suspicious economic activity on the planet Maxroy's
   Purchase, Renner and Bury encounter wide idiomatic usage of the phrase
   "...on the gripping hand". The source of the phrase turns out to be
   innocuous enough -- the governor picked up the expression as a crewman
   on INSS MacArthur on the expedition to Mote Prime -- but the memories
   dredged up are too much for Bury. Driven by nightmares and a
   deep-seated fear for humanity's safety, Bury must confirm that the
   Empire is safe from the Moties. Renner and Bury travel to Sparta, the
   Imperial capital planet, to obtain permission to inspect the blockade.

   In Mote, it is mentioned that a protostar is forming in the Coalsack
   Nebula. The Moties had studied it extensively and fooled Jacob Buckman,
   the astrophysicist on the only expedition to the Motie system, into
   believing that it would ignite in about 1,000 years. Bury and Renner
   discover, much to their horror, that the object is due to collapse and
   ignite much sooner. The newborn star will create one or more new
   Alderson Points for interstellar travel, giving the Moties another
   usable exit from their system. The sole currently existing Alderson
   Point leads to the photosphere of the supergiant red star Murcheson's
   Eye, which made the blockade much more practical.

   Armed with this alarming knowledge and carrying influential passengers,
   Renner and Bury depart aboard Bury's ship Sinbad for New Caledonia, the
   closest human system to the Mote. There the Imperial Commission decides
   that ships must be sent to the hitherto ignored star system where the
   only dangerous Alderson Point will appear. All that can be sent on such
   short notice are two Imperial warships and Sinbad.

   They arrive -- just in time to observe seven unarmed Motie ships emerge
   from the new Alderson Point. The Moties scatter, and three human ships
   cannot possibly capture all of them, though they can block the exit.
   Renner and Bury decide they have no choice but to accept a Mediator's
   invitation to return with her to the Motie system.

   The second half of The Gripping Hand is a tale of shifting alliances
   involving many Motie factions, diplomacy and space combat. With the aid
   of the grownup offspring of Lord and Lady Blaine, raised in the company
   of Mediators brought back by the first expedition, Bury and Renner
   fight to save the Empire. Key to their strategy is a genetically
   altered parasite developed by the Blaines' research institute. It
   limits the excessive reproduction rate that has condemned the Moties to
   Cycles of overpopulation, followed inevitably by war and the collapse
   of civilization. Two alliances coalesce, one in favor of peaceful
   co-existence with humans and another determined to escape the Motie
   system at any cost. The pro-human faction wins.
