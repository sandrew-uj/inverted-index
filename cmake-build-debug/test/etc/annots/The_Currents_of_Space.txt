   The story takes place in the context of Trantor's rise from a large
   regional power to a galaxy-wide empire, unifying millions of worlds.
   The approximate date is around the year 11,000 AD (originally 34,500
   AD, according to Asimov's early 1950s chronology), when the Trantorian
   Empire encompasses roughly half of the galaxy.

   The independent planet Sark rules, and exploits, the planet Florina
   which orbits the star located nearest to Sark's sun. Sark derives great
   wealth from kyrt, a natural plant fiber which is extraordinarily useful
   and versatile, but which cannot be grown on Sark or on any planet other
   than Florina. The relationship between the two planets is analogous to
   the situation between European imperial powers and their colonies
   during the 19th century: native Florinians are forced to work in kyrt
   fields and are treated as an inferior race by the resident Sarkites.
   They are also lighter-skinned than most humans on other worlds, but
   this is no longer viewed as significant. Memories of racism on Earth
   have been lost.

   Attempts to break the Sark monopoly and grow kyrt on worlds other than
   Florina have so far been unsuccessful, because kyrt plants grown on
   other planets do not produce kyrt, only a useless, inferior form of
   cellulose; no one understands why. So Sark's wealth depends on its
   colonial dominance of Florina. The government of Trantor naturally
   wishes to add the two worlds to its growing empire.

   The action centers around Rik, a man suffering from gross amnesia and
   apparent feeble-mindedness. When Rik gradually starts remembering his
   past, a political crisis involving Sark, Florina, and Trantor ensues.
   Rik must dodge planetary law-enforcement agents and interstellar spies
   as he attempts to learn his own history and identity, which the
   government of Sark is trying to prevent. Ultimately he learns that
   before losing his memory he was a "spacio-analyst": a specialized
   astronaut who gathers samples of the very sparse interstellar gasses in
   outer space, and determines their composition. (The spacio-analysts'
   slogan is "We analyze Nothing".) He also finds out that he had
   discovered that Florina's sun is about to explode into a nova because
   it is being exposed to a stream of isolated gaseous carbon atoms
   flowing through its region of space. The carbon atoms, besides causing
   Florina's sun to approach nova-stage, are also the reason kyrt grows on
   Florina: they are causing Florina's sun to emit a special energetic
   wavelength of light which kyrt plants need in order to bio-synthesize
   the kyrt fiber. Streams of carbon atoms ("carbon currents") are very
   rare in space; the reason the plants do not make kyrt when grown on
   planets orbiting other stars is that Florina is the only known
   habitable planet whose sun is located in the path of a carbon current.

   Because losing Florina would mean losing the principal source of Sark's
   vast wealth, there was strong resistance from the government of Sark to
   accept Rik's finding; his amnesia was caused by the government's misuse
   of a mind-altering device called a "psychic probe" in an attempt to
   suppress his message. However, once Rik recovers his memory and reveals
   the effect of the carbon atoms, the conditions that enable kyrt to grow
   can be easily duplicated anywhere now that they are understood.

   Rik also learns that he was born on the planet Earth, which is now
   radioactive. He suggests that Earth was the planet where humanity first
   originated, but this hypothesis remains controversial.
