   In some religions, the ruler, usually a king, was regarded as the
   chosen favorite of God (or gods) and could not be questioned, sometimes
   even being regarded as the descendant of or a god in their own right.
   Today, there is also a form of government where clerics have the power
   and the supreme leader could not be questioned in action. From the
   perspective of the theocratic government, "God himself is recognized as
   the head" of the state, hence the term theocracy, from the Koine
   Greek theokrati'a "rule of God", a term used by Josephus for the
   kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Taken literally, theocracy means rule
   by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal "rule of the heart",
   especially in its biblical application. The common, generic use of the
   term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous
   religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an
   ecclesiocracy.

   In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal
   connection with the civilization's religion or belief. For example,
   Moses led the Israelites, and Muhammad led the early Muslims. There is
   a fine line between the tendency of appointing religious characters to
   run the state and having a religious-based government. An
   ecclesiocracy, on the other hand, is a situation where the religious
   leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they
   are instruments of divine revelation. For example, the prince-bishops
   of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal
   ruler. Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the
   religion for its own administration, or it may have two "arms" -
   administrators and clergy - but with the state administrative hierarchy
   subordinate to the religious hierarchy. The papacy in the Papal States
   occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the
   pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God
   and translated it into civil law.

   Religiously endorsed monarchies fall between these two poles, according
   to the relative strengths of the religious and political organs.

   Theocracy is distinguished from other, secular forms of government that
   have a state religion, or are influenced by theological or moral
   concepts, and monarchies held "By the Grace of God". In the most common
   usage of the term, some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant
   religion (e.g., the Byzantine emperor as patron and defender of the
   official Church); the government proclaims it rules on behalf of God or
   a higher power, as specified by the local religion, and with divine
   approval of government institutions and laws. These characteristics
   apply also to a caesaropapist regime. The Byzantine Empire however was
   not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor, not vice
   versa; similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break
   away from Rome so the royal (and, especially later, parliamentary)
   power could assume full control of the now Anglican hierarchy and
   confiscate most church property and income.

   Secular governments can also co-exist with a state religion or delegate
   some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in
   Israel marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies
   who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet
   no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example)
   exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.
