   The book begins with two twelve-year-old girls, Zanna and Deeba, who
   have begun to notice several strange things happening around them, all
   of them centring on Zanna.

   After she and her friends are attacked by a dark cloud, Zanna spends
   the next two nights at Deeba's house. Deeba is awoken in the middle of
   the night by spies moving a broken umbrella. The girls follow it into
   the basement of a building, where they are drawn through a gap between
   the worlds of London and Un Lun Dun (or UnLondon).

   UnLondon is a nonsensical mirror version of London, inhabited by
   various creatures and animated items that have been discarded by the
   inhabitants on London. A boy named Hemi saves them from a roving pile
   of trash but is later shooed away by the tailor Obaday Fing who reveals
   that the boy is a ghost who was trying to get close enough to them to
   possess one of them. In conversation he realises that Zanna is the
   "Shwazzy," a prophesied chosen one who is destined to save UnLondon
   from the Smog - an evil, sentient cloud of pollution.

   With the help of Fing, Skool (a friend of Fing's in an old-fashioned
   diving suit), Conductor Jones, Rosa the bus driver, and the
   Slaterunners (a tribe of people who walk only on roofs), Zanna and
   Deeba make their way to the Propheseers where they learn more about the
   Smog. Apparently, after the Smog was created in London, a group of
   weatherwitches called the "Armets" battled it with a magic weapon
   called the "Klinneract." However, the Smog was not killed. Instead, it
   travelled to UnLondon. It is prophesied in The Book (a talking tome)
   that the Shwazzy would come one day and save UnLondon.

   But, in spite of what is prophesied, Zanna fails in her first battle
   against the Smog. Brokkenbroll, master of broken umbrellas (or
   unbrellas) arrives in time to shoo the Smog away using a new technique
   he and Benjamin Unstible (a Propheseer who was presumed dead) came up
   with. Zanna is severely injured and is sent home with Deeba with her
   memories of the city erased. Instead, the city turns to Brokkenbroll
   and Unstible who begin handing out Smog-resistant unbrellas to defend
   the people of UnLondon.

   However, Deeba, who still remembers UnLondon, begins to search for
   things related to it on the internet, hoping she can find someone to
   talk to. She discovers that Armets is really RMetS. This leads her to
   question everything she's learned. Upon further investigation she
   discovers that Unstible has been reported dead but that he had been
   studying the Clean Air Act. Just as UnLondoners misheard "RMetS" as
   "Armets," they misheard "Clean Air Act" as "Klinneract."

   She decides to travel back to UnLondon. After several tries, she
   finally finds a way back. She goes to Wraithtown, the town of ghosts.
   With the help of Hemi she verifies Unstible's death and sets out to
   warn the Propheseers. Unfortunately, on the way, Deeba and Hemi are
   taken to Brokkenbroll, who is revealed to be working with the Smog,
   which has re-animated Benjamin Unstible's body.

   They escape to warn the Propheseers, who refuse to listen to her. They
   run from them as well, escaping with The Book. The Book, although it
   has proved to be less-than-accurate, agrees to help them fulfil the
   Shwazzy's tasks and defeat the Smog in the limited time Deeba has
   before everyone in London forgets that she exists (this happens to
   everything that comes to UnLondon). Deeba and Hemi are aided in their
   quest by Obaday, Rosa, Jones; the utterlings Diss, Bling and Cauldron;
   and Yorick Cavea and Curdle the milk carton. They collect the UnGun, an
   ultimate weapon which can be loaded with anything. Deeba, under the
   banner of 'the Unchosen One', uses it to defeat the Smog and save
   UnLondon.
