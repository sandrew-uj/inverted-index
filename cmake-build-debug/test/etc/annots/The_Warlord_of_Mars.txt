   This novel continues where the previous one in the series, The Gods of
   Mars abruptly ended. At the end of the previous book, John Carter's
   wife, the princess Dejah Thoris, is imprisoned in the Temple of the Sun
   by the vile pretender goddess Issus. It is said one has to wait an
   entire Barsoomian year before the room the prisoner is in revolves back
   to the entrance.^[2]
