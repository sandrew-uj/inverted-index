   At Swim-Two-Birds presents itself as a first-person story by an unnamed
   Irish student of literature. The student believes that "one beginning
   and one ending for a book was a thing I did not agree with", and he
   accordingly sets three apparently quite separate stories in motion.
   The first concerns the Pooka MacPhellimey, "a member of the devil
   class". The second is about a young man named John Furriskey, who
   turns out to be a fictional character created by another of the
   student's creations, Dermot Trellis, a cynical writer of Westerns. The
   third consists of the student's adaptations of Irish legends, mostly
   concerning Finn Mac Cool and Mad King Sweeney.

   In the autobiographical frame story, the student recounts details of
   his life. He lives with his uncle, who works as a clerk in the Guinness
   Brewery in Dublin. The uncle is a complacent and self-consciously
   respectable bachelor who suspects that the student does very little
   studying. This seems to be the case, as by his own account the student
   spends more time drinking stout with his college friends, lying in bed,
   and working on his book than he does going to class.

   The stories that the student is writing soon become intertwined with
   each other. John Furriskey meets and befriends two of Trellis's other
   characters, Antony Lamont and Paul Shanahan. They each become resentful
   of Trellis's control over their destinies, and manage to drug him so
   that he will spend more time asleep, giving them the freedom to lead
   quiet domestic lives rather than be ruled by the lurid plots of his
   novels. Meanwhile, Trellis creates Sheila Lamont (Antony Lamont's
   sister) in order that Furriskey might seduce and betray her, but
   "blinded by her beauty" Trellis "so far forgets himself as to assault
   her himself." Sheila, in due course, gives birth to a child named
   Orlick, who is born as a polite and articulate young man with a gift
   for writing fiction. The entire group of Trellis's characters, by now
   including Finn, Sweeney, the urbane Pooka and an invisible and
   quarrelsome Good Fairy who lives in the Pooka's pocket, convenes in
   Trellis's fictional Red Swan Hotel where they devise a way to overthrow
   their author. Encouraged by the others, Orlick starts writing a novel
   about his father in which Trellis is tried by his own creations, found
   guilty and viciously tortured. Just as Orlick's novel is about to
   climax with Trellis' death, the college student passes his exams and
   reconciles with his uncle. He completes his story by having Trellis's
   maid accidentally burn the papers sustaining the existence of Furriskey
   and his friends, freeing Trellis.
