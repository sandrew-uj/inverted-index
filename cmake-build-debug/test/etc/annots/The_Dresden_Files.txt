   The Dresden Files is a series of contemporary fantasy/mystery novels
   written by American author Jim Butcher. The first novel, Storm Front,
   was published in 2000 by Roc Books.

   The books are written as a first-person narrative from the perspective
   of the main character, private investigator and wizard Harry Dresden,
   as he recounts investigations into supernatural disturbances in
   modern-day Chicago. Butcher's original proposed title for the first
   novel was Semiautomagic, which sums up the series' balance of fantasy
   and hard-boiled detective fiction.^[1]

   As of 2020, Butcher has written 17 novels set in the Dresden Files
   universe, plus a number of short stories (some of which are collected
   in the anthologies Side Jobs and Brief Cases). The series has also been
   released in audiobook format, narrated by James Marsters. Other works
   set in the same fictional universe include graphic novels (several new
   stories, plus adaptations of the first two novels), and The Dresden
   Files Roleplaying Game. In 2007, a television series based on the
   novels aired for one season on the American Sci-Fi Channel.^[2]
