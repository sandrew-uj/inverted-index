   The new Midnight Sons, Morbius, the Living Vampire, Werewolf by Night,
   Daimon Hellstrom, Jennifer Kale and the Man-Thing, each (except for
   Man-Thing) inoculated with a zombie virus vaccine created by Morbius,
   investigate a cruise ship being attacked by zombie Fishmen. As the Sons
   destroy the zombies, Morbius reveals that he has genetically engineered
   an oxidizing bacteria that causes the zombies to explode. The group
   kills them all only to confront zombie Piranha.

   Zombie Deadpool's head and Simon Garth are revealed to have been the
   cause of the new zombies by teleporting from A.R.M.O.R. headquarters
   during Marvel Zombies 3, entering the ocean floor, and having
   Deadpool's head infect all of the Men-Fish. Garth finds Black Talon and
   tells him about the zombie plague. Black Talon assumes control of Garth
   and captures Deadpool's head. Black Talon calls the Hood, offering the
   zombie plague as a weapon to destroy all superheroes.

   The cruise ship containing the zombified Men-Fish runs aground on
   Taino, home of Black Talon. Kale teleports the Midnight Sons to the
   island, as Hellstrom destroys the ship by igniting the engines.
   Meanwhile, the Hood confers with his cohorts as Dormammu mentally
   commands the Hood to get the virus. The Hood goes to the Black Talon's
   plantation on Taino, with the some of his henchmen. Dormammu warns the
   Hood that the Midnight Sons are approaching, so he sends the some of
   his men after the Sons. During a battle against some of zombie
   Deadpool's creations, Garth escapes with the head. Morbius attacks the
   zombies with his explosive vaccine, but it mutates into something
   deadlier, killing Hood's henchmen. Dormammu answers Kale's call for
   help by offering her great power.

   Jennifer rejects Dormammu and summons Man-Thing. The Hood, captured by
   The Midnight Sons, decides to side with them for help. Morbius' killer
   vaccine cloud begins to kill an entire village with rain. Simon and
   Zombie Deadpool walk through the killer rain as Man-Thing follows them
   healing the rain damage because of his Earth connection healing. Zombie
   Deadpool realizes he can control the vaccine cloud and creates a
   super-zombie out of dead bodies. After a fight, the "super-zombie"
   kills Man-Thing by lifting him off the ground and letting the rain
   destroy him. As Jennifer mourns his death and leaves Morbius, Hellstrom
   and The Hood, thinking of a way to escape as the Hood's henchmen,
   return zombified. Jack Russell confronts Kale, revealing that the
   vaccine has zombified him, which leaves Kale screaming Dormammu's name.
   As Morbius is about to call in a nuclear strike, Kale shows up,
   empowered with Dormammu's new gifts.

   After this, Kale attacks the Midnight Sons along with Hood's henchman
   zombies. Daimon exorcizes Kale's powers and she defeats the other
   zombies. She then uses her magic to make moonlight appear so Jack
   becomes his Werewolf form, which the zombie virus cannot affect.
   Morbius tells Black Talon that he and Kale need to combine their magic
   to contain the Zombie Plague cloud into a single host, Simon Garth. The
   Midnight Sons decide to fight other monsters now that the zombie plague
   is seemingly over.. but zombie Deadpool's head is floating in the sea
   still alive, until it resurfaces in Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth.
