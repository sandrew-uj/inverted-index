   Some time in the twenty-first century, humankind is extinct, leaving
   animals to fend for themselves. The once busy streets of Tokyo are now
   home to lions, tigers, chickens, and various other animals. All of them
   are now fighting for survival.
     * After running out of pet food, the Pomeranian now has to fend for
       itself in a now-wild-and-vicious Tokyo. The bosses he faces are fat
       cats although one is fought by his children. He ends his story
       establishing a small pack of Pomeranians.
     * Two Sika deer fawns search the hostile streets of Tokyo, looking
       for their mother. The fawns are separated briefly, and their
       reunion is short-lived, with one of the two being killed by a
       Cheetah, leaving the other to continue the search. His/her story
       ends with a series of cold trails leading to a dead end.
     * A hungry Beagle tries to overthrow a tyrannical Tosa Inu. The
       Beagle builds an army out of his pups to fight the Tosa. The boss
       he faces is the Tosa himself. The Beagle is killed by The Hyena.
     * The Tosa Inu is injured by the Beagle, and must escape. He then
       works to regain his lost honor. The Tosa is trained by a bear to
       fight better, and confronts the entire army of the Nomad Pack, and
       manages to kill them all. He duels the leader of the pack, The
       Hyena, and kills him. His story ends with him retaking his
       position, and is implied to have become a leader rather than a
       tyrant. The boss he faces is in one stage a chimpanzee, a
       crocodile, a tiger and in his final stage two giant hyenas, a
       Smilodon and the same hyena that overthrew his master.
     * The lioness and her hunting party have to hunt the targeted animals
       all over the Subway area. The boss she faces is a kangaroo with
       four rabbit sidekicks. She ends her story going back to her family
       after hunting.
     * The male Lion has to defend his pride from the roving male lions.
       The boss he faces are four hyenas and another lion. His story ends
       with him defeating the pack, allowing his family to live in peace.
     * The hyenas are planning to deal with the beagle. The Hyena kills
       The Beagle, and takes over his territory. The boss he faces is the
       Beagle himself. His story ends with him fighting the Nomad Lion for
       control of the pack, with the Tosa's story picking up almost
       immediately after, where it is discovered he killed the Lion, and
       runs away from the Tosa, who is trying to kill him. The Tosa
       catches up to him and fights him, and prevails, with The Hyena
       dying after one last attempt to kill his rival.
     * ERC-003 is a robotic dog resembling a Sony AIBO Codenamed "Lily".
       After being found by ERC-X with its family of two wolves, ERC-003
       now has to scan all of Tokyo for the disaster signals being put out
       by the humans' underground facility. It then faces a moral choice
       of whether to bring humanity back to Tokyo, or let the animals
       rule. Choosing yes will end the game, whereas 'no' will trigger a
       series of final boss fights and what is considered to be the "true
       ending". The first boss it faces is the Tosa just as the Beagle's
       was. Unless it decided to bring the humans back, the bosses it
       faces are its former ERC-X pal, two Deinonychus, two Smilodons and
       the final boss, the upgraded ERC X named ERC X 2. It either lives
       with the future humans, or dies from its wounds during a fight
       saving the animals from being exterminated by the humans.
