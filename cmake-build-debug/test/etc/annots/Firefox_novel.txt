   During the Cold War, British and American intelligence services learn
   of the MiG-31 aircraft developed by the Soviet Union. The plane (given
   the NATO code name "Firefox") embodies a number of technology advances
   - including stealth technology, hypersonic flight above Mach 5 and a
   thought-guided weapons system - dramatically surpassing those of the
   West.

   Faced with an aircraft which will give the Soviet Union the ability to
   completely dominate the skies, the CIA and MI6 launch a joint mission
   to steal one of the two Firefox prototype aircraft. Their plan involves
   using veteran US Air Force fighter pilot Mitchell Gant, who travels to
   the Soviet Union under an assumed identity. On paper, Gant is ideally
   trained to steal Firefox, being fluent in Russian and having already
   flown captured Soviet planes. Overlooked by his superiors is Gant's
   wartime experiences in Vietnam, including his capture by Viet Cong
   after being shot down, an ordeal exacerbated when the enemy guerrillas
   are wiped out almost immediately by napalm from an American air strike.

   With the help of a network of dissidents and sympathizers, Gant reaches
   Bilyarsk air base where the two prototype aircraft are being developed.
   Jewish dissident scientists, forced to work on the project, help Gant
   penetrate the base, then start a fire to destroy the second prototype
   and also to distract security troops while Gant steals one of the
   planes. Having escaped with the plane, Gant first heads east to the
   Ural Mountains, then turns south toward Turkey. The Soviets reason that
   Gant must escape north to the Arctic Circle or south to Turkey, a NATO
   member. The plane lacks fuel to reach China, and even with stealth
   capability would never risk the dense Moscow defences to the west. Gant
   intentionally encounters an Aeroflot jetliner, then vanishes north,
   hoping to mislead his pursuers. As a result, the Soviets concentrate
   their search to the south.

   Gant hugs the eastern slopes of the Ural Mountains to evade Soviet
   acoustical listening stations, but is spotted and fired upon by a SAM
   station equipped with infrared search and track sensors. Gant decoys
   the incoming infrared homing missiles by destroying a Badger aircraft
   that chances upon the scene. Gant escapes, but the Soviets are now
   alerted to his heading and redirect their search efforts to the Barents
   Sea area of the Arctic. A Soviet missile cruiser spots Gant and
   attacks, firing missiles and attempting to launch a helicopter. Gant
   destroys the helicopter, but he is now nearly out of fuel so he climbs
   to stretch out his range. His receiver then detects the homing signal,
   directing Gant to an ice floe. Landing, Gant finds an American
   submarine bearing kerosene fuel and using the floe as an ad-hoc runway.
   The Americans rearm and refuel the Firefox, giving Gant the necessary
   range, but barely finish before the arrival of a Soviet submarine.

   Thinking that he has made good his escape, Gant finds himself under
   attack by the second Firefox prototype. Realizing that the Soviet
   scientists failed to destroy the second plane, Gant is forced to
   dogfight. The second MiG is flown by Firefox test-pilot Tretsov, who is
   more experienced in the Firefox aircraft and consistently outflies
   Gant. Nevertheless, after desperate manoeuvrers, Gant realises that the
   second plane has been destroyed - during the dogfight he reflexively
   ordered the thought-controlled weapons system to eject a decoy flare,
   which was immediately ingested by the second MiG's jet intake,
   triggering an internal explosion that destroyed it. Free of pursuit,
   Gant continues on his journey.
