   The nameless narrator lives in an isolated tin house situated on a
   windswept sandy plain, miles from his nearest neighbours whom he meets
   infrequently. He is quite happy in his lonely self-sufficiency until
   unexpectedly a woman, Mary Petrie, comes to live with him. Unsettled at
   first, the narrator gradually gets used to the companionship. Then news
   comes of a new community being established on the edge of the plain by
   a charismatic, yet enigmatic figure who is digging a canyon and gaining
   more and more followers to his revolutionary cause. One by one, his
   neighbours join the canyon project, moving their tin houses to the new
   community as the narrator feels under increasing pressure to join them.
   It transpires that the end-goal for the project is not for there to be
   a city of tin houses, but a city of clay houses. Many of the previously
   convinced citizens of the plain and beyond are frustrated by this news,
   and decide to return to their previous existences.
