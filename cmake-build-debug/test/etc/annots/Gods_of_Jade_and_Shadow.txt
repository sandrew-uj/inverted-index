   The story is set in the late 1920s as Mexico emerges from its
   revolutionary era into the Jazz Age. After her father dies, Casiopea
   Tun and her mother move back to their native Mayan town of Uukumil in
   the Yucatan, where she grows up as an unwanted poor relation in her
   wealthy grandfather's house. She is especially tormented by her
   spoiled, bitter cousin Martin Leyva. At eighteen, Casiopea works as a
   servant for her grandfather, dreaming of escape.

   In a forbidden chest in her grandfather's bedroom, she discovers the
   bones of the Mayan death god Hun-Kame. A shard of bone pierces her
   thumb, restoring Hun-Kame to a semblance of life. Bound to Casiopea,
   the god enlists her in his quest to regain his missing body parts,
   which his twin brother and rival Vucub-Kame has scattered throughout
   Mexico and left in the keeping of sorcerers, demons, and other
   supernatural entities. Once he is whole, he hopes to retake rulership
   of Xibalba, the Mayan underworld, from which he has been deposed by his
   brother.

   Their journey takes them throughout Mexico, from Yucatan to Veracruz,
   Mexico City, El Paso, and Baja California. Their parasitic relationship
   powers their quest, as Casiopea sacrifices more and more of her
   vitality to Hun-Kame, and he in turn takes on more and more of the
   attributes of mortality. As Hun-Kame becomes increasingly mortal, he
   and Casiopea start to fall in love with each other, even though both of
   them know they cannot be together. Throughout their journey, they must
   deal with the machinations of the god's brother and his inhuman and
   human allies, particularly Casiopea's cousin Martin, who serves
   Vucub-Kame much as she does Hun-Kame.

   The root of the gods' rivalry lies in Vucub-Kame's lust to restore the
   bloody sacrifices and glories of Mayan and Aztec times, which Hun-Kame
   is content to leave in the past. Their rivalry ends with both their
   mortal proxies consigned to Xibalba for a deceptively simple contest:
   walking the Black Road to the Jade Palace, with the lives of the twin
   death gods and the fate of the world as the stakes. The one who reaches
   the palace first wins, but to stray from the road means suffering k'up
   kaal, the ritual beheading to slake the blood-thirst of the underworld
   pantheon.

   Initially struggling, Casiopea faces the many tricks and enemies that
   lie upon the Black Road. Once she evades Kamazotz, a giant bat, she
   gains some confidence and begins to catch up to Martin. However, Martin
   reaches the foot of the Jade Palace before she even reaches the
   outskirts of the Black City. Casiopea realizes that there is no way to
   win the contest, so she declares her allegiance to Hun-Kame and slits
   her throat. Her sacrifice is acknowledged as a victory by both Hun-Kame
   and Vucub-Kame. Now the rightful ruler of Xibalba, Hun-Kame restores
   Casiopea to life and, inspired by Casiopea's selflessness, forgives his
   brother instead of punishing him. Casiopea and Martin are returned to
   the mortal realm, where Martin decides to prolong his absence from
   Uukumil. Now alone and unsure of her future, Casiopea reunites with
   Loray, a demon who aided her and Hun-Kame earlier in their journey.
   Together they embark on a new adventure with Casiopea fulfilling her
   long-time dream of learning to drive.
