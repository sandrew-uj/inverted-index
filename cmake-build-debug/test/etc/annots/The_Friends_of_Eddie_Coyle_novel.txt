   Eddie Coyle is an aging, low-level gunrunner for a crime organization
   in Boston, Massachusetts. He is awaiting sentencing after being
   convicted of driving a hijacked truck in New Hampshire. Eddie had been
   driving the truck for Dillon, a convicted felon and career criminal who
   is well connected to the syndicate. Coyle has refused to give Dillon up
   to the authorities in exchange for leniency. Coyle's last chance to
   avoid a prison term is a sentencing recommendation from ATF Special
   Agent Dave Foley, who demands that Coyle become an informer in return.

   A gang led by Jimmy Scalisi and Artie Van has been pulling off a series
   of daring day-time bank robberies with pistols supplied by Coyle. One
   of Coyle's sources for the pistols is a young gun runner, Jackie Brown,
   who is involved in a deal to supply military machine guns (M16 assault
   rifles) for other clients. When taking the delivery of the pistols,
   Coyle witnesses the rifles in the trunk of Jackie Brown's car and
   immediately informs Foley. Jackie is apprehended by Foley and his
   agents. Coyle feels he has fulfilled his end of the deal, but Foley
   puts the squeeze on Eddie, demanding more information for his
   cooperation.

   Angry at his mis-treatment of her, Scalisi's girlfriend Wanda tips off
   the police about the next planned bank robbery, leading the state
   police to arrest Scalisi and Van's gang in the commission of the
   robbery. During the arrests, the police shoot and kill a young member
   of the gang who is well-connected (and possibly related) to the head of
   a powerful crime family.

   That same morning, with both men unaware that the bank robbers have
   been arrested, Coyle suggests that he may be willing to give Foley the
   names of the bank robbers in exchange for his slate being wiped clean
   in New Hampshire. Foley agrees to meet Coyle later in the day, with the
   understanding that if Coyle doesn't show, he opted not to rat on the
   bank robbers.

   The head of the crime family mistakenly believes it was Coyle who
   informed on Scalisi and Van's gang. The boss, referred to only as "the
   man," is furious because the state police killed his friend, who was
   part of the gang, during the arrest. The man hires Dillon to kill
   Coyle, who begrudgingly takes the contract.

   We learn from Foley that Coyle never showed, and thus did not inform.
   After waiting for Coyle, Foley buys a paper and sees that the
   information has become useless anyhow, as the robbers have been
   arrested. Later that afternoon, Coyle enters Dillon's bar in a sour
   mood, knowing he'll have to serve time in prison. Dillon receives a
   call confirming the plan to kill Coyle, and subsequently invites him to
   the Bruins game that evening. At the game, Dillon plies Coyle with
   liquor and eventually shoots him while an accomplice drives the men
   after the game. They leave Coyle's body in a car in the West End
   Bowling Alleys parking lot.

   In the final chapter, Jackie Brown is in court being arraigned for
   possession of machine guns. After pleading not guilty, a trial date is
   set. The prosecutor and defense counsel discuss options, but both show
   resignation that whatever happens to Jackie Brown, nothing will change
   in the world of crime.
