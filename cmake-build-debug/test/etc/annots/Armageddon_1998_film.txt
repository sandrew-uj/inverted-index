   A massive meteor shower destroys the orbiting Space Shuttle Atlantis,
   before entering the atmosphere and bombarding New York City. NASA
   discovers that the meteors were pushed out of the asteroid belt by a
   rogue comet that jarred loose a Texas-sized asteroid that will impact
   Earth in 18 days, which would cause an extinction level event that will
   wipe out all life on the planet. NASA scientists plan to drill a deep
   shaft into the asteroid and plant a nuclear weapon which, when
   detonated, will split the asteroid into two-halves that will fly safely
   past Earth. NASA contacts Harry Stamper, considered the best deep sea
   oil driller in the world, for assistance. Harry departs for Houston
   with his daughter Grace, where Harry agrees to participate in the
   mission, explaining that he will need his team: Chick, Rockhound, Max,
   Oscar, Bear, Noonan, and A.J., Grace's lover, to whom Grace gets
   engaged shortly before the mission. They also agree to help once their
   unusual list of demands is met.

   As NASA puts Harry and his crew through 12 days of rigorous astronaut
   training at the Johnson Space Center, Harry and his team re-outfit the
   mobile drillers, named "Armadillos", which they will use on the
   asteroid. NASA is forced to reveal their plans to the world when a
   piece of the asteroid wipes out part of Shanghai. Two advanced Space
   Shuttles, Freedom and Independence, are launched from the Kennedy Space
   Center in Florida. Once in orbit the shuttles dock with the Russian
   space station Mir manned by Lev Andropov to refuel. However, a fuel
   pipe leaks into electrical components causing a fire to break out
   during the fuel transfer and the station is evacuated, but in the
   haste, Lev and AJ are trapped in the fuel pod area. They manage to
   escape through a vent before and narrowly make it to shuttle
   Independence before the station explodes. Sixty hours later the
   shuttles slingshot around the far side of the Moon to land on the rear
   of the asteroid. As they travel through the asteroid's debris field,
   Independence's hull is punctured and it crashes, with most of its crew
   killed. Grace, watching from Mission Control, is distraught by A.J.'s
   apparent death.

   Freedom lands safely, but misses the target area by 26 miles (42 km),
   meaning the team must now drill through a thicker crust of compressed
   iron ferrite. When they fall behind schedule and communications
   threaten to fail, the President orders the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
   of Staff, General Kimsey to initiate "Secondary Protocol"; to remotely
   detonate the weapon on the asteroid's surface. Knowing this would be
   ineffective, NASA executive Dan Truman and his team delay General
   Kimsey and the military at Mission Control, while Harry persuades the
   shuttle commander Colonel Sharp to disarm the bomb so they can complete
   the drilling. After the mission is resumed, the Freedom Armadillo
   strikes a methane gas pocket and is blown into space, killing Max. With
   the mission presumed lost, worldwide panic ensues and martial law is
   declared in many countries, just before another meteorite destroys
   Paris. A.J., Lev, and Bear, having survived the Independence crash,
   arrive in Independence's Armadillo in time to complete the drilling.

   As the asteroid approaches Earth, the surviving crew is struck by a
   rock storm, which kills Gruber and damages the bomb's remote trigger,
   meaning someone must stay behind to detonate it manually. The
   non-flight crew draw straws and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit
   the airlock, Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside,
   telling him he is the son he never had and would be proud to have him
   marry Grace. Before preparing to detonate the bomb, Harry contacts
   Grace to say his last goodbyes. Freedom moves to a safe distance and
   Harry pushes the button at the last second, successfully detonating the
   nuclear weapon and splitting the asteroid in two at the cost of his own
   life. Both halves safely fly past Earth. Freedom lands, and the
   surviving crew return as heroes. Sometime later A.J. and Grace are
   married, with portraits of Harry and the other lost crew members
   present in memoriam.
