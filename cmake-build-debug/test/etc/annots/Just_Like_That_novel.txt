   Edek Zepler is a Holocaust survivor who was born Edek Zeleznikow in
   L/odz, Poland in 1915, where his father owned several apartment blocks.
   He got married in the L/odz ghetto to Rooshka but had to marry her
   again after the war in a DP Camp in Germany. That is where their
   daughter, Esther, was born in 1950. In 1951 the family emigrated to
   Melbourne, Australia. When the novel opens, Edek Zepler is an old man
   of 76 who certainly enjoys good food, a man living alone with his dog
   in the old house in Melbourne, feeling rather alone--in spite of an
   active Jewish community in his neighbourhood--and without any life in
   him since his wife's death in 1986 ("The saddest thing did already
   happen to me. My wife died. Nothing can be sad after that."). He
   regularly phones his family, who have moved to Manhattan. The only
   close relative still in Melbourne is his grandson, Zachary, who studies
   medicine there.

   His life takes a decisive turn when, on a visit to New York, he meets
   Josl and Henia Borenstein again, a couple he last saw in the German DP
   camp. Now that Josl Borenstein has died of cancer, Edek and Henia
   gradually feel more and more attracted to each other. In spite of
   several (alleged) proposals of marriage from millionaires, Henia,
   herself a rich widow, wants to spend the rest of her life with Edek and
   invites him to stay with her at her Florida home. Eventually, Edek
   packs up all his things, sells his house and moves to the U.S.A. He is
   cordially taken up by Henia's friends, who belong to several
   associations (for example the Zionist Federation). Although mostly
   agnostic, he even pays an occasional visit to the synagogue.

   The problem he has to face towards the end of the novel would be
   considered rather severe by the average person, but Edek Zepler just
   laughs it off: Henia's two sons want him to sign a pre-nuptial
   agreement so that he would not inherit anything if Henia died first
   (and so that he would not be able to bequeath the Borenstein fortune to
   Esther and his grandchildren). Such an agreement, Esther and her
   husband Sean warn him, might mean that he could be left even without a
   place to stay after her death. But Edek Zepler does not mind ("In that
   case, I'll come and live with you."). He signs everything and is
   married to Henia.

   Esther Zepler is the only child of Edek and Rooshka Zepler. She was
   born in a German DP camp in 1950. In 1951 her parents decided to
   emigrate to Australia, where she spent most of her life. In 1968, aged
   18, she became a rock journalist - just like Lily Brett herself - and
   in this capacity also visited New York. As a young woman, she married a
   gentile and had a son, Zachary, now 21, and a daughter, Zelda, now 16,
   by him. However, her first marriage was characterized by a "lack of
   lust", and when she met Sean Ward, a painter and yet another gentile,
   she left her husband for him. Nobody would guess that Sean, Esther,
   Zachary, Zelda and Kate - Sean's 19-year-old daughter by his first
   wife, who died of cancer - are a patchwork family. For one thing, Sean
   looks Jewish although he is not; for another, they all understand each
   other well and there is a certain feeling of belonging amongst them.
   When the novel opens they have just moved to New York City, and Esther
   starts working as a writer of obituaries.

   Although on the surface level Esther's life seems to be in perfect
   order - she has got a good job, she is happily married, her children
   are well-behaved, they all are quite wealthy, they do not suffer from
   any illnesses - Esther is constantly suffering in some way or other.
   She has always seen herself as "a person with so much to sort out", and
   this is why she has been in analysis for a quite a number of years. She
   spends a fortune on it and even has to sell her mother's diamond ring.
   At one point in the novel, she learns the difference between compulsive
   and obsessive behaviour (compulsive behaviour is to do with action,
   obsessive behaviour with thoughts) and promptly thinks she herself
   shows both types of behaviour. She suffers from agoraphobia as well as
   claustrophobia. When she was 15, back home in Australia, her father let
   her drive his car in public until they were stopped by the police. Now,
   as an adult, she is afraid to drive, and considers herself lucky that
   you do not really need a car in New York City. She is neurotic, a woman
   with "excessive anxieties and indecisions", and likely to panic when
   having to face things. She is all for drugs: beta blocker, Valium,
   Mylanta, and other pills. On the other hand, Esther neither smokes nor
   drinks.

   Generally, although she likes, and is able to enjoy, sex, she is very
   reluctant to talk about it, especially in public. But all around her,
   people keep talking freely about sex in general and also about their
   own sex lives, whereas Esther does not even want to imagine her father
   sleeping with Henia Borenstein, and is slightly embarrassed when she
   sees them holding hands under the table.

   Esther often feels "fouled by her parents' past". She is haunted by her
   dead mother. She is preoccupied with the Holocaust and owns more than
   400 books on the subject. Her thoughts about the lives of Jews during
   the Third Reich are again and again woven into the novel. She ponders
   about medical experiments conducted by Nazi physicians; about the gas
   chambers in the death camps, implicitly comparing a crowded New York
   subway with a cattle wagon to Auschwitz; the Nazis making soap with
   human fat; Pope Pius XII and Roman Catholicism; displaced Jews after
   World War II; anti-Semitism in general; Neo-Nazis in Germany and
   Austria; the world population of Jews in 1939 and today and the fact
   that there were "no Jews left" in Poland after World War II; business
   in the DP camps (i.e. bartering with cigarettes), coffee but also Nazi
   memorabilia; and she considers with disgust a video game on CD-ROM
   entitled "How to Survive the Holocaust".

   She is also preoccupied with death and dying on a more general level.
   For example, she reads a book on suicide, which she finds invigorating
   rather than depressing. Fear of death seems to be her constant
   companion; she continuously sees death as a danger and a menace. Esther
   also seems to have inherited her mother's "guilt at having survived".
   At one point in the novel, she speaks of a Jewish "weariness gene".

   But Esther is also critical of the other Jews she meets in America.
   There is Sonia Kaufman, who considers Esther as her best friend. Sonia
   is a lawyer working for the same law firm as her Jewish husband
   Michael. As opposed to Esther, Sonia has had affairs throughout her
   married life. Her current lover used a broken condom while they were
   making love, and now Sonia is pregnant for the first time in her life.
   As it turns out soon, she is expecting twins. The real problem now is
   that she cannot possibly say who the father is. Sonia hopes that they
   will look like her husband, who is looking forward to the birth of his
   children and has no idea that his wife has had sex with another man.
   The problem is solved in rather a humorous, light-hearted way at the
   end of the novel: The twins - two girls - look like her mother. The
   Kaufmans will be able to afford two nannies, so they will not have any
   problems combining their careers and their family life.

   Then there are Joseph and Laraine Reiser. The Reisers are "arseholes".
   They are filthy rich Jews who live the life of the super-rich in a very
   pronounced way, never mingling with ordinary people, on whom they seem
   to look down. Joseph Reiser is an entrepreneur "doing business with
   Germany"--in itself a suspicious activity--and a would be-patron of the
   arts: Time and again he talks to Sean Ward about coming to his studio,
   implying that he might want to buy one of his paintings, but he never
   seems to get round to doing so. Sean and Esther meet them twice: first,
   at one of their big parties, and later when they are invited to their
   Long Island beach house. Esther feels guilty when one of the Reisers'
   cars (a stretch Mercedes limo with a fax machine) comes to pick them
   up.
