          (The following summary is based on the 2002 rewrite.)

   In a rundown apartment in New Jersey, Morgan Le Fay has finally decided
   to end her own life. Although kept immortal by magic, she has become
   apathetic, elderly, and corpulent, and sees no point in continuing with
   her life. Before cutting her wrist with a steak knife, she decides to
   look in on her old nemesis, Merlin's prison, one last time, and is
   surprised to see that he has escaped. Given a reason to live again, she
   laughs triumphantly.

   In Manhattan, King Arthur appears on the streets in full medieval
   armor, which he quickly divests in favor of a tailored suit (thanks to
   an American Express card that appears in his pocket by magic). He then
   walks into Central Park, where the Lady of the Lake rises from the pond
   and gives him Excalibur.

   Setting up an office under the name "Arthur Penn" (short for
   Pendragon), Arthur reunites with Merlin, who advises him that the world
   needs a leader like him, so Arthur decides to enter politics, beginning
   with announcing his candidacy for Mayor of New York City. As he is
   setting up his campaign headquarters, he hires the first applicant for
   an executive secretary, Gwen DeVere Queen, despite Merlin's
   disapproval. Arthur also "acquires," as hangers-on, two petty thugs,
   Buddy and Elvis, who crossed his path in Central Park and became awed
   by him.

   After collecting the requisite number of signatures to run as an
   independent candidate, Arthur begins his campaign with impromptu
   speeches on street corners in New York, where his medieval, yet
   chivalric views fascinate random passers-by. His campaign alarms his
   illegitimate son Modred, who is immortal thanks to his mother Morgan's
   sorcery, but now works as a campaign manager for the Republican mayoral
   candidate.
