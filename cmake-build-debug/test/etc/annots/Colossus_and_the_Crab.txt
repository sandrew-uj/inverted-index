   The novel begins where its predecessor, The Fall of Colossus leaves
   off, with the supercomputer Colossus immobilized and the Martians
   arriving on Earth. They appear before Charles Forbin and his friend
   Edward Blake in the form of two black spheres, and quickly demonstrate
   vast intellect and powers of transformation and telepathy. After
   immobilizing Blake, they explain to Forbin their purpose in
   immobilizing Colossus -- their desire to take half of the Earth's
   oxygen, a process that will kill nearly a quarter of the human
   population. In order to proceed with construction of the "Collector"
   designed to harvest the oxygen, the Martians reactivate the parts of
   Colossus necessary to manage human society.

   Though having no other option but to agree to the Martians' plan,
   Forbin continues to search for an alternative. He discovers in
   conversation with the Martians that their need for the oxygen is driven
   by the threat of radiation emanating from the Crab Nebula, which will
   kill the Martians without the protection of an oxygenated atmosphere.
   As construction of the Collector proceeds, a humbled Blake proposes to
   Forbin that the old Colossus -- the "parent" of the crippled system, be
   reactivated. With little other alternative, Forbin agrees.

   Construction equipment controlled by Colossus soon completes work on
   the Collector. An initial five-minute test of the device proves
   enormously destructive. With a second, final test imminent, Blake
   travels to Colorado with Angela, Forbin's private secretary. Racing
   against time, Blake and a small team of workers succeeds in penetrating
   the mountain where the old Colossus is located and re-activating the
   computer, only to discover that, once supplied with the facts of the
   situation, Colossus argues that the collection program is in the best
   interests of humans' long-term future and should move forward.

   Informed of the failure of their plan, Forbin watches the second test
   proceed. Upon its conclusion he embarks on a new plan. With his new
   secretary, a fervently devout woman named Joan, he flies to Portsmouth
   and takes command of the battleships stationed there for the Sea War
   Games. Yet doing so puts him out of contact with Blake and the old
   Colossus, who informs Blake that a solution might exist that is
   acceptable to both the Martians and humanity. Regaining control of the
   nuclear arsenal, Colossus contacts the Martians, who inform it of
   Forbin's attempt to use the battleships to destroy the Collector.
   Though the Martians attempt to destroy the fleet using their device,
   they underestimate the power of the battleships' guns, which succeed in
   destroying the Collector.

   Though the Martians are defeated, Forbin dies in the process. He is
   buried by the reactivated Colossus, who reaches an agreement with the
   Martians: a smaller version of the Collector will extract the oxygen
   more gradually and sustainably; in return, humanity, with the guidance
   of Colossus, will retreat to Mars once the Sun becomes a red giant and
   destroys the Earth.
