   The Doctor collapses outside his TARDIS and is taken to Ashbridge
   Cottage Hospital in Epping, where his unusual anatomy confounds
   doctors.

   Meanwhile, a meteorite shower falls on the English countryside, and a
   poacher discovers a mysterious plastic polyhedron at the crash site.
   Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart of UNIT is trying to recruit Dr. Elizabeth
   "Liz" Shaw as a scientific advisor to examine any meteorites for
   evidence of aliens. Shaw is sceptical of the Brigadier's concerns and
   resents being taken away from her research at Cambridge.

   The plastic polyhedron is a power unit for a non-physical alien
   intelligence known as the Nestene Consciousness. Normally disembodied,
   it has an affinity for plastic, and is able to animate human replicas
   made from it, called Autons. The Nestene have taken over a toy factory
   in Epping, and plan to replace key government and public figures with
   Auton duplicates. The Auton in charge of the factory sends other, less
   human-looking, dummy-like Autons to retrieve the power units from UNIT
   and the poacher.

   After recovering in hospital and avoiding being kidnapped by the
   Autons, the Doctor discovers that his TARDIS has been disabled by the
   Time Lords and he is trapped on Earth. Despite his recent change in
   appearance, he convinces Lethbridge-Stewart that he is the same man who
   helped to defeat the Yeti and the Cybermen. Together with Liz, he
   uncovers the Nestene plot, just as the Autons activate across Britain
   and begin killing. The Doctor assembles an electroshock device that he
   believes will disable them.

   UNIT attacks the plastics factory, but the Autons are impervious to
   gunfire. The Doctor and Liz make their way inside and encounter a
   tentacled plastic host created by the Nestenes as the perfect form for
   the invasion. While the Doctor struggles with the creature, Liz uses
   the electroshock device to shut the creature down, the effect cascading
   to all other Autons.

   The Brigadier fears the Nestenes will return and asks for the Doctor's
   continued help. The Doctor agrees, albeit reluctantly, to join UNIT. In
   return, he requires facilities to help repair the TARDIS, and a car
   like the sporty antique roadster he commandeered during the adventure.
   At his insistence, Liz also stays on as his assistant.
