   The Vorkosigan Saga is a series of science fiction novels and short
   stories set in a common fictional universe by American author Lois
   McMaster Bujold.^[1] The first of these was published in 1986 and the
   most recent in May 2018. Works in the series have received numerous
   awards and nominations, including five Hugo award wins including one
   for Best Series.

   The point of view characters include women (Cordelia in Shards of Honor
   and Barrayar; Ekaterin in Komarr, A Civil Campaign, and The Flowers of
   Vashnoi), a gay man (Ethan of Athos), a pair of brothers, one of whom
   is physically handicapped and the other a clone (Miles and Mark
   Vorkosigan), and their cousin (Ivan Vorpatril), together with some
   minor characters (e.g., Miles' bodyguard Roic and the runaway lad Jin).

   The various forms of society and government Bujold presents often
   reflect contemporary politics. In many novels, there is a contrast
   between the technology-rich egalitarian Beta Colony (or more generally,
   galactic society) and the heroic, militaristic, hierarchical society of
   Barrayar, where personal relationships must ensure societal continuity.
   Miles Vorkosigan, the protagonist of most of the series, is the son of
   a Betan mother and a Barrayaran aristocrat.
