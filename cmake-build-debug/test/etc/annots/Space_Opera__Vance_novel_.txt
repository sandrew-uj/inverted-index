   On Earth, audiences are entranced by the musical entertainments staged
   by an alien troupe, the Ninth Company of the planet Rlaru. Dame Isabel
   Grayce (one of a long line of formidable society matrons in Vance's
   works) has sponsored the entertainments; when the Ninth Company
   disappears without a trace, she proposes to recoup her losses and bring
   culture to the wastes of space by forming an opera company which Adolph
   Gondar (the discoverer of Rlaru) will pilot on a tour of suitable
   planets, with Rlaru as ultimate destination. Singers, orchestra, a
   British conductor (Sir Henry Rixon) are engaged; an argumentative
   critic, Bernard Bickel, who thinks the Ninth Company were fakes, is
   hired as musical consultant. Dame Isabel's indolent and aptly named
   nephew Roger Wool (one of a long line of Vancian put-upon nephews) tags
   along also, smuggling his new girlfriend Madoc Roswyn, who claims to be
   a simple girl from Merioneth in Wales, aboard the ship as a stowaway.

   Like many of Vance's works, the novel is a picaresque; Gondar has his
   own reasons for not returning to Rlaru, and diverts the company half
   way round the galaxy, with various adventures or humiliations occurring
   on the different planets they touch down on. (There are some
   similarities with Vance's later novel Showboat World, which has a
   travelling company presenting performances of Shakespeare's Macbeth to
   generally uncomprehending audiences along an immense river on a distant
   planet.) Over the course of the voyage, the company stages several
   celebrated works, such as Beethoven's Fidelio, Mozart's The Magic Flute
   and Cos`i fan tutte, Rossini's The Barber of Seville and Wagner's
   Tristan und Isolde and Flying Dutchman. These are performed before
   various human or non-human audiences, the libretti and costumes
   sometimes having to be adapted to become understandable to alien
   cultures. On the whole, due to such cultural disparities, their
   reception is far from that expected by Dame Isabel: on a penal colony
   planet, for instance, the performances are made the cover for a
   jail-break; on a planet inhabited by a race priding themselves on their
   musical talents, the productions are vetted by an artistic inspector
   and the company is fined for every unresolved dissonance in the scores
   performed; on still another, the performance is mistaken for a trade
   exhibition and the aliens attempt to buy some of the singers.

   While Gondar is confined to his cabin, apparently insane, Madoc Roswyn
   induces his deputy to take the ship to the distant planet Yan. It
   emerges that her remote ancestors inhabited a land now sunk beneath the
   Bay of Biscay whose people had colonized that planet and there
   developed a high civilization. (Here we detect the germ of Vance's
   later major fantasy trilogy Lyonesse, the heroine of whose third volume
   is named Madouc.) A group had returned to Earth thousands of years
   later, but their spacecraft was destroyed and they were forced to
   settle in Wales, ever intending to return to Yan. Madoc is their last
   descendant. She is disappointed by what she finds: Yan's cities are
   dust and its folk have reverted to barbarism, hiding in the forests.
   Although the company present Debussy's Pelleas to try to establish
   communication with the unseen inhabitants, they barely escape with
   their lives.

   Eventually the voyage ends at Rlaru. It turns out that Gondar had
   abducted the Ninth Company from the planet; he is suitably punished by
   the natives, who demonstrate a capacity to creatively manipulate
   illusion and environment far beyond anything their Earth visitors can
   achieve. They listen to several operas with mounting boredom, but are
   utterly entranced by an impromptu washboard jazz band formed by some
   members of the crew, which has been a source of annoyance to the
   opera-lovers throughout the voyage. (Vance was at one time a jazz
   musician.) Dame Isabel returns to Earth, chastened but determined not
   to admit it; Roger marries Madoc Roswyn and begins writing a book
   describing the voyage.
