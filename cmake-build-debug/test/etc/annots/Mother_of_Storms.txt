   In the early 21st century, the Earth suffers from a giant hurricane
   spawned by the release of clathrate compounds, as the result of a
   nuclear explosion. While the hurricane spawns hundreds of progeny,
   which, by novel's end, kill at least 1 billion people, two massively
   computer augmented human intelligences, both of whom witness their
   organic bodies die, race to corral a comet from beyond Pluto's orbit.
   They use the ice from the comet to reduce the Earth's surface
   temperatures, and quell the mother of storms.
