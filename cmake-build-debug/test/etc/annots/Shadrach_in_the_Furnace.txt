   The story begins on 14 May 2012 as Dr. Shadrach Mordecai, personal
   physician of the dictator Genghis II Mao IV, awakens. He checks the
   health of the dictator through a series of implants within his body
   that link to the general health of his client, allowing him to receive
   any information on the health of the dictator through codings of
   various twitches in his own body. Through a series of security checks,
   he enters into his office to prepare for a kidney transplant for his
   master.

   As he passes Surveillance Vector One, the eye on the world which gives
   committee members the ability to view all events happening on Earth, he
   meets Mangu, the prince of the world and viceroy of the committee, a
   charming man who earns the admiration of all his subjects. Mangu is
   concerned about the surgery, but Shadrach Mordecai assures the prince
   that Genghis Mao has grown used to surgeries. Here, Shadrach also
   reveals to the reader that Mangu was chosen as the subject for Project
   Avatar, where Genghis Mao will continue to reign in the body of his own
   son. He also feels sorry for Mangu, since he was tricked by his father
   into believing that he would inherit the throne. Once in his office, he
   contacts Nicholas Warhaftig, surgeon of the dictator. Warhaftig orders
   Shadrach to bring Genghis Mao to the Surgery by 0900. Soon, Genghis Mao
   himself contacts Shadrach to ask how his health is that day. As
   Shadrach tells the dictator of his health state, he also informs the
   dictator of the incoming surgery and its timing. Genghis Mao requests
   for Shadrach to enter his room and prepare him for the surgery at 0900.
   We also learn from this conversation that the surgery would give the
   dictator the fourth liver he is having. Afterwards, Shadrach looks up
   the leaders of the projects Talos, Phoenix and Avatar, for it is his
   responsibility as personal physician to the Khan to keep checks on the
   progress of such projects. First, he contacts Katya Lindman of Project
   Talos. She reports to Shadrach their progress in coding Genghis Mao's
   eyelid mannerisms and as Shadrach asks her to continue working on
   coding his mental processes, she has an apprehensive look but agrees.
   Next, he contacts Irayne Sarafrazi of Project Phoenix. She talks of her
   problems with brain cell deterioration and becomes worried as Shadrach
   presses for her to make further progress in the subject. Lastly, he
   contacts Nikki Crowfoot of Project Avatar, who is also Shadrach's
   lover. After she recounts her progress, she arranges a meeting with
   Shadrach for 0230.

   Shadrach reveals to the reader his belief that Project Avatar is far
   superior to the other two, since Project Talos could only create an
   automated Genghis Mao which could never live up to the ability of the
   original while Project Phoenix would constantly be confronted with the
   problem of brain cell regeneration. Afterwards, he leaves to take
   Genghis Mao to the Surgery. As Warhaftig and his team operate on the
   dictator, Shadrach, due to his implants, acts as a "computer" for the
   team, informing them of the health status of the dictator throughout
   the entire surgical process. During the operation, Shadrach also
   comments on the calmness and tranquility of the dictator and how he has
   grown accustomed to constant organ transplants. After the surgery, he
   prepares to leave with Crowfoot to Karakorum, the playground of the
   world's ruling class. As they enter Karakorum, Nikki Crowfoot muses
   about how Shadrach and Genghis Mao are like one entity and compares
   them to the sculptor and his sculpture, how the actions and health
   situation of Genghis Mao affect the actions of Shadrach. Nikki Crowfoot
   decides they ought to go to the transtemporallism tent, where
   supposedly religious rites are carried out using chemicals to transport
   a client into a dream-like state where he may witness famous scenes,
   usually related to Christianity. Shadrach is transported to the scene
   of the Cotopaxi eruption, where he helplessly watches the civilians die
   all around him. When he wakes up and leaves the tent, he sees many
   government members, who greet him. Among them is Roger Buckmaster, who
   claims that he has gained enlightenment from the transtemporallist
   experience.

   Buckmaster first recounts his dream of the Last Supper and the
   subsequent betrayal at Gethsemane, and how it taught him to hate evil.
   Then, he begins insulting Shadrach and blaming him for keeping Genghis
   Mao alive. Both Shadrach and Buckmaster have a lengthy moral argument,
   but soon Nikki Crowfoot leaves the tent and they leave the area, with
   Buckmaster shouting curses to Shadrach. Shadrach and Nikki book a room
   and sleep together, after which they encounter Bela Horthy and Donna
   Lambile, two members of the government.

   Mangu is giving a speech about the worldwide distribution of Rondevic's
   Antidote against organ rot, to which Bela Horthy yells curses that
   Genghis Mao constantly lies about healing the world from the organ rot
   disease, despite the desperate urgings of Lambile. The next day,
   Shadrach awakes feeling tremendous vigorous twitches from the implants
   and immediately rushes to meet the Khan. There, he sees many government
   members surrounding the dictator. He learns from Ionigylakis, the Vice
   President, that Mangu was assassinated. He soon realises that the
   twitches were due to the shock from Genghis Mao when he received the
   news. He also learns that Bela Horthy was the one who witnesses Mangu
   falling from his window before he informed the Khan. Genghis Mao gives
   Avogadro, the security chief, orders for subsequent arrests and
   sentences against suspected individuals in order to invoke fear into
   the population.

   In Committee Vector One, Shadrach has a brief conversation with
   Avogadro, who states that no one, not even Bela Horthy, saw any
   assassins throw Mangu out of the window, thus many government members
   believe it was merely suicide, but Genghis Mao remains convinced that
   Mangu was killed. Shadrach then asks Bela Horthy about the exact
   recount he gave to Genghis Mao. At first, Horthy is apprehensive but
   soon replies that he merely stated that Mangu had died and nothing
   else. Shadrach also learns from Horthy that Buckmaster has become a
   prime suspect in the assassination case due to his words of folly at
   Karakorum the previous night. Shadrach asks Horthy about his own words
   at Karakorum, but Horthy insists that he was not at Karakorum at all.
   Meanwhile, the committee members are in chaos as General Gonchigdorge
   struggles anxiously to find possible suspects and Surveillance Vector
   One. As the general calls for Frank Ficifolia, Ficifolia reveals to
   Shadrach his opinion that the committee members have gone mad and that
   Mangu had probably committed suicide. Shadrach returns to his room,
   where he sees Nikki Crowfoot. He recounts to her the incidents that
   occurred and Crowfoot is immediately shocked since her project is
   affected by the death of the chosen subject. As she listens to the
   subsequent events, she comments that Bela Horthy probably intended for
   Genghis Mao to feel great shock due to his testimony and perish.
   Shadrach returns to his office where he receives a call from Katya
   Lindman, who requests that he review her progress on Project Talos. She
   shows the robot of Genghis Mao and all its actions and becomes angry
   when Shadrach does not seem impressed. As she continues to show
   Shadrach all her equipment, Shadrach begins to suspect that she has
   feelings for him.

   Later on, he receives a call from Avogadro to participate in his
   interrogation of Buckmaster. During the interrogation, Buckmaster
   constantly defends himself, saying that he was drugged from the
   transtemporallism. Avogadro is shocked that Shadrach also attempts to
   defend Buckmaster, but more passively. However, in the end, Buckmaster
   is arrested on the basis of a faulty "I'll destroy him" while he was
   arguing with Shadrach at Karakorum. Shadrach then argues with Avogadro,
   saying that it was not justified to arrest a man he knew was innocent.
   However, Avogadro is apathetic to the plight of Buckmaster and even
   uses Shadrach's words at Karakorum against him that "guilt is a luxury
   we cannot afford". They both assume that Buckmaster is being sent to
   the Organ Farms, where his organs would be used to support the
   dictator. The next day, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao, who speaks
   deliriously and even offers to make Shadrach pope in Rome. Shadrach
   infers that Genghis Mao has gone mad over the death of Mangu. That
   night, he goes to Karakorum with Katya Lindman, where they try
   dream-death, an experience where one is placed in a dream-like state
   and imagines death and the subsequent afterlife. Shadrach travels the
   afterlife realm with Katya in his dreams, and after enjoying
   themselves, to enters into a tranquil state before awaking. Katya
   reveals that she was having a different dream from him, one which was
   not as light-hearted as his. Then, they return home to rest, where
   Katya randomly and suddenly warns Shadrach to be careful. Nikki
   Crowfoot grows increasingly distant from him, and Shadrach is unable to
   discover why. He visits Genghis Mao and informs the dictator of an
   aneurysm he detected in the dictator's abdominal aorta. The news annoys
   Genghis Mao, since he is preparing a colossal funeral for Mangu which
   he refuses to delay. Shadrach has lunch with Katya, who reveals to him
   that, on the night before his death, she informed Mangu that he was
   chosen as the Avatar subject. Katya tells Shadrach that she did so only
   out of sympathy for Mangu, but Shadrach suspects that she wanted to
   kill the Avatar subject so that her project could supersede Nikki's and
   hopefully destroy her relationship with Shadrach so she could have him
   too. However, he soon realises that his suspicions contradict Katya's
   decision to reveal this information to him. Shadrach hopes to visit
   Nikki and after learning that she had fallen ill, makes the decision to
   visit her in her room. There, he pretends to examine her but
   subsequently asks about her project, to which she responds angrily,
   ranting about the setbacks in her work. As Shadrach leaves, he also
   reveals to Nikki that a member of Project Talos informed Mangu that he
   had been chosen as the Avatar subject, but he disguises it as a rumour.
   However, Nikki believes it and instantly suspects Katya Lindman to be
   the culprit. Later, Shadrach confesses to Katya what he had revealed to
   Nikki. Katya is disturbed at first, but soon informs Shadrach that he
   had been chosen as the next Avatar subject. Shadrach soon realises that
   that had to be the reason Nikki had chosen to distance herself from
   him. Katya advises Shadrach to make a plan of escape and also tells him
   not to trust Nikki anymore, since she must have agreed to continue her
   work despite the fact that he was chosen. The day of the aorta
   transplant arrives. During the surgeries, Shadrach thinks to himself
   that if he killed Genghis Mao on the operating table, Project Avatar
   would be finished. He muses about plans such as jostling Warhaftig's
   elbow or feeding them misleading information, but resolves not to.

   In his office, Shadrach begins thinking about Genghis Mao's possible
   origins and begins crafting fake diary entries from the perspective of
   Genghis Mao in his mind. Soon, he decides to confront Nikki Crowfoot
   about him being the Avatar subject. Nikki is shocked and somewhat
   remorseful, but she defends herself, saying there was nothing she could
   do. Shadrach is distraught, but lets the matter rest. He resorts to
   carpentry to cope with the stress. On one of his adventures to the
   carpentry chapel, he meets Frank Ficifolia, who offers Shadrach the
   chance to escape from Ulan Bator and remain hidden. Ficifolia also
   reveals that members of the government helped to conceal Buckmaster,
   who is still alive, and offers to do the same for Shadrach. However,
   Shadrach is unsure and asks for time to think. Then, he is approached
   by Bela Horthy, who advises Shadrach to take the offer and flee from
   Ulan Bator, but Shadrach continues to refuse. He makes a visit to the
   Project Avatar laboratory to meet Nikki Crowfoot. After a tour of the
   laboratory, Nikki takes him to her office. She advises Shadrach to flee
   from Ulan Bator, even at the expense of her work. However, Shadrach
   still wants more time to think, to which Nikki responds that she loves
   him still. Soon, Shadrach decides to go on a vacation so that he would
   think better overseas. He informs Genghis Mao about his decision, who
   is slightly disappointed but agrees. Shadrach first goes to Nairobi,
   where he meets Bhishma Das, a merchant. Bhishma Das constantly asks him
   questions about the organ rot disease and the Roncevic's Antidote. As
   they continue their conversation, Shadrach begins speaking of utopian
   ideals that, after many years, the world will rebuild itself. Although
   he is unsure of this prophecy, under the encouragement of Bhishma Das,
   he becomes convinced that that will eventually happen. This gives him
   encouragement to deal with the problem of Project Avatar. He then
   leaves for Jerusalem, where he meets Meshach Yakov at the Wailing Wall.
   Shadrach is distressed about the widespread organ rot and poverty
   amongst the people, including children, and he prays. Meshach takes
   Shadrach to his house, where he and his family chat with Shadrach about
   politics. He then goes to Istanbul, Rome and San Franscisco. In each
   place, he is constantly distressed by the suffering of the people but
   also begins to suspect that the Citpols, policemen of the Genghis Mao
   regime, are spying on him.

   At San Franscisco, he meets an old friend, Jim Ehrenreich, who is
   struck with organ rot and requests that Shadrach steal some of
   Rondevic's Antidote for him. However, Shadrach refuses, saying that the
   antidote only immunises and cannot cure. At first, Ehrenreich is angry
   but after a while, he accepts his fate. At Peking, Shadrach begins to
   feel strange twitches in his implants and after a series of checks
   begins to suspect clogging of cerebrospinal fluid. He rushes to the
   airport, hoping to get a quick flight back to Ulan Bator. At the
   airport, he meets Avogadro, who informs Shadrach of the multiple
   headaches suffered by Genghis Mao and that he requested for Shadrach's
   return to the capital. Shadrach returns to the capital and visits
   Genghis Mao, informing his master of the problem and suggests that it
   be cured by brain surgery: more specifically, to implant valved tubes
   to his skull to drain the excess fluid. Afterwards, Shadrach arranges a
   meeting with Frank Ficifolia, requesting to meet Buckmaster. Although
   Ficifolia is annoyed that Shadrach chose to return when he could have
   escaped the capital, Shadrach reassures him that he has a plan.
   Ficifolia agrees to arrange the meeting. Shadrach is taken to the
   transtemporallists in Karakorum, where Buckmaster has hidden himself as
   an ascetic, entering multiple dreams to witness the life of Jesus.
   Shadrach requests for Buckmaster to create a device that will allow him
   to control the valve that will be implanted into Genghis Mao, and after
   much persuasion, Buckmaster agrees.

   In Ulan Bator, he arranges a meeting with Katya Lindman. Both of them
   talk about the funeral of Mangu, which he missed while he was on
   holiday. He also informs her about his cure for the headaches of
   Genghis Mao, and despite the warnings of Katya, Shadrach states that he
   has a plan to save himself. Soon, Genghis Mao is operated on and the
   valved tubes transplanted. He then meets Nikki Crowfoot, who informs
   him of her progress in Project Avatar. She adds that she hopes her
   project will not be chosen, but Shadrach tells her not to worry about
   him but to focus on her work instead. To rest, he leaves again for
   Karakorum unaccompanied and visits the dream-death tent, where he
   enters the afterlife and heals numerous people in the dream. He is
   hailed as their Saviour but is soon interrupted by the scene of Katya
   informing him that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Shocked, he
   awakens and returns to Ulaanbaatar. Already implanted with the device
   to control the valved tubes, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao and informs
   him of how he is able to control the tubes using the device implanted
   in his hand and whenever he clenches his fist, the tubes will reverse,
   quickly killing the dictator. Instead of begging or becoming angry,
   Genghis Mao is pleased and informs Shadrach that he was never going to
   become the Avatar subject in the first place. He also admires
   Shadrach's shrewdness in dealing with the situation. Shadrach demands
   to become a committee member in charge of public health to oversee the
   production and worldwide distribution of Roncevic's Antidote. Genghis
   Mao agrees and, confused about the dictator's reactions, Shadrach
   leaves the room to admire the outside world.
