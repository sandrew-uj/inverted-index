   The game is set in a fictional alternate world United States in 1995,
   ten years after the American government privatised all police forces.
   The country has been divided into Policed Zones -- mainly large cities
   -- and Non-Policed Zones, mainly the highways and areas between cities.
   Ecological disaster has overtaken the country as well, with the Great
   Lakes having shrunk to a fraction of their size, and the Midwest turned
   into a desert. The players take on the role of mercenaries called
   "Sanctioned Operatives" or "Ops", who are hired for a variety of
   missions on the unpoliced highways.
