   Two New Englanders, John Branner and his friend Griswell, travel in the
   South and spend the night in a deserted plantation manor. Griswell
   awakens from a dream of a yellow-faced creature looking at him. He sees
   Branner walk up the stairs in a trance. He is horrified when Branner
   returns as an animated corpse gripping the bloody axe that had split
   his skull. Griswell flees into the woods.

   In his flight, he meets the county's sheriff, Buckner, who investigates
   the house and finds Branner motionless on the floor. Griswell is
   implicated in his friend's murder, but the sheriff gives him the
   benefit of the doubt and tries to clear him. Buckner gives some
   credence to Griswell's bizarre tale due to the manor's ominous
   reputation. It was the Blassenville's residence, family from the West
   Indies who were known for their cruelty.

   After the American Civil War, the Blassenvilles fell into poverty, with
   all their menfolk dead and only four sisters remaining, shortly to be
   joined by their aunt Celia from the West Indies and her mulatto maid
   Joan. Celia mistreated Joan, and when the latter disappeared, it was
   thought she had run away. Soon after, Celia vanished as well, and it
   was thought that she had returned to the West Indies. Over the next
   months, three of the Blassenville sisters also vanished one by one. One
   night in 1890, the last of the Blassenvilles, Elizabeth, fled the
   house, claiming she had found her sisters' corpses in a secret room and
   that she had been attacked by the shape of a woman with a yellow face.
   She left for California and never returned. The manor has lain deserted
   since, and the local black folk shun it. The eponymous pigeons
   sometimes flock about the decaying manor. Legend has it that they are
   the Blassenvilles' souls.

   The following evening, Buckner and Griswell visit the hut of an ancient
   voodoo man, Jacob, seeking information about the house and the
   Blassenvilles. Jacob tells of the extinct family and of Celia
   Blassenville, who mistreated her mulatto maid Joan. He claims to be a
   maker of "zuvembies", but he insists he cannot talk about them to a
   white man without Damballah sending a snake with a white crescent moon
   on its head to kill him. But he drifts into senility and rambles about
   voodoo, the god Damballah, and about zombies and their female
   counterparts, zuvembies, who live only to kill and have no sense of
   time, possess hypnotic powers, and who can live indefinitely unless
   wounded by "steel or lead". Finally, he tells how "she" participated in
   voodoo rites and that "the other" came to Jacob for the "Black Brew"
   that makes a woman a zuvembie. Reaching for firewood, Jacob is bitten
   by a venomous snake, meeting the fate he feared. Buckner and Griswell
   conclude that Joan transformed herself into a zuvembie to exact
   vengeance on Celia Blassenville and her nieces. They resolve to spend
   the night in Blassenville Manor to learn the truth. There they find
   Elizabeth Blassenville's diary, which tells of her fear that something
   is in the house with her, has killed her sisters, and will kill her
   too.

   That night, while lying awake in the darkness, Griswell hears the same
   whistling as the previous night, which Elizabeth's diary had also
   mentioned. Thinking he is fleeing the house, he finds himself climbing
   the manor stairs against his will. He is confronted by a female
   apparition with a yellow face and a knife. Griswell is powerless to
   resist, but Bruckner, who has followed him up the stairs, shoots the
   creature, which flees, mortally wounded. They track its dying noises to
   the secret room where they find the hanging bodies of the three missing
   Blassenville sisters as well as the corpse of the zuvembie, which is
   still dressed in a ball gown.

   Bruckner recognises the face of the zuvembie from a portrait he has
   seen. It is Celia Blassenville. The maid Joan, in revenge, gave the
   Black Brew she got from Jacob to her mistress and fled. Celia
   Blassenville, transformed into a zuvembie, killed three of her nieces
   and had been living in the abandoned manor, killing anyone who entered
   it at night.

   Bruckner says that the case can be closed by saying that a madwoman had
   killed Griswell's friend John Branner, since nobody will believe the
   truth of the matter.
