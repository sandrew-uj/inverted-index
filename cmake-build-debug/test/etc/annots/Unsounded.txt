   Unsounded describes itself as covering "fall into the Epic Fantasy
   Adventure genre, with occasional forays into the horrific, the profane,
   and the goofy". It follows the lion-tailed daughter of the Lord of
   Thieves, Sette Frummagem, as accompanied by the resurrected soldier
   Duane Adelier, she travels through the continent of Kasslyne, divided
   by a war between Alderode and Cresce, who fight over land, politics,
   religious beliefs, and simple bad blood. However, both agree that power
   lies in the Khert, the invisible spectral plane that holds all life and
   laws together. Using pymary (a type of magic), a spellcaster can bend
   the world around them.
