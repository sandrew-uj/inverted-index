   The story begins at dusk in Salem Village, Massachusetts as young
   Goodman Brown leaves Faith, his wife of three months, for some unknown
   errand in the forest. Faith pleads with her husband to stay with her,
   but he insists that the journey must be completed that night. In the
   forest he meets an older man, dressed in a similar manner and bearing a
   physical resemblance to himself. The man carries a black serpent-shaped
   staff. Deeper in the woods, the two encounter Goody Cloyse, an older
   woman, whom Young Goodman had known as a boy and who had taught him his
   catechism. Cloyse complains about the need to walk; the older man
   throws his staff on the ground for the woman and quickly leaves with
   Brown.

   Other townspeople inhabit the woods that night, traveling in the same
   direction as Goodman Brown. When he hears his wife's voice in the
   trees, he calls out but is not answered. He then runs angrily through
   the forest, distraught that his beautiful Faith is lost somewhere in
   the dark, sinful forest. He soon stumbles upon a clearing at midnight
   where all the townspeople assembled. At the ceremony, which is carried
   out at a flame-lit altar of rocks, the newest acolytes are brought
   forth--Goodman Brown and Faith. They are the only two of the
   townspeople not yet initiated. Goodman Brown calls to heaven and Faith
   to resist and instantly the scene vanishes. Arriving back at his home
   in Salem the next morning, Goodman Brown is uncertain whether the
   previous night's events were real or a dream, but he is deeply shaken,
   and his belief he lives in a Christian community is distorted. He loses
   his faith in his wife, along with all of humanity. He lives his life an
   embittered and suspicious cynic, wary of everyone around him. The story
   concludes: "And when he had lived long, and was borne to his grave...
   they carved no hopeful verse upon his tombstone, for his dying hour was
   gloom."
