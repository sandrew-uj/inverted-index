   Like many other Burroughs stories, A Fighting Man of Mars resembles The
   Arabian Nights.^[1] The story is purportedly relayed back to earth via
   the Gridley Wave, a sort of super radio frequency previously introduced
   in Tanar of Pellucidar, the third of Burrough's Pellucidar novels,
   which thus provides a link between the two series. The story-teller is
   Ulysses Paxton, protagonist of the previous novel, The Master Mind of
   Mars, but this story is not about him; rather, it is the tale of Tan
   Hadron of Hastor, a lowly, poor padwar (a low-ranking officer) who is
   in love with the beautiful, haughty Sanoma Tora, daughter of Tor Hatan,
   a minor but rich noble. As he is only a padwar, Sanoma spurns him. Then
   Sanoma Tora is kidnapped, and the novel moves into high gear.

   As Tan Hadron crosses Mars ("Barsoom", as Burroughs calls it) searching
   for Sanoma Tora, he encounters some of Barsoom's most ferocious beasts:
   huge, many-armed, flesh-eating white apes, gigantic spiders, and the
   insane cannibals of U-Gor. He also meets the mad scientist Phor Tak,
   who cackles "Heigh-oo!" and is crazed with the desire for revenge.

   The initial simplicity of Burroughs' well-worn pursuit plot is
   elaborated by Hadron's rescue of an escaped slave, Tavia, from a band
   of six-limbed Green Martians of Torquas, en route to the city of Jahar
   where Hadron believes Sanoma Tora has been taken. Tavia is an atypical
   Burroughs heroine; depicted as self-reliant and competent with weapons,
   witty and intelligent, she compares favorably for both reader and
   Hadron with beautiful but shallow Sanoma Tora, who ultimately shows
   herself unworthy of the virtuous hero. With the addition of Nur An, a
   disaffected Jaharian warrior, and another escaped woman slave, Phao,
   Hadron's quest becomes more collaborative than Burroughs' usual,
   although Tavia, in an unsurprising plot development, is revealed to be
   a princess at the end.
