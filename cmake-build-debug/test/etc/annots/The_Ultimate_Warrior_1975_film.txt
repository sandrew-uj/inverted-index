   Following a global pandemic which devastates the population, Baron
   (Sydow), the leader of a tribe of survivors, has established a small
   fortified area in the ruins of New York City. Cal (Kelton), a former
   scientist and a member of Baron's tribe, has developed plague resistant
   seeds which allows the tribe to grow vegetables in the barren soil.
   Their small garden has become an oasis in the ruined city, coveted by
   the packs of starving, lawless gangs outside.

   Needing to increase security against the raiders, especially a gang led
   by Carrot (Smith), Baron recruits a deadly warrior named Carson
   (Brynner), who has put his skills out for hire.

   While Carson's presence has some of the desired effect, the daily raids
   against the sanctuary make Baron realize the only hope for his pregnant
   daughter Melinda (Miles) and his unborn grandchild, is for them to
   leave the city, and establish a new society in a more secure setting on
   a small island off the coast of North Carolina.

   Escaping from the city is more difficult than anticipated, resulting in
   the deaths of Baron and many of the tribe and costing Carson his hand.
   Carson kills Carrot and most of his followers while being chased
   through the city's subway system. He gets Melinda and the precious
   seeds out of the city.
