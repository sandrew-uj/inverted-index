   In Poland, approximately 70 years before the present, the 10-year-old
   Polish-Jewish Leopold (Leo) Gursky falls in love with his neighbor Alma
   Mereminski. The two begin a relationship that develops over the course
   of 10 years. In this time, Leo writes three books that he gives to
   Alma, since she is the only person he deeply cares about. Leo promises
   he will never love anyone but her.

   Alma, now 20, is sent to the United States by her father, who feared
   the alarming news concerning Nazi Germany. Leo does not know that Alma
   is pregnant and dreams of going to America to meet her. A short time
   after, the Germans invade Poland and Leo takes cover in the woods,
   living on roots, small animals, bugs and what he can steal from
   farmers' cellars. After three and a half years of hiding, he goes to
   America and finds Alma but is shocked to hear she thought he had died
   in the war and had married the son of the manager of the factory she
   works at. He is devastated when he finds she has had another child with
   her husband. He asks her to come with him, but she refuses. She tells
   him, however, about his son Isaac who is now five years old.
   Heartbroken, Leo leaves, and later becomes a locksmith under the
   guidance of his cousin. Leo regularly watches Isaac from a distance,
   wishing to be part of the boy's life but scared to come in contact with
   him.

   In the present day, Leo is a lonely old man who waits for his death,
   along with his recently found childhood friend, Bruno, and Alma has
   been dead for five years. Leo still keeps track of his son, who has
   become a famous writer, much to Leo's enjoyment since he believes Isaac
   inherited the talent from his father. Leo's depression deepens when he
   reads in a newspaper that his son has died at the age of 60, and Leo
   develops an obsession with finding his place in his son's world, to the
   extent that he breaks into Isaac's house to see if he had read Words
   for Everything, a book about his life that he recently wrote and sent
   to Isaac.

   Zvi Litvinoff's perspective is introduced. In the past, a younger Leo
   wrote a letter to his old friend Zvi, asking for his manuscript of The
   History of Love to be returned to him. Leo had given Zvi The History
   before they parted, years ago. However, his wife Rosa informs him that
   the book was destroyed in a flood, choosing to hide that her husband
   did not write The History of Love. Zvi also describes an event where
   Leo fell gravely ill in Poland and wrote his own obituary, after which
   Zvi stole it in the hope that it would keep his friend alive.

   Unknown to Leo is that the book had been published in a small printing
   of two thousand copies (and re-published upon the supposed author's
   death) in Spanish, but under the name of Zvi Litvinoff, who copied the
   book thinking Leo was killed in Poland. Zvi felt so guilty for copying
   his book that he added his friend's stolen obituary as the last
   chapter, telling the publisher that including the obituary was
   conditional to printing the book, although doing so did not make sense
   with the plot. Zvi died later without telling the world about the real
   author of The History of Love.

   In a parallel story, a 15-year-old girl, Alma Singer, named after the
   Alma in The History of Love, her parents' favorite book, is struggling
   to cope with the loss of her father due to cancer. Her mother becomes
   distant and lonely, escaping into her work of book translation. Her
   younger brother Bird, so called for jumping from the second story of a
   building hoping he could fly, seeks refuge in religion and believes
   himself to be one of God's chosen people, thus distancing himself from
   reality. Alma finds refuge in one of her father's hobbies: surviving in
   the wild. Alma also bears a crush on her Russian pen friend Misha, who
   has moved to New York. The two become a couple but they break up
   because of Alma's incertitude.

   One day, her mother receives a letter from a mysterious man named Jacob
   Marcus who requests that she translate The History of Love from Spanish
   to English for $100,000, to be paid in increments of $25,000 as the
   work progresses. Alma's mother finds the sum suspicious, but the
   stranger confesses that his mother used to read the book to him when he
   was a child, so it has a great sentimental value. Alma sees this as an
   opportunity to help her mother recover from her depression and changes
   her mother's straightforward letters to Jacob Marcus into more romantic
   versions. When the letters stop before her mother completes the
   translation of the book, Alma decides to find the mysterious client.

   She starts by noting down what she knows about Jacob Marcus in her
   diary, and concludes that the Alma in the book was real and proceeds to
   find her. She struggles in her search for Alma Mereminski, but succeeds
   when she realizes that Alma could have married and finds her under the
   name of Moritz. She is disappointed to hear that Alma has been dead for
   five years. However, she finds out that Isaac Moritz is the first of
   Alma's sons and a famous writer. When she starts reading his
   bestselling book, she finds that the main character's name is Jacob
   Marcus and realizes that Isaac Moritz had hired her mother to translate
   the book. Isaac is dead, however, which explains why his letters had
   stopped coming to their home. To be sure about her suspicions, Alma
   leaves a note on Isaac's door asking who the writer of the novel is.

   In the meanwhile, Bird finds Alma's diary and misinterprets the names
   Alma Mereminski and Alma Moritz as being his sister's real names, and
   believes they had different fathers. Isaac's brother calls Alma, after
   reading the note and the original manuscript of the book, to tell her
   that Gursky is the real author, but Bird answers the telephone and it
   confuses him even further. He now suspects that Leopold Gursky is
   Alma's real father. To cleanse his sin of bragging and to regain the
   status as one of the chosen ones, he decides to set up a meeting with
   Alma and Gursky, thus doing a good deed without anybody knowing except
   God.

   When the two receive the letter regarding their meeting, both are
   confused: Alma tries to discover which of the people she met during her
   searches could have sent her the note, while Leo comes to believe it
   was Alma who sent him the note, despite her being dead.

   Leo settles himself on a park bench, waiting a long while for Alma to
   appear. He ponders his life, key moments from his past, the loss of his
   love, and what it means to be human. He imagines that he will die while
   he is waiting there, his own death and mortality being one of his
   preoccupations in the novel. When Alma finally appears, he and she are
   both confused, although at first Leo believes that she is his Alma from
   the past and that she is really just in his imagination. After he
   realizes that she doesn't look like his Alma, and he gets confirmation
   from a man walking by that the Alma who is there is actually real, Leo
   talks to her briefly about Bruno and Isaac, while Alma starts piecing
   together the puzzle of who Leo is. When Alma asks him if he ever loved
   a girl named Alma Mereminski, the old man finally feels a sense of
   transcendence in being recognized at long last, and instead of being
   able to respond to Alma's questions with words, he keeps tapping his
   fingers twice against her. She puts her head on his shoulder and hugs
   him, and he is finally able to speak again, saying her name three times
   and giving her her own feeling of transcendence at finally being
   recognized, too.

   (Some readers believe that Leo has a heart attack and dies at this
   point, possibly because of Leo's earlier assumption that he is about to
   die, and also because he says during this meeting with Alma, "I felt my
   heart surge. I thought: I've lived this long. Please. A little longer
   won't kill me." A more compelling case can be made that the novel, for
   all its poignancy, simply ends with this mutually transcendent moment
   for these two characters.)

   The last chapter is entitled "The Death of Leopold Gursky" and is
   identical with the last chapter of the book inside a book The History
   of Love, both being the self-written obituary of Leopold Gursky. By
   ending the novel this way, Krauss is richly alluding to earlier parts
   of the novel and to her theme of how words keep people alive for us,
   indeed, make people in danger of becoming invisible, visible. Zvi
   Litvinoff carried Leo's self-written obit in his pocket for years, as a
   talisman guarding against Leo's death. Litvinoff, when preparing
   History of Love for publication, insists that his editor include the
   Leo Gursky obit at the end, his way of ensuring that Leo will continue
   to "live" in the hearts of all readers of the book. And finally, Nicole
   Krauss includes the same obit at the end of her novel, as a way of
   urging all readers to keep this Leo, and all Leos, alive.
