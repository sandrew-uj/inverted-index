   The United States turns its military into a much smaller force,
   switching its priorities to domestic matters, beginning with using the
   U.S. military budget to fill the gap in Social Security's trust fund
   left there by past Congresses and presidents who spent the money on
   other things, and continuing onward in the same theme.

   As the U.S. is downsizing its military, China becomes a world
   superpower, building new supercarriers and becoming a dominant naval
   power in addition to a growing economic power. Eventually, China goes
   down the route of conquest.

   China begins to conquer Eurasia to such an extent that it reaches the
   borders of the European Union in the west. With most of Asia under its
   domination, including Japan, everyone assumes China is coming for
   Europe next; however, through a strategy of misdirection making the
   Europeans think they will invade Western Europe, they actually pin the
   European naval force in the Mediterranean and blockade it, neutralizing
   it as a threat without the cost of invasion.

   China instead throws its resources into attacking the Caribbean. Due to
   the Monroe Doctrine, new President Bill Baker, who came to office on a
   pro-war platform, has to make a critical decision: to try to halt them
   with conventional forces, or use nuclear weapons.

   The U.S. must make a decision as the Chinese invasion forces in Central
   America gather steam: to build traditional naval super-carriers to meet
   the new Chinese ones, or to build highly experimental arsenal ships
   capable of firing thousands of missiles at once, showering its target
   with overwhelming force while having a crew of only around 100 due to
   the extent of automation. They might be more effective but are also
   untested, and the U.S. does not have the resources for both. Baker
   decides to back the arsenal ships.

   As the likelihood of invasion via the Gulf of Mexico comes, many
   Americans leave the exposed states. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are not
   sure if this is another diversion attempt and the Chinese might come
   from the east or west coasts. The U.S. President orders the military to
   plan for those eventualities as well. A full war economy along with
   total mobilization is called up, including all able-bodied women, which
   includes the U.S. President's daughter.

   Baker refuses to order a nuclear strike and orders the military to meet
   the threat with conventional arms come what may. He is convinced any
   nuclear strike will lead to a series of escalating exchanges that will
   leave the two countries so destroyed that neither side can achieve any
   victory.

   Baker is frequently meeting in the situation room, or the Map Room of
   the White House (returned to its original purpose) to oversee plans.
   There is tension between the Chinese military and civilian leaderships
   and Baker is trying to make a behind-the-scenes deal with the civilian
   leaders. Baker tells the National Security Council, "We will die as a
   united nation of 50 states or we will win; there will be no territorial
   concessions".

   In the meantime, the U.S. braces for invasion.
