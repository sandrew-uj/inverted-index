   The story opens at the wedding of the Cossack yesaul Gorobets's son in
   a neighborhood of Kiev. Among the guests are the recently married
   Cossack, pan Danilo Burulbash, and his wife, pani Katerina, who live
   just across the Dnieper River. They are honored guests, Danilo is
   Gorobets's sworn brother. Not present, though, is Katerina's father,
   who was expected to appear after having spent 21 years in foreign
   lands.

   During the celebration, the yesaul brings out two holy icons, at the
   sight of which a stranger, dressed like a Cossack, stops his festive as
   well as mocking dance, and transforms into a sorcerer with a sharp
   chin, a beak, green eyes, and bluish lips. In sight of the shocked
   crowd, he disappears.

   Danilo and Katerina discuss the sorcerer in a boat, paddled by two men,
   on their way home across the Dnieper. As they pass a cemetery, corpses
   come out of the ground, each more terrifying than the previous one and
   each screaming "I'm suffocating". Danilo tells her and their baby son
   Ivan that Cossacks do not fear sorcerers.

   As soon as Katerina's father arrives at her and Danilo's home the next
   morning, an argument starts when he demands that she explain her late
   return the previous night. Danilo also notices that, unlike the
   Cossacks, his father-in-law refuses to eat halusky and pork, only
   pretends to drink mead, and generally acts more like the Poles and
   Turks than one of their own. In the ensuing saber and gun fight,
   Katerina's father shoots Danilo in the arm before she intervenes and
   begs them to forgive one another.

   Katerina then tells Danilo about her dream the previous night about a
   sorcerer who wants to marry her, which Danilo takes to be a grave sign.
   Later in the evening, Danilo notices unexpected flashes from a distant,
   abandoned castle. He makes sure Katerina is safe at home and goes to
   investigate. When he climbs up a tree outside the lit window, he sees
   Katerina's father calling up spells, and her soul appears in a blue
   haze. The sorcerer commands her to marry him, Danilo is horrified to
   discover that his father-in-law is a sorcerer. Once Danilo returns
   home, his wife recounts to him a strange incestuous dream, which
   matches what Danilo witnessed in the castle. She accepts Danilo's
   explanation that her father is the Antichrist.

   The Cossacks capture the sorcerer and chain him in the cellar of Danilo
   and Katerina's house. Her father tells Katerina that the chains do not
   confine him, but that the walls are ensorcelled as they were built by a
   starets, an Orthodox monk. He imposes on Katerina to release him for
   his soul's deliverance. Convinced that he will repent and be saved,
   Katerina sets him free and soon curses herself for doing so.

   A group of Poles, organized by the sorcerer, come to take Danilo's land
   but they are struck down one by one by him and his fellow Cossacks. At
   the end of the battle, though, the sorcerer shoots Danilo dead from
   behind a tree. A desperate Katerina falls asleep at night, has a dream
   about her son being killed, wakes up from the nightmare, and finds the
   baby dead in its cradle.

   Katerina turns mad until a traveler stops at her house one day and
   appears to bring her back to sanity. But when he claims that Danilo
   once told him to marry her should Danilo die, Katerina recognizes him
   as the sorcerer and tries to stab him, but he gets hold of the knife,
   kills her and flees on horseback.

   After the famous impressionist description of the Dnieper (one of the
   most celebrated passages in Russian literature), a miracle happens:
   both the Crimea and the Carpathians become visible from Kiev. As clouds
   clear off towering Mount Krivan, the sorcerer sees a hulking knight
   with a boy on a horse riding down its slopes and grows increasingly
   agitated as the bogatyr gets ever closer. He pleads with a starets at
   the Kiev Monastery of the Caves to help him, but they will not, for the
   sorcerer is already damned, so the sorcerer kills the starets.

   Eventually, the hulking knight catches up with the sorcerer and casts
   him into an abyss where corpses of his ancestors await to eternally
   gnaw on his body. The largest of them is Petro, whose descendants God
   punished for Petro's betrayal and murder of his brother Ivan and Ivan's
   son. The knight and boy appear to be their spirits.
