   In the early twenty-first century, a virus wiped out all but two
   million humans, those surviving having lost the sense of sight. See
   takes place centuries later, where society has found new ways to
   interact, build, hunt, and survive without vision. In the mountains,
   Baba Voss, the chieftain of the Alkenny tribe, takes in and marries a
   woman, Maghra, who comes to the Alkenny seeking shelter. Baba Voss has
   been unable to father children, and the woman is pregnant when she
   first arrives.

   The biological father, Jerlamarel, is an outlaw wanted by the Queen of
   the Kane Dynasty of Kanzua Dam for the heresy of being "sighted" (the
   ability to see). Word spreads of Jerlamarel siring children, prompting
   a witch hunt for Jerlamarel and his offspring. Baba Voss must protect
   his family and his tribe against the Queen's army.

   "Alkenny" and "Kanzua" are alterations of Allegheny and Kinzua,
   real-life locations in present-day western Pennsylvania.
