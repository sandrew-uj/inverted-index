   The time is November, 1831. African American slave Nat Turner sits in a
   Virginia jail awaiting execution for his crimes. Nat led a slave
   rebellion which ended in the deaths of dozens of white people as well
   as many of his own closest friends. Thomas Gray, a smug, oily
   prosecuting attorney, urges Nat to "confess" his crimes and make peace
   with God. Nat begins to think back on his past life and tells the novel
   in a series of flashbacks.

   Nat's first master was Samuel Turner, a wealthy Virginia aristocrat who
   believed in educating his slaves. Nat learned to read and write, and
   also became a skilled carpenter. Unfortunately, when he was still a
   child Nat's mother was brutally raped by an Irish overseer while the
   master was away. This traumatic experience gives Nat both a burning
   hatred of white people and a secret revulsion from women's bodies and
   the sexual act.

   Samuel Turner has vaguely promised Nat his freedom, but through a
   series of misunderstandings Nat is sold instead to an impoverished
   preacher named Reverend Eppes. Eppes is a filthy, drooling homosexual
   who is obsessed with young boys, and he is determined to make Nat
   "pleasure" him at the earliest opportunity. Though Nat is not
   especially interested in young women at this point, he finds Eppes
   physically distasteful and shies away from physical contact.
   Discouraged, Eppes soon sells young Nat to a pair of cruel redneck
   farmers who brutally whip the frightened, timid slave and treat him
   like an animal. This intensifies his growing hostility towards whites.

   After bouncing around different masters for a number of years, Nat
   finally ends up as the property of a decent, hard-working farmer named
   Travis. Travis allows Nat to do skilled work as a carpenter and to read
   his Bible and preach to other slaves. During his religious fasts deep
   in the deserted woods, Nat begins to have strange visions of black and
   white angels fighting in the sky. Gradually he comes to believe these
   visions mean he is to lead the black race in a holy war to destroy all
   whites.

   Complications arise, however, when Nat meets Margaret Whitehead, the
   beautiful, vivacious daughter of a wealthy widow who lives nearby.
   Though her family owns many slaves, high-spirited Margaret opposes
   slavery and openly admires Nat's preaching. Gradually the two of them
   become friends, though Nat is haunted by the fear that if his plans
   succeed lovely Margaret must die.

   With several loyal slaves behind him, Nat finally launches his
   rebellion in late August 1831. This is a time when most wealthy whites
   are away on vacation, which will make it easier for the slaves to seize
   weapons and attack the nearby town of Jerusalem. From the very
   beginning, however, Nat's rebellion goes all wrong. His recruits get
   drunk and waste precious time plundering and raping. A crazed,
   axe-wielding, sex-obsessed slave named Will begins ridiculing Nat's
   leadership and attempting to seize control of the tiny slave army. And
   Nat himself, unexpectedly sickened by the sight of blood and the
   screams of his white victims, begins to doubt both his own mission and
   God's plan for his life.

   The final crisis occurs as the slaves storm the Whitehead plantation.
   In a tragic twist, Margaret and her sisters have not gone away on
   vacation after all. Filled with unreasoning hatred, Will the
   axe-wielding maniac slays all the white women but Margaret, openly
   taunting Nat and daring him to prove his black manhood to the rest of
   the recruits. With a heavy heart, Nat grabs his sword and chases
   Margaret into a nearby field, where he slays her with great reluctance.
   As the breath leaves her body, the pure young maiden sighs her
   forgiveness for her unwilling executioner.

   Back in the jail cell, lawyer Gray smugly announces that the hangman is
   ready to punish Nat for his crimes. As he concludes their final
   interview, he asks the failed black leader if he has any regrets for
   having caused so much suffering and death.
