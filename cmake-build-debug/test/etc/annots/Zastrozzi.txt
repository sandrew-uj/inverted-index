   Pietro Zastrozzi, an outlaw, and his two servants, Bernardo and Ugo,
   disguised in masks, abduct Verezzi from the inn near Munich where he
   lives and take him to a cavern hideout. Verezzi is locked in a room
   with an iron door. Chains are placed around his waist and limbs and he
   is attached to the wall.

   Verezzi is able to escape and to flee his abductors, running away to
   Passau in Lower Bavaria. Claudine, an elderly woman, allows Verezzi to
   stay at her cottage. Verezzi saves Matilda from jumping off of a
   bridge. She befriends him. Matilda seeks to persuade Verezzi to marry
   her. Verezzi, however, is in love with Julia. Matilda provides lodging
   for Verezzi at her castle or mansion estate near Venice. Her tireless
   efforts to seduce him are unsuccessful.

   Zastrozzi concocts a plan to torture and to torment Verezzi. He spreads
   a false rumour that Julia has died, exclaiming to Matilda: "Would Julia
   of Strobazzo's heart was reeking on my dagger!" Verezzi is convinced
   that Julia is dead. Distraught and emotionally shattered, he then
   relents and offers to marry Matilda.

   The truth is revealed that Julia is still alive. Verezzi is so
   distressed at his betrayal that he kills himself. Matilda kills Julia
   in retaliation. Zastrozzi and Matilda are arrested for murder. Matilda
   repents. Zastrozzi, however, remains defiant before an inquisition. He
   is tried, convicted, and sentenced to death.

   Zastrozzi confesses that he sought revenge against Verezzi because
   Verezzi's father had deserted his mother, Olivia, who died young,
   destitute, and in poverty. Zastrozzi blamed his father for the death of
   his mother, who died before she was thirty. Zastrozzi sought revenge
   against not only his own father, whom he murdered, but also against
   "his progeny for ever", his son Verezzi. Verezzi and Zastrozzi had the
   same father. By murdering his own father, Zastrozzi only killed his
   corporeal body. By manipulating Verezzi into committing suicide,
   however, Zastrozzi confessed that his objective was to achieve the
   eternal damnation of Verezzi's soul based on the proscription of the
   Christian religion against suicide. Zastrozzi, an outspoken atheist,
   goes to his death on the rack rejecting and renouncing religion and
   morality "with a wild convulsive laugh of exulting revenge".
