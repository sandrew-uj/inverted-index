   A tribe of primitive humans lives in a barren, rocky wasteland and
   struggle for survival, despite a lush, plant-filled land on the other
   side of a nearby river. They refuse to cross the river because of a law
   that evolved from an ancient tale warning of a god lurking there who
   brings death with a single touch.

   A young man of the tribe challenges the law and is eventually followed
   by other male members of his tribe, who fearfully cross the river in
   order to bring him back. They soon encounter the terrible god, a large,
   horribly burned but strangely human-like creature. Despite the young
   man's peace overture to the god, another tribal member, out of fear,
   lays a trap and stones the creature to death with a large rock; the
   young man then shoots and kills that tribesman with one of his arrows.
   The others gather around the now-dead god and discover that the
   creature is actually a much older man with long white hair. He is
   wearing some kind of strange, unknown outer garment with a fearful
   hood. They find another strange thing in the old man's possession; they
   are puzzled by this flat, thick object that opens and contains
   mysterious markings and vivid black, white and gray images that show an
   even stranger human world unknown to them.

   In a surprising denouement provided by the old man after his death, the
   truth is revealed in voice-over as the tribesmen page through his book:
   He was actually a survivor of a long-ago nuclear holocaust, forced to
   live for decades inside his now-ragged, discolored and bulky radiation
   suit (which is implied to have once been covered with deadly
   radioactive fallout). The old man has wandered the land for decades,
   while the primitive remnants of a devastated human race have slowly
   increased their numbers; his frightening outer appearance caused them
   to fear and shun him.

   A final, cautionary question is asked in voice-over by the old man:
   will humanity someday repeat its nuclear folly after civilization has
   once again risen to its former heights?
