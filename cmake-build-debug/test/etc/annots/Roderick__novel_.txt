   The title character is an intelligent robot, the first to be invented.
   The opening chapters describe the creation of Roderick and show his
   mind (at first consisting of a bodiless computer program) developing
   through several stages of awareness. Finally, Roderick is given a
   rudimentary body and, through a series of misadventures, finds himself
   alone in the world. Due to his sketchy understanding of human customs,
   and intrigues surrounding the project that created him, he unwittingly
   becomes the center of various criminal schemes and other unfortunate
   events.
