   The events of the past are told through the diaries of 19th century
   magicians Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden. The diaries are read by
   their great-grandchildren, Kate Angier and Andrew Westley (born
   Nicholas Borden) who meet in the present day, with the two diary
   accounts being interspersed with events of Kate's and Andrew's framing
   story throughout the novel. Andrew's story is related to his childhood,
   being adopted and his current job as a journalist. Kate's story is
   related to a traumatic event that happened when she was five years old
   where she witnessed a small boy murdered by her father. This leads her
   to search for Andrew who she believes is a key to the mystery. Kate
   believes that Andrew was the twin of the boy she witnessed die. As the
   diaries are read, the truth of the what happened to Andrew's twin is
   explained by the history of Angier and Borden.

   The central plot focuses on a feud between the magicians, begun in the
   fledgling years of their careers when Borden disrupts a fake seance
   being conducted by Angier and his wife after having conducted a
   previous one for one of Borden's relatives (Borden was upset that they
   were presenting it as real when he realized it was in truth an
   illusion). During a scuffle, Angier's pregnant wife Julia is thrown to
   the ground, resulting in a miscarriage. The two men are mutually
   antagonistic for many years afterwards as they rise to become
   world-renowned stage magicians, with the feud affecting the later
   generations of their families to come, specifically Kate and Andrew.

   Borden develops a teleportation act called "The Transported Man", and
   later creates an improved version named "The New Transported Man",
   which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the
   blink of an eye without appearing to pass through the intervening
   space. The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous magic acts
   to shame. The reader learns that Alfred Borden is actually not one man
   but two: identical twins named Albert and Frederick who share the
   identity of "Alfred Borden" secretly to ensure their professional
   success with "The New Transported Man". Angier suspects that Borden
   uses a double, but dismisses the idea because he thinks it is too easy.

   Angier desperately tries to equal Borden's success. With the help of
   the acclaimed inventor Nikola Tesla, Angier develops an act called "In
   a Flash", which produces a similar result through a starkly different
   method. Tesla's device teleports a human being from one place to
   another by creating an exact physical duplicate at the required
   destination, into which the person's consciousness is instantly
   transmitted thus leaving the original physical subject behind. Because
   of this method, Angier is forced to devise a way to conceal the
   original (in order to preserve the illusion) whenever the trick is
   performed. He clinically refers to these near-lifeless shells in his
   diary as "the prestiges".

   Angier's new act is as successful as Borden's. The infuriated and
   obsessed Borden attempts to discover how "In a Flash" is performed.
   During one performance he breaks into the backstage area and turns off
   the power to Angier's device, mistakenly believing the generator
   powering it is about to catch fire and turn the theatre ablaze. The
   subsequent teleportation is incomplete, and both the duplicated Angier
   and the "prestige" Angier survive as separate persons after this
   incident, but the original feels increasingly weak physically while the
   duplicate seems to lack physical substance. The original "prestige"
   Angier fakes his own death as part of a previous plan to put behind his
   public persona of a magician, and returns as the heir to his family
   estate of Caldlow House without any publicity. While there, he becomes
   terminally ill.

   Angier had discovered Borden's secret as a twin prior to the accident
   that created his duplicate. Now alienated from the world by his ghostly
   form and consumed with thoughts of revenge, the Angier duplicate
   attacks one of the twins before a performance. However, Borden's
   apparent poor health, age and the duplicate Angier's resurgent sense of
   morality prevent the assault from becoming murder. It is implied that
   this particular Borden twin dies a few days later, and the incorporeal
   Angier travels to meet the corporeal Angier, now living as the 14th
   Earl of Colderdale. They come into possession of Borden's diary
   courtesy of a disgruntled third party in need of money, but publish it
   without revealing the twins' secret. Shortly afterwards, the corporeal
   Angier dies and his ghostly duplicate uses Tesla's device one last time
   to teleport himself into the body; hoping that either he will reanimate
   it and become whole again, or kill himself instantly and so reunite
   with his other self in death.

   In the final section of the novel, Kate and Andrew's mystery is
   revealed. Andrew Westley goes into the Angier family vault. He finds
   all of Rupert Angier's near-lifeless shells (the prestiges) labelled
   with the date and place they were created. Andrew also finds a prestige
   of a small boy with the label Nicholas Julius Borden, with his place of
   creation listed as Caldlow House. It is then understood that Andrew
   himself never had a twin. The night Kate witnessed his "death", he had
   actually been cast into the Tesla device by Kate's father and had
   become a physical duplicate of himself. It is also revealed to Kate
   Angier and Andrew Westley that in Caldlow House, some form of Rupert
   Angier has continued to survive to the present day. It appears Angier's
   attempt to become whole again was successful. Angier confirms to
   Andrew, in their brief moment of contact in the vault, that Andrew was
   a physical duplicate of the small boy, just like Angier was a duplicate
   of all the prestiges in the vault.
