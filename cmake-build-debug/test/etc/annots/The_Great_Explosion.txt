   The Blieder drive, a faster-than-light drive system, has permitted the
   population of Earth to colonize the galaxy. Each planet has become the
   home for a particular social group. Four hundred years after the
   diaspora (the "Great Explosion" of the title), a spaceship from Earth
   visits three of the planets, the first steps to unifying the galaxy
   under a new Empire. The ship contains two thousand Terrans including
   many pompous officials, an army of bureaucrats, a military force and
   the ship's crew, including some misfits. Things do not go entirely as
   hoped, as the incompetent military authoritarians of the ship encounter
   three very different societies.

   The first planet was a penal colony; it is now many independent
   kleptocratic despotisms preying on each other. The second planet,
   Hygeia, is populated by health and fitness fanatic nudists. The third
   planet, Kassim, was colonized by a religious group, but when the ship
   arrives, the Terrans cannot find any human life, only empty villages
   overgrown by jungle. They decide not to land on the planet, because the
   captain fears that the colonists could have been killed by a disease
   and he doesn't want to endanger the crew. The final planet, K22g, has
   developed an unusual social system. The population call themselves
   Gands (after Gandhi) and practise a form of classless, philosophically
   anarchic libertarianism, based on passive resistance ("Freedom - I
   won't!" and "Myob!"); and a moneyless gift economy based on barter and
   favor-exchange, using "obs" (obligations). To perform a service for
   somebody "lays an ob" on them; they can then "kill the ob" by returning
   the favor.^[1] As the planet's population are demonstrably non-hostile,
   the officials have to approve shore leave, which brings the crew into
   contact with the anarchist natives. Many find reasons to stay on the
   planet, refusing to return to the ship. The officials have to get the
   ship back into space before they lose so many that the ship will never
   fly again.
