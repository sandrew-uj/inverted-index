   The Dead begins a year before the events in The Enemy, where an unnamed
   user posts a video on YouTube titled "The Scared Kid". In it, a boy
   frantically talks to the camera about how his friends Danny and Eve
   have been killed by "Mothers and fathers" (Zombies), and shows them
   standing outside his window. He then suffers a nervous breakdown and
   ends the video. The video goes viral, with people not knowing if it is
   real or not. Eventually, the video is taken down from YouTube, followed
   by the site itself, followed by the internet, and finally electricity
   entirely. This marks the point that people realized that something bad
   was going on, and the start of the apocalypse.

   Two weeks into the apocalypse, two 14-year-old boys, named Jack and Ed
   are trapped with a group of other schoolboys in the Rowhurst boarding
   school (in Kent, in a remote village a few miles from London) where
   they are defending themselves from their now zombified teachers. After
   escaping from the adult siege of their school with the help of a rugby
   player named Bam, Jack and Ed rescue their French teacher's daughter,
   Frederique, and make their way to a nearby chapel, where a group of
   people led by a boy named Matt barricaded themselves inside a few days
   prior. Alarmed by the lack of a reply from inside the church, they
   break in and find that the boys hiding inside have either fallen
   unconscious or died from carbon monoxide poisoning. The group of boys
   manage to revive the survivors, and Matt appears to have suffered brain
   damage from the poisoning. He believes himself to be the messenger of a
   being called the Lamb, who he explains will come down to earth and
   cleanse it of "Non believers" (the zombies). He is convinced he must go
   to St Paul's Cathedral in London to fulfil the needs of his "god". The
   group splits, with Matt and some people he has brought into his
   religion (now calling themselves his "acolytes", attempting to go to
   London with Jack (who wants to find his family home), and the rest
   (including Ed, Bam and one of Ed's best friends Malik) deciding to go
   deeper into the countryside (thinking it will be safer).

   Ed's group is ambushed by older, infected teenagers shortly after
   parting from the rest, who kill half the group, including Malik. They
   are saved by the timely arrival of a motor coach driven by an adult
   named Greg Thorne, a butcher who claims he is immune to the disease.
   With his young son Liam, Greg has acquired a bus and is collecting
   children to transport them all to London. He and Liam want to visit
   Arsenal Stadium, unaware that it is an adult nest (as revealed in The
   Enemy). On the bus, Ed's group meet three girls, Aleisha, Courtney and
   Brooke. Brooke immediately develops a crush on Ed, whilst Greg
   eventually catches up with Jack, Matt, and the Lamb of God believers,
   who are all still journeying towards London.

   After finding the others and picking them up, Greg explains that,
   before the epidemic, he was staying with a farmer and his family, but
   he had had to kill the father and the older children. He says a younger
   child, who'd gone crazy after losing his family, "didn't make it",
   indirectly revealing that he had killed the boy and made him into the
   dried meat he was seen eating, but which Liam refused. After a close
   call where Greg nearly leaves Jack and Frederique behind to a group of
   zombies, the bus stops for the night on the outskirts of London. Liam
   finds out that Greg is infected, and knowing that he cannot protect him
   any more, Greg strangles and kills him.

   The next morning, Ed finds Greg inexplicably wearing Liam's glasses.
   Jack and Ed confront Greg about Liam's death. This causes him to
   succumb to the virus, which is revealed after Jack, who gets mad at the
   discovery, attempts to disarm a shotgun that Greg is wielding. The
   arm-to-the-face maneuver that he inflicted causes Greg to lose control,
   and crash the bus, which he was driving erratically due to succumbing
   to the disease, and out of anger wanted to get everyone on board to
   their destination. Afterward, he completely succumbs to the virus and
   attack the kids, whilst the bus is simultaneously assaulted by several
   adults. Most of the group escapes from the bus except for a boy Piers
   who was already injured and makes it to the Imperial War Museum in
   South London. Greg wanders off into the streets of London, whilst the
   "Bus Party" meets the museum's leader, Jordan, and his second in
   command DogNut (who develops a crush on Brooke). Jordan refuses to let
   them stay, eventually compromising and letting them stay as long as
   they collect food for themselves.

   A group sets off, and they explore until they find a Tesco truck full
   of non-perishable food, with a partially decomposed corpse inside.
   Whilst they are attempting to get the truck to run, Frederique is
   surrounded by several adults. The other kids fight off the adults and
   are surprised to find that Frederique is unharmed. Whilst they are
   driving the truck back to the museum, Jack and Bam tell Ed that they
   are planning on going to Jack's old house (like Jack said before) and
   hop out to go off on their own. Ed eventually decides to join them,
   kisses Brooke and catches up with the two boys, unaware that they are
   being followed by a now fully zombified Greg.

   Meanwhile, Matt's religion has gained more believers. They rename the
   religion Agnus Dei (Latin for "Lamb of God"). Matt foretells that the
   Lamb will look like a blond boy and will have a darker shadow (another
   boy, nicknamed "The Goat"), who must be sacrificed so that "The lamb
   has no shadow" and is capable of cleansing the earth. The new religion
   attempts to make a banner, but the maker misspells Agnus Dei as "Angus
   Day", leading to the religion being renamed again. Also at the museum,
   Frederique attacks a young boy named Froggie, biting into his arm. She
   reveals that she is 16 years old to Ed, after he meets her, and is
   infected, but her disease took longer to manifest than it did for
   others. Several of Jordan's kids lock her in a storeroom.

   Jack, Ed, and Bam make their way to the Oval Cricket Ground, finding
   dozens of ambulances, military trucks, police cars, and skips outside
   filled with dead bodies. Despite Ed's hesitation, Bam and Jack kill two
   soldiers and an policeman. The boys explore, finding and keeping
   several weapons. They find that the entire stadium is full of diseased
   corpses that were stacked to be burned, as well as numerous bodies
   seated in the stands, but the law enforcement and medical officials
   were themselves killed or succumbed to the infection before they had a
   chance to finish the job. The boys learn not all the bodies are dead
   and are then pursued by adults through the stadium. Jack accidentally
   shoots a propane tank with a submachine gun whilst trying to fend off
   an attacker, causing it to explode and setting off an avalanche of
   corpses. Ed is buried underneath the bodies whilst Jack and Bam are
   buried underneath the debris resulting from a partially collapsed
   section of the stadium. Bam mistakes Jack for an adult and shoots him
   with the shotgun that he had recovered from Greg. Jack is badly wounded
   in the side, but able to stand. Ed finds them, and the three boys
   leave, continuing their trek to Jack's house.

   In the street, they are ambushed by adults whom the three boys manage
   to kill, but as they do a victory dance for killing the rather large
   group (as revealed by the book), Greg appears and kills Bam with a meat
   cleaver to the head. In the book, its noted that Greg was seen before
   far off, but the boys couldn't identify him. They therefore dismiss
   him. He then slashes Jack's chest open and cuts the side of Ed's face
   from forehead to chin. Greg is about to finish off Ed, but Greg flees,
   wailing with horror when Ed mentions Liam's name aloud, upon seeing
   that the bundle in Greg's other hand was Liam's body. Ed drags a fading
   Jack to his home and tries to heal his friend's wounds. However, Jack
   is beyond repair. Ed takes Jack to his bedroom and keeps him company
   throughout the night with him. In the morning, Ed finds Jack has died
   from his injuries. Ed cremates his friend by burning the entire house
   down, and heads back to the museum under a spreading cloud of smoke and
   ash emanating from a large fire they'd seen earlier in South London.

   Soon, Ed is ambushed again by adults, only to be rescued by David and
   his group (before they took residence at Buckingham Palace). Together,
   they all travel to the museum. David warns Ed that the fire is
   spreading northward, towards the museum, and the museum group should
   relocate. At the museum, Ed manages to stitch his cheek, leaving him
   with a large scar. He confronts Frederique, who has escaped captivity
   by gnawing off her own thumb to slip out of her handcuffs. Ed defeats
   her and, against Jordan's advice to kill her so she won't kill someone
   else, manages to banish her into the streets. Ed holds council with
   David and Jordan, with Ed and David deciding to move to North London
   away from the oncoming fire. Jordan decides to stay in the museum with
   his original group.

   Ed and David make a deal: in exchange for receiving food from the Tesco
   truck, on which Ed's group will ride, David's group will accompany the
   truck on foot, clearing the congestion and debris blocking the truck's
   path. Armed with additional weapons from the museum, Ed and David lead
   their respective kids, and attempt to cross north across the River
   Thames via the Lambeth Bridge, fleeing the rapidly spreading fire.
   Every other kid in South London is also trying to cross the river, and
   they all struggle to do so due to congestion and a commotion between
   kids further up the bridge. A huge wave of infected adults comes up
   behind the kids from the south, and Ed and several other fighters
   including Courtney and Aleisha hang back to fend off the infected
   whilst Brooke and the others drive on without knowing they are leaving
   them behind. Brooke decides to split off from David's group after she
   sees him shoot a boy in the chest. Frederique reappears and attacks
   Aleisha, injuring her, resulting in Ed shooting Frederique dead with a
   pistol, after she "reverts" to human upon recognizing Ed. Ed is helped
   by another boy named Kyle, and although the fighters initially seem to
   be overwhelmed, they are rescued by Jordan, DogNut and their his crew,
   who had been forced to abandon the museum by adults and the fire.

   The fighters flee, but the way back to the bridge is blocked by a horde
   of adults. The kids manage to take control of a sightseeing cruise boat
   moored in the river. They pilot it downstream towards the Tower of
   London, but Matt hijacks the boat in an attempt to reach St Paul's
   Cathedral. He accidentally crashes the boat into the bridge, and it
   splits in half, causing a number of kids to drown, including Aleisha.
   Matt and his surviving acolytes are last seen disappearing under a
   bridge, standing on the top of half of the ruined boat, whilst Matt
   holds the banner above his head.

   Jordan, Ed, Kyle, and the survivors find lifeboats and navigate them to
   the river's north bank. They make their way to the Tower of London and
   enter it by climbing the drainpipes. Inside, they find a group of about
   30 kids already inhabiting the castle. Frustrated with the current
   leader, Jordan takes control, with Ed as his right-hand man. Of the
   original group from the bus, only Ed and Courtney remain. The others
   are either dead, missing, or still with the Tesco truck. Greg finds
   himself in Trafalgar Square, where he has lost his shirt. He puts on a
   St. George T-shirt from a souvenir stand and decides to get revenge on
   those he holds responsible for Liam's death. It is also revealed that
   he intends to raise an army of adults, revealing him as the "Saint
   George" adult from the previous novel (The Enemy).

   One year later, DogNut decides to leave the Tower with a group of
   people, including Courtney, to search for Brooke and the other kids. A
   few days after this, Ed, Kyle, and Jordan witness Small Sam and the Kid
   arrive at the tower (as shown in "The Enemy"), and are shocked to find
   that they look identical to the Lamb and the Goat children on the Angus
   Day banner.
