   Twelve is the story of 17-year-old White Mike, the privileged son of a
   restaurant tycoon. His mother succumbed to breast cancer several years
   before the novel began. White Mike is a drug dealer who has taken his
   senior year in high school off to sell marijuana to his wealthy peers.
   When he is not selling drugs he is reminiscing of his childhood and
   philosophizing about a world he feels he is not a part of.

   The novel takes place over a five-day period in December 1999,
   beginning on the night of the 27th and ending on New Year's Eve. It is
   told in a 3rd person narrative and follows not just White Mike but many
   other characters, but despite this White Mike is the central figure in
   the book.

   Part 1 -- December 27

   The novel begins with White Mike thinking about his deceased mother and
   musing about the state of New York in the Winter. He then visits the
   rec center, where Hunter, a friend of his has gotten into a fight with
   a black basketball player named Nana. The fight ends with both covered
   in copious amounts of each other's blood. White Mike and Hunter head to
   a nearby Goody's, where they discuss college. White Mike then leaves to
   make a sale.

   Hunter then leaves and goes home, thinking about the fight with Nana
   while listening to James Taylor on his discman. At home he makes
   sporadic conversation with his father, who is quite wealthy and a
   borderline alcoholic. Hunter then leaves the apartment and goes for a
   walk.

   The narrative then shifts to Nana, who is going home to his apartment
   in the Harlem housing projects. Before he can get into his building he
   witnesses a drug deal between two shady characters, a pale white boy
   and a heavy black man. The deal then erupts into violence when the
   heavy man shoots the pale boy with a gun wrapped in a hand towel. Nana
   tries to escape but is killed as well by the heavy man, who pockets the
   pale boy's revolver before fleeing the scene.

   We then shift to Sara Ludlow, the "hottest girl in school" and her
   girlfriends as they head to a party. They discuss school and their
   friends.

   White Mike is at the party. He sells some pot to Chris, the boy
   throwing the party, but declines Chris's invitation to come in. After
   wondering how smart Sara Ludlow is, he leaves, musing about how rich
   everyone is.

   We then meet Chris, the boy throwing the party, a 17-year-old boy
   desperate to lose his virginity. There is an overview of the party and
   we then meet Jessica, a school mate of Sara and Chris who heads to the
   bathroom to do some cocaine. Instead of cocaine she does a drug given
   to her by a boy. The drug is called Twelve. She takes some and is
   overwhelmed by the high that follows. She compares it to the first time
   she read The Gettysburg Address before passing out.

   The narrative shifts to Claude, Chris's brother, and Tobias, a male
   model, taking a trip through China Town. They smoke some pot together
   and then buy bladed weapons at a shop. Claude takes home his weapons
   and arranges them in his closet, all in perfect order like some private
   shrine.

   Part 2 -- December 28

   The corpses of Nana and the pale boy are found. After talking with some
   boys who witnessed the fight at the rec center, two detectives place
   Hunter under arrest because of the blood still on his clothes.

   Jessica wakes up and heads to the skating rink with some girlfriends.
   Once there, she accidentally injures a boy named Andrew by cutting his
   forehead with her skate. Andrew is taken to the hospital and the girls
   leave the rink. Jessica calls Chris and asks for White Mike's phone
   number, telling him that she wants more of the drug she had the party,
   Twelve.

   At the hospital, Andrew undergoes surgery and is placed in a room for
   an overnight stay. He is placed in the same room as Sean, the high
   school football star who happens to be Sara Ludlow's boyfriend. Sean
   was involved in a car accident. Sara arrives to visit him and strikes
   up a conversation with Andrew. Andrew loans her his Dave Matthews Band
   CD, thinking it will make a good excuse to see her again.

   Sara then goes to see Chris. She asks him to host another, bigger party
   on New Year's Eve, since his parents are out of town. Chris is
   apprehensive, but Sara tempts him with sexual favors so he gives in.

   White Mike meets Jessica with Lionel, a mysterious drug dealer who
   supplies Mike with Marijuana. Lionel sells the Twelve to Jessica, who
   asks for Lionel's beeper number in case she wants more; Lionel gives
   her the number.

   White Mike and Lionel then converse about Charlie, White Mike's cousin
   who got him into drug dealing and is away at College. It is revealed
   here that Lionel killed Charlie and Nana. He tells White Mike he has
   not seen Charlie, and departs.

   Tobias heads to a shoot at the modelling agency. There he meets Molly,
   a fellow model who he is interested in. He takes Molly to Chris and
   Claude's where he is keeping his flesh-eating piranhas. After showing
   her the fish, he invites her to the New Year's Eve party and she
   agrees.

   Hunter is placed under arrest for the murders of Nana and Charlie since
   the blood on his clothes is verified as Nana's. He finds he does not
   have an alibi.

   Chris and Claude go to a cocktail party hosted by their aunt. Chris
   converses with a wannabe-author friend of his aunt's about The Beatles
   and Eminem.

   After the party Claude returns to China Town with Tobias and illegally
   buys an Uzi submachine gun from one of the shops.

   Part 3 -- December 29

   Chris is having a boxing lesson when Sara shows up, requesting money
   for some Twelve which she will give to Jessica. Chris reluctantly gives
   her the money.

   Molly visits White Mike, who is a good friend of hers even though she
   is unaware of his "profession". She tells him about Tobias and the
   party. White Mike gently tries to dissuade her from going.

   Andrew is bored so he goes for a walk and ends up in Carl Schurz park
   where he meets and eccentric old man named Sven. He plays a game of
   chess with Sven, who beats him. Andrew feels he is being insulted by
   Sven and tries to leave, but Sven insists on taking him to a nearby pub
   for a drink. He does. At the bar, Andrew and Sven drink Scotch and
   Sodas and discuss school and Sven's old life as a merchant sailor.
   Feeling weirded out, Andrew leaves.

   White Mike is walking home and sees Captain, a homeless bodybuilding
   black man, injuring himself by hitting a brick wall and calls an
   ambulance.

   Part 4 -- December 30

   That morning, Andrew calls Sara under the guise of getting his CD back.
   She invites him to Chris's party and asks him to bring weed. Andrew
   does not smoke pot but decides to score some anyway.

   We are then introduced to Timmy and Mark Rothko, two unlikely wanna-be
   "cool kids" who get their kicks stealing CDs, smoking weed and speaking
   in an exaggerated hip-hop vernacular. They contact White Mike with the
   intent of buying some weed.

   White Mike has a phone conversation with an old friend of his and
   Hunter's, Warren, and then decides to take a train ride down to Coney
   Island.

   The perspective shifts to Sean, who has to go to the hospital for a
   check-up on his broken arm. He takes a taxi and is annoyed by the
   driver.

   White Mike goes to Coney Island and observes people. Back on the train
   he gets the call from Timmy and Mark Rothko.

   Jessica wakes up and watches the talk shows. She enjoys watching the
   "dregs of humanity" on television and holds a fake talk show with her
   stuffed animals in which she comments on a fictional school massacre.
   Here we are given the impression that Jessica may not be all there.

   Timmy and Mark Rothko stop to buy cigarette usings a fake I.D. It fails
   and they threaten the store clerk, who in turn pulls an empty revolver
   on them. They leave all too quickly.

   Jessica has lunch with her mother, who advises she visits a
   psychiatrist. She reluctantly agrees and wonders what she will tell her
   psychiatrist.

   White Mike sells some weed to Timmy and Mark Rothko, who both irritate
   and amuse him with their lifestyle.

   In jail, Hunter finally contacts his father through Andrew's father.
   Hunter tells his father he is frightened. Hunter's father remembers an
   incident that happened when he was in school, when a boy died at a
   drunken fireside party.

   White Mike meets Andrew at the amphitheatre and sells him weed. White
   Mike is curious as to why Andrew is buying it. Andrew tells him it is
   for a girl.

   Part 5 -- New Year's Eve

   Andrew wakes up and decides to get a haircut. He does, then at home
   decides he looks bad. He decides to go to the party and resolves to get
   himself drunk.

   Chris goes out and buys toiletries and condoms, thinking that tonight
   will be the night that he loses his virginity. He goes home and throws
   out his collection of pornography.

   Timmy and Mark Rothko call White Mike for more weed. They follow him to
   his house, much to his annoyance. He gives them their weed and they
   talk about birds. Mark Rothko and Timmy then go to the supermarket and
   smash a container of Marshmallow fluff. White Mike receives a call from
   his dad telling him Charlie is dead. White Mike breaks down and wonders
   who could have done it. Jessica prepares for the party and to score
   more Twelve.

   At the party, Jessica gives her cell phone to a girl who beeps White
   Mike for weed. White Mike rushes over.

   Andrew and Molly meet in the kitchen and grow closer, deciding to head
   out for pizza when Lionel arrives.

   Lionel and Jessica go upstairs and she realises she does not have
   enough for a bag. She offers to have sex with Lionel in exchange.

   White Mike arrives at the party and in a fit of rage trashes the house
   stereo. He punches Chris when Chris attempts to kick him out.

   He bursts in on Lionel and Jessica, who are having sex. Lionel pulls
   Charlie's revolver, which he took from the murder scene, on White Mike.
   White Mike realises Lionel killed Charlie and attacks him, only to be
   shot.

   The gunshot causes Claude to snap, and he leaves his room armed with
   his submachine gun and sword. He goes on a rampage, killing many of the
   partygoers including Mark Rothko, Timmy, Andrew and Molly. After
   charging through the house, he steps outside and opens fire on the
   police, who fatally shoot him on the spot.

   An afterword by White Mike explains that he underwent surgery for his
   wound and survived. It also states that Hunter was cleared of all
   charges after the bullets from Lionel's gun were examined. He also
   explains that he is now studying in Paris and that he likes it better
   than New York.
