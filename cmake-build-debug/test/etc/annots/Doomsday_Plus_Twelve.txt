   In 1988, an incident in Saudi Arabia touches off World War III between
   the United States and the Soviet Union. Things get out of hand and
   nuclear weapons are used; U.S. deaths number 120 million. The effects
   of EMP, ozone, and epidemics (California was dusted with anthrax) are
   depicted.

   Twelve years later people living in a rural Oregon have survived with
   their only contact with the outside world coming from Japanese
   merchants who have built a base near them. They are later, however,
   visited by representatives from San Diego, one of the few U.S. cities
   to survive the war. The visitors preach their plan to restore the
   United States by driving out the Japanese with a nuclear submarine that
   survived the war and ask for volunteers to join their army. Most people
   are not interested in their message but when the militants launch an
   attack on the Japanese merchant base it inspires a trek to San Diego
   led by a charismatic young girl to peacefully protest their actions.

   On the way they meet various groups of survivors: a gang of Hells
   Angels bikers who join up with them, monks living in a still
   functioning observatory, and refugees in the desert living in abandoned
   military vehicles.

   When they arrive in San Diego they find the city in ruins (the missile
   that was supposed to hit exploded in the ocean causing a tsunami that
   destroyed the city). They peacefully march into the base discovering
   that the militants were too afraid of their own soldiers to provide
   them with ammo and the nuclear submarine they boasted about had long
   since sunk to the ocean floor.
