   The novel is narrated by the protagonist Jack Forman, an unemployed
   software programmer taking the role of a house husband. His wife Julia
   serves as a high ranking executive at a nanorobotics company called
   Xymos, and claims to be working on a new revolutionary imaging
   technology, which takes up most of her time. She grows distant to Jack
   and her family, and he believes she is having an affair.

   One night, Julia shows Jack a video of the Xymos nanobots being put
   into a human test subject. Jack is impressed, but becomes more
   suspicious when he notices the video was not made on the day she
   claimed.

   Later in the night, their baby Amanda awakens in agony as her body
   turns red. Jack takes her to the hospital, but the doctors cannot
   identify the cause of her pain. She is given an MRI, and suddenly her
   pain stops and the skin changes disappear. Bewildered, Jack returns
   home to a strangely indifferent Julia who leaves in a hurry, claiming
   to go on an urgent business trip.

   Strange events lead Jack to suspect something bigger is going on: their
   son Eric claims he saw "silver men" cleaning the house in the middle of
   the night; Jack finds a strange device underneath Amanda's bed; memory
   chips on their son's MP3 player turn to dust; Julia becomes abusive to
   her family, and is seen driving with an unidentifiable passenger. Julia
   is injured in a car crash, and Jack is recruited to consult at Xymos,
   as the project manager, Ricky, is having issues with the nanobots.

   Jack is taken to the Xymos research facility in Nevada's Basin Desert,
   where he is given a tour of the lab, meets the programming team, and is
   shown a machine used to make the nanobot assemblers from bacteria,
   though Ricky refuses to show the source code for the nanobots. Ricky
   later claims that contractors improperly installed filters in a vent,
   which caused assemblers, bacteria, and nanobots to be blown into the
   desert, evolving and forming autonomous swarms. These swarms appear to
   be clouds of solar-powered self-sufficient nanobots, reproducing and
   evolving (necroevolution) rapidly. The swarms exhibit predatory
   behavior, killing animals in the wild, using code that Jack himself
   worked on. Most alarmingly, the swarm possess rudimentary intelligence,
   the ability to quickly learn and innovate. Jack also learns that Julia
   helped make the swarms more benign, but they regressed when she left.
   The swarms wander around the plant during the day, but leave when
   strong winds blow or night falls.

   The nanoswarm kills a rabbit outside the complex, and Jack goes outside
   with Mae to inspect; they find that the rabbit died of suffocation, as
   the nanobots blocked its bronchial tubes. Jack is attacked by the
   swarms, and barely manages to get through the airlock into the lab
   before falling unconscious from anaphylactic shock.

   Persuaded by Jack, the team decides to destroy the swarm, fearing a
   grey goo plague that could endanger humanity. They believe the swarm
   must have nested in the desert, and attempt to find the nest by tagging
   the bots with radioactive isotopes and following them at night. Under
   the cover of a strong wind, the team goes to a storage shack to find
   the isotopes and build a spray device. As the wind dies down, four
   swarms attack the shack and kill David and Rosie. The rest of the team
   are forced to take shelter in parked cars.

   Jack and Mae manage to escape to the lab, but Charley falls unconscious
   outside his car. When the others refuse to help, Jack manages to get
   himself and the semi-conscious Charley to safety.

   As night falls, Jack, Mae, and Bobby set out to find the swarms. While
   searching, they discover that the swarms are moving the now deceased
   Rosie through the desert. The team is also shocked to discover that the
   swarms can replicate the physical features, perceptions, and motions of
   humans when they see the swarms form replicas of Ricky, David, and
   Rosie.

   The group follows the body to find the swarms nesting in a cave. A
   Xymos helicopter arrives and wards off the swarms using its draft. Mae
   and Jack then venture into the cave and exterminate the swarms, their
   nest, and their organic assembly plant using explosive thermite caps.

   Returning to the plant, Jack, Mae, and Bobby are greeted by Julia, who
   had discharged herself from the hospital and was brought in by the
   chopper. Julia's behavior is extremely aberrant; she seems to pay heed
   to nothing except enticing Jack and kissing him, even when Charley is
   found killed by a swarm in a sabotaged communications room. Jack cannot
   understand how the swarm got inside the airtight building, why Charley
   would have disabled the facility's communications, or why Julia and
   Ricky are acting very out-of-character.

   Mae discovers security footage of when they were in the desert. To
   Jack's horror, the video reveals that Julia and Ricky had an affair,
   and shows Charley engaging in a vicious fight with Ricky and Vince. All
   of them end up in the communications room where Julia kisses a subdued
   Charley, injecting a swarm into his mouth, while Ricky sabotages the
   communication systems.

   Eventually, Jack and Mae realize that everyone in the facility except
   themselves have been infected by a symbiotic version of the nanobot
   swarms. These nanobots do not show aggressive predatory behavior.
   Instead, the nanobots slowly devour and take over their hosts to
   produce more nanobots, and affect their decision making. The bots then
   control them, allowing them to travel and contaminate others.

   Jack comes up with a plan to destroy this new strain. Mae and Jack
   drink vials containing a form of phage that kills the nanobot-producing
   E. coli bacteria and thus would protect them from infection by the
   nanobots. Jack then takes a sample of the phage and plans to pour it
   into the sprinkler system and drench everyone with it. He has Mae alert
   Julia and the infected team, who set out to stop Jack. In the vicious
   struggle that ensues, Jack is captured and thrown into a magnetic
   chamber. Jack feigns surrender when Julia walks in to interrogate him,
   but reactivates the magnetic chamber, remembering the incident with
   Amanda in the MRI. Julia's body disintegrates as a swarm is pulled away
   by the magnetic field to temporarily reveal the real Julia, who has
   been consumed by the parasitic swarm. Before the swarm can repossess
   her body, Julia begs Jack to forgive her, says she loves him, and tells
   him to stop the swarms and save their children, as they have been
   infected too. Motivated, Jack runs to the roof, fights off the infected
   team, and finally manages to place the sample into the sprinkler
   system.

   To prevent the sprinkler system from triggering, Ricky disables the
   plant's safety network. This plays in Jack's favor, as Mae has already
   allowed the phage into the assembly line, causing it to reproduce
   rapidly. The assembly line is rapidly overheating because of the
   de-activated safety system. If Ricky and Julia don't turn on the safety
   system, the assembly line will burst, filling the lab with the phage.
   The infected, now doomed either way, choose to re-activate the network
   and get drenched with the phage. Jack and Mae escape the facility in a
   helicopter shortly before the facility explodes due to a methane gas
   leak combined with thermite Mae has placed in the building.

   After returning home, Jack doses his children and sister with the
   phage. Mae calls the U.S. Army and sends a sample of the phage to her
   lab.

   Jack puts together all the missing links. The corrosion of the memory
   chips in his home's electronics and Amanda's skin rash were caused by
   nanobot assemblers spread by Julia. The MRI's strong magnetic field
   detached the assemblers from Amanda. Knowing this, Julia called in the
   Xymos special team to scan Amanda's room. The person whom Jack spotted
   in Julia's car was in fact the Ricky-swarm. Xymos had intentionally
   released the swarm into the desert so that it would evolve to stay in a
   cohesive group in the wind, but called him in to destroy the wild
   strain once it became uncontrollable.
