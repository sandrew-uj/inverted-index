   The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels by British
   author C. S. Lewis. Illustrated by Pauline Baynes and originally
   published between 1950 and 1956, The Chronicles of Narnia has been
   adapted for radio, television, the stage, film and computer games. The
   series is set in the fictional realm of Narnia, a fantasy world of
   magic, mythical beasts and talking animals. It narrates the adventures
   of various children who play central roles in the unfolding history of
   the Narnian world. Except in The Horse and His Boy, the protagonists
   are all children from the real world who are magically transported to
   Narnia, where they are sometimes called upon by the lion Aslan to
   protect Narnia from evil. The books span the entire history of Narnia,
   from its creation in The Magician's Nephew to its eventual destruction
   in The Last Battle.

   The Chronicles of Narnia is considered a classic of children's
   literature and is Lewis's best-selling work, having sold over 100
   million copies in 47 languages.
