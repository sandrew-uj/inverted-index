   This book consists of two main plot threads, which only come together
   towards the end of the book.

   A variety of Ringworld hominid species, led by the Machine woman
   Valavirgillin (from The Ringworld Engineers), join together to kill a
   large nest of vampires (the shadow nest) which has been feeding on all
   of them. With the help of two Ghouls, who know that the nest is located
   under an abandoned floating factory, they manage to cast out the
   vampires. The Ghouls find one of the Hindmost's spying devices in the
   factory and transport it all the way to the rim, to ask for help
   against the protectors who rule the rim.

   Meanwhile, Louis Wu decides to die of old age instead of asking the
   Hindmost for rejuvenation, as self-punishment for his helping the
   Hindmost to restabilize the Ringworld at the end of The Ringworld
   Engineers, killing (as he thinks) a trillion hominids to save the rest.
   After ten years of wandering around the Ringworld and aging, the
   Hindmost convinces him that he killed far fewer people than expected.
   Since there are signs of several Protectors on the Ringworld, Louis
   returns to the Hindmost to be restored to health in exchange for
   service, only for the pair of them (along with a Kzin named Acolyte,
   son of Chmeee) to be enslaved by a vampire Protector ("Bram"). Bram
   shoots down ARM and Patriarchy ships attacking the Ringworld, and then
   tries to overthrow the other vampire Protectors who control the rim
   wall. He manages to kill them all, but returns wounded to the control
   center, where he fights and is killed by a Ghoul protector Louis has
   created.
