   Holger Carlsen is an American-trained Danish engineer who joins the
   Danish resistance to the Nazis in World War II. At the shore near
   Elsinore, he is among the group of resistance fighters trying to cover
   the escape to Sweden of an important scientist (evidently the nuclear
   physicist Niels Bohr). With a German force closing in, Carlsen is shot
   and suddenly finds himself transported to a parallel universe, a world
   in which Northern European legend concerning Charlemagne ("The Matter
   of France") is real. This world is divided between the forces of Chaos,
   inhabiting the "Middle World" (which includes Faerie), and the forces
   of Law based in the human world, which is in turn divided between the
   Holy Roman Empire and the Saracens. He finds the equipment and horse of
   a medieval knight waiting for him. The shield is emblazoned with three
   hearts and three lions. He finds that the clothes and armor fit him
   perfectly, and he knows how to use the weapons and ride the horse as
   well as speak fluently the local language, a very archaic form of
   French.

   Seeking to return to his own world, Holger is joined by Alianora, a
   swan maiden, and Hugi, a dwarf. They are induced to follow the
   seemingly attractive elvish Duke Alfric of Faerie, who in fact plots to
   imprison Holger in Elf Hill, where time runs differently. Holger learns
   that Morgan Le Fay, his lover in a forgotten past life, is his ultimate
   adversary.

   They escape and, after encountering a dragon, a giant, and a werewolf,
   reach the town of Tarnberg, where they are joined by the mysterious
   Saracen, Carahue, who has been searching for Holger. Based on the
   advice of the wizard, Martinus Trismegistus, they set out to recover
   the sword Cortana. The sword is in a ruined church, guarded by a nixie,
   cannibal hillmen, and (most dangerous of all) a troll.

   On the perilous quest, Holger and Alianora fall deeply in love with
   each other. However, Holger avoids physically consummating this love
   though Alianora wants him to as he intends to return to his
   20th-century world. But with the perilous Wild Hunt on their tracks,
   Holger and Alianora pledge their love and he promises, if surviving the
   ordeal ahead, always to remain with her. However, the decision would be
   taken out of his hands.

   Once the sword is recovered, Holger discovers that he is the legendary
   Ogier the Dane, a champion of Law. He vanquishes the forces of Chaos
   and is transported back to his own world, right back to the battle in
   Elsinore and, with a burst of superhuman strength, vanquishes the Nazi
   troops and enables Bohr to escape and play his part in the Manhattan
   Project. Thus, in two worlds, Holger/Ogier has fulfilled his destiny of
   fighting evil forces and preserving Denmark and France. The magical
   forces involved have no consideration for the hero's love life by
   leaving him stranded away from his beloved Alianora. Desperately
   wanting to return to the other world, he seeks clues in old books of
   magic. His enduring affinity with the medieval world in which he met
   her is expressed by a decision to convert to Catholicism.
