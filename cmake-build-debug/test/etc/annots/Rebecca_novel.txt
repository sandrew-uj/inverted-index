   While working as the companion to a rich American woman on holiday in
   Monte Carlo, the unnamed narrator, a naive young woman in her early
   20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, George Fortescue
   Maximilian "Maxim" de Winter, a 42-year-old widower. After a fortnight
   of courtship, she agrees to marry him and, after the wedding and
   honeymoon, accompanies him to his mansion in Cornwall, the beautiful
   estate Manderley.

   Mrs. Danvers, the sinister housekeeper, was profoundly devoted to the
   first Mrs de Winter, Rebecca, who died in a sailing accident about a
   year before Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter met. She continually
   attempts to undermine the narrator psychologically, subtly suggesting
   to her that she will never attain the beauty, urbanity, and charm her
   predecessor possessed. Whenever the narrator attempts to make changes
   at Manderley, Mrs. Danvers describes how Rebecca ran it when she was
   alive. Each time Mrs. Danvers does this, she implies that the narrator
   lacks the experience and knowledge necessary for running an important
   estate. Cowed by Mrs. Danvers' imposing manner and the other members of
   West Country society's unwavering reverence for Rebecca, the narrator
   becomes isolated.

   The narrator is soon convinced that Maxim regrets his impetuous
   decision to marry her and is still deeply in love with the seemingly
   perfect Rebecca. In an attempt to please him, she revives the Manderley
   costume ball, a custom Rebecca had instated, with the help of Mrs.
   Danvers. On her suggestion, the narrator wears a replica of the dress
   shown in a portrait of one of the house's former inhabitants, ignorant
   of the fact that Rebecca had worn the same costume to much acclaim
   shortly before her death. When the narrator enters the hall and Maxim
   sees the dress, he angrily orders her to change.

   Shortly after the ball, Mrs. Danvers reveals her contempt for the
   narrator, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca, and reveals her
   deep, unhealthy obsession with the dead woman. Mrs. Danvers tries to
   get the narrator to commit suicide by encouraging her to jump out of
   the window. However, she is interrupted before the narrator does so by
   the disturbance caused by a nearby shipwreck. A diver investigating the
   wrecked ship's hull's condition also discovers the remains of Rebecca's
   sailing boat, with her decomposed body still on board, despite Maxim
   having identified another body that had washed ashore shortly after
   Rebecca's death.

   This discovery causes Maxim to confess to the narrator that his
   marriage to Rebecca was a sham. Rebecca, Maxim reveals, was a cruel and
   selfish woman who manipulated everyone around her into believing her to
   be the perfect wife and a paragon of virtue. On the night of her death,
   she told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child, which
   she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim's, and he would be
   powerless to stop her. In a rage, Maxim shot her through the heart,
   then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it at
   sea. The narrator thinks little of Maxim's murder confession but is
   relieved to hear that Maxim has always loved her and never Rebecca.

   Rebecca's boat is raised, and it is discovered to have been
   deliberately sunk. An inquest brings a verdict of suicide. However,
   Rebecca's first cousin and lover, Jack Favell, attempts to blackmail
   Maxim, claiming to have proof that she could not have intended suicide
   based on a note she sent to him the night she died. It is revealed that
   Rebecca had had an appointment with a doctor in London shortly before
   her death, presumably to confirm her pregnancy. When the doctor is
   found, he reveals that Rebecca had cancer and would have died within a
   few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her uterus, she
   could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing
   that she would die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Mrs.
   Danvers had said after the inquiry that Rebecca feared nothing except
   dying a lingering death.

   Maxim feels a great sense of foreboding and insists on driving through
   the night to return to Manderley. However, before he comes in sight of
   the house, it is clear from a glow on the horizon and wind-borne ashes
   that it is ablaze.
