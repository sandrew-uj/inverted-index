   Claidi is a teen girl who has been raised as a maid within an isolated
   palace-city called "the House." The main buildings are surrounded by a
   manmade jungle called "the Garden." All this is cut off from the
   outside world by the giant "Wall."

   Claidi steals a journal and begins to record her unhappy existence in
   the House, writing to the reader as if her journal was a long set of
   letters. Amongst the things Claidi notes is the House's residents' fear
   of the world beyond the safety of their Wall, as they believe outside
   is a poisonous land known as "the Waste."

   Life changes for Claidi when a stranger crashes his hot air balloon
   into the Garden. Captured and imprisoned, he is revealed to be a
   handsome young man named Nemian who is clearly of foreign royal blood.
   The House's eldest princess calls upon Claidi and tells the girl that
   she is no ordinary slave, but a child born from a slave father and
   royal mother. The elderly princess requests that Claidi help Nemian
   escape.

   Happy to leave the House, Claidi and Nemian steal away into the Waste.
   They travel on foot until they hitch a ride on a caravan of chariots.
   They arrive in Chariot Town, a place inhabited by people who can speak
   the same language as sheep, and therefore communicate and live as
   equals with their four-legged friends. While Nemian and Claidi's stay
   is pleasant enough, it is ended by bandits who raid the town.

   Claidi and Nemian escape into the Waste once more, but are chased and
   caught by the bandits. However, the leader of the frightening group
   allows our heroes to go on their way unharmed.

   The Sheepers bring Claidi and Nemian to a village where the residents
   worship in a bird cult. In a religious ceremony, the locals offer up
   Claidi as a sacrifice. As Claidi is about to be thrown from a cliff,
   the bandits arrive and save both Claidi and Nemian from their murderous
   hosts.

   Claidi and Nemein begin travelling with the bandits, who call
   themselves the Hulta. It is soon revealed that the Hulta aren't true
   bandits, but instead are a nomadic village of traders. They are led by
   a young man named Argul, who becomes a love interest to Claidi.

   The Hulta arrive in a technologically advanced city called Peshamba. In
   the city Claidi begins to fall in love with Argul. Claidi, however, is
   afraid of being indecisive with love and decides to leave the Hulta.
   She continues travelling with Nemian.

   Nemian and Claidi eventually arrive in his home city, a dark and dreary
   metropolis ruled by the dominating Wolf Tower. The city's ruling family
   has been led to believe Claidi is of royal blood, so she is trained to
   fill the important position of the "Wolf's Paw." The Wolf's Paw is a
   lawmaker who creates orders by methods of dice and books. Claidi soon
   figures out the whole process is non-sensical.

   The Hulta arrive in the city to spirit Claidi away. Claidi is overjoyed
   to see Argul, as she is now positive she truly loves him. Argul reveals
   to Claidi that when they first met, after she and Nemean fled from
   Sheep Town, he gazed into a magical trinket and it showed him that
   Claidi was his one true love. As both are sure of their feelings, Argul
   and Claidi become engaged to be married. Before leaving the city,
   however, Claidi destroys the Wolf's Paw's tools, effectively ending
   that method of law making.

   As Argul, Claidi, and the Hulta ride away from the city, fireworks
   begin to go off. The people of the city, Claidi realises, are
   celebrating the end of the repressive laws.
