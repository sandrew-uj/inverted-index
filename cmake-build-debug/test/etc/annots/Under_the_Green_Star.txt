   One night the narrator sees a green star in the night sky, and casts
   his soul towards it. He finds a cloud-covered planet which revolves
   around it and sees that its surface is covered with trees that (from
   his perspective) seem several miles high. Later, he follows a retinue
   of humans riding on horse-sized (based on humans retaining earthly
   size, as he explains at one later point in the novel and another later
   in the series) dragonflies (which he finds out later are known as
   zaiphs) to a splendid city which sparkles like a jewel collection. One
   of the men in the retinue, cruel-faced and clad in bright yellow,
   presents a proposal (which the author cannot yet hear) to the ruler of
   the city, a princess who looks about 14.

   At that point, the author is drawn to a large man's body preserved
   inside a casket--which he revives to the consternation of the yellow
   retinue, and the cheers of the jewel-city's nobles.

   As he has taken the body of a man preserved for over a hundred years
   (whose soul was banished by a sorcerer), the author has to "relearn"
   Laonese, the universal language of the planet; he learns that the
   Jewel-city is known as Phaolon, considered the most splendid city on
   the planet; that its beautiful ruler is princess Niamh the Fair; that
   the yellow-clad man was Akhmim ruler of the rival city of Ardha (also
   known as "yellow city"). He is also "brought up to speed" (the body he
   took was that of a warrior named Chong The Mighty) on swords, bows, and
   other weapons.

   One day, when Chong and Niamh are out on a hunt for celebrating the
   Festival of mating zaiph, they are confronted by a huge (somewhat
   larger than a Bengal tiger) lizard known as ythid; the lizard is killed
   by an arrow from Chong's friend Panthon, but the spilled blood causes
   Niamh and Chong to fall into the web of an elephant-sized spider or
   xoph. As they escape from it, Niamh is drawn to a flower, which turns
   out to be a vampire species--but before it can kill her and Chong, the
   two are rescued by a band of outlaws.

   The outlaw band is led by a female, Siona, who falls in (unrequited, as
   he loves Niamh) love with Chong. Chong makes friends with one of the
   rescuers, Yurgon--but an enemy of another of the band, weasel-faced
   Sligon (who manages to find out about the secret of Niamh and Chong).

   Later, Sligon reveals the secret to Siona (whose father was banished by
   Niamh's) and strikes Chong with a poisoned dagger--only to be
   immediately slain by Siona. Chong aids Niamh in getting to the zaiph
   pens (to escape) prior to succumbing to the wound and poison--at which
   point the narrator (on earth) regains consciousness.

   Under the Green Star was followed a year later by When the Green Star
   Calls.
