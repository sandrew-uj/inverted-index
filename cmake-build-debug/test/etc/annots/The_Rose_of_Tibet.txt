   Charles Houston (a teacher in London) makes a perilous and illegal
   journey from India into the forbidden land of Tibet during the
   unsettled time 1950/51, in the hope of rescuing his vanished brother.
   What he does not know is that his coming was prophesied a century
   earlier, and he is awaited by an impossible love, an enormous treasure,
   and the invading Red Chinese army. Houston travels to the Yamdring
   monastery, finds his way to the abbess and makes a perilous escape with
   her. The story is set at the time of the Chinese invasion in 1950.
