   As with the first novel, the book focuses on the efforts of Mitchell
   Gant to steal the fictional prototype MiG-31 Firefox Soviet aircraft.
   At the climax of Firefox, Gant engaged in combat with a second MiG-31;
   the second novel begins mere moments later, with Gant discovering that
   his aircraft sustained damage in the dogfight and is losing fuel
   rapidly. After a brief engagement with two Soviet MiG-25s, Gant lands
   the Firefox on a frozen Finnish lake, whereupon the weight of the
   aircraft causes it to break through the ice and become submerged.

   Upon fleeing the lake, Gant is captured by the KGB and taken back to
   the Soviet Union. The West must then mount a desperate attempt to
   recover the Firefox from the lake, repair it, and return it to flyable
   condition before Soviet forces can recapture or destroy it. At the same
   time, Gant attempts to escape the Soviet Union. Dmitri Priabin (a KGB
   officer with a minor role in Firefox) has an expanded role in its
   sequel; his lover has been working for the Americans under the codename
   Burgoyne, forcing Priabin to choose between recapturing Gant and saving
   the woman.

   Unlike its predecessor, Firefox Down did not become a feature film. The
   book, however, depicts the MiG-31 from the movie on the cover and the
   text of the novel describes it as black, as it was in the movie, rather
   than the original silver.
