   Students at Bratsky Monastery in Kiev (Kyiv) break for summer
   vacation. The impoverished students must find food and lodging
   along their journey home. They stray from the high road at the sight of
   a farmstead, hoping its cottagers would provide them.

   A group of three, the kleptomaniac theologian Khalyava, the
   merry-making philosopher Khoma Brut, and the younger-aged rhetorician
   Tiberiy Gorobets, attracted by a false target, must walk extra distance
   before finally reaching a farm with two cottages, as night drew near.

   At night, the woman calls on Khoma, and begins grabbing at him. This is
   no amorous embrace; the flashy-eyed woman leaps on his back and rides
   him like a horse. When she broom-whips him, his legs begin to motion
   beyond his control. He sees the black forest part before them, and
   realizes she is a witch (Russian: ved'ma, ved'ma). He is strangely
   envisioning himself galloping over the surface of a glass-mirror like
   sea: he sees his own reflection in it, and the grass grows deep
   underneath; he bears witness to a sensually naked water-nymph
   (rusalka).

   By chanting prayers and exorcisms, he slows himself down, and his
   vision is back to seeing ordinary grass. He now throws off the witch,
   and rides on her back instead. He picks up a piece of log, and
   beats her. The older woman collapses, and transforms into a beautiful
   girl with "long, pointy eyelashes".

   Later, rumour circulates that a Cossack chief (sotnik)'s daughter
   was found crawling home, beaten near death, her last wish being for
   Khoma the seminary student to come pray for her at her deathbed, and
   for three successive nights after she dies.

   Khoma learns of this from the seminary's rector who orders him to go.
   Khoma wants to flee, but the bribed rector is in league with the
   Cossack henchmen, who are already waiting with the kibitka wagon to
   transport him.

   At the Cossack community

   The Cossack chief Yavtukh (nicknamed Kovtun) explains that his daughter
   expired before she finished revealing how she knew Khoma; at any rate
   he swears horrible vengeance upon her killer. Khoma turns sympathetic,
   and swears to discharge his duty (hoping for a handsome reward), but
   the daughter killed turns out to be the witch he had fatally beaten.

   The Cossacks start relating stories about comrades, revealing all sorts
   of terrible exploits by the chief's daughter, whom they know is a
   witch. One comrade was charmed by her, ridden like a horse, and did not
   survive long; another had his infant child's blood sucked out at the
   throat, and his wife killed by the blue necrotic witch who growled like
   a dog. Inexhaustible episodes about the witch-daughter follow.

   The first night, Khoma is escorted to the gloomy church to hold vigil
   alone with the girl's body. Just as he wonders if it may come alive,
   the girl is reanimated and walks towards him. Frightened, Khoma draws a
   magic circle of protection around himself, and she is unable to cross
   the line. She turns cadaverously blue, and reenters her coffin
   making it fly around wildly, but the barrier holds until the rooster
   crows.

   The next night, he draws the magic circle again and recites prayer,
   which render him invisible, and she is seen clawing at empty space. The
   witch summons unseen, winged demons and monsters, that bang and rattle
   and screech at the windows and door from the outside, trying to enter.
   He endures until the rooster's crow. He is brought back, and the people
   notice half his hair had turned gray.

   Khoma'a attempted escape into the brambles fails. The third and most
   terrifying night, the winged "unclean powers" (nechistaya sila
   nechistaya sila) are all audibly darting around him, and the
   witch-corpse calls on these spirits to bring the Viy, the one who can
   see everything. The squat Viy is hairy with an iron face, bespattered
   all over with black earth, its limbs like fibrous roots. The Viy orders
   its long-dangling eyelids reaching the floor to be lifted so it can
   see. Khoma, despite his warning instinct, cannot resist the temptation
   to watch. The Viy is able to see Khoma's whereabouts, the spirits all
   attack, and Khoma falls dead. The cock crows, but this is already its
   second morning call, and the "gnomes" who are unable to flee get
   trapped forever in the church, which eventually becomes overgrown by
   weeds and trees.

   The story ends with Khoma's two friends commenting on his death and how
   it was his lot in life to die in such a way, agreeing that if his
   courage held he would have survived.
