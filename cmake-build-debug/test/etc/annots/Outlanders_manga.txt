   Outlanders begins in modern day Tokyo with the arrival of a Biomech, a
   giant, organic starship that easily destroys several Japanese
   Self-Defense Force (JSDF) helicopters. News photographer Tetsuya
   Wakatsuki comes face-to-face with the craft's occupant Kahm, crown
   princess of the technologically advanced, interstellar Santovasku
   Empire. She charges him, he manages to fend her off, and she retreats
   without her sword. Kahm's father, Emperor Quevas, is informed that the
   Santovaskuan "sacred planet" is infested with humans while the JSDF
   supreme commander Togo prepares for an impending war with the alien
   invaders. Battia Bureitin Rou, a Santovasku fleet commander and Kahm's
   best friend, is sent to retrieve the princess when she returns to the
   city in search of her sword. During a skirmish with the humans,
   Battia's ship takes heavy damage, which triggers the Biomech's
   self-destruct mechanism. Having found her sword and Tetsuya in his
   apartment, Kahm receives a warning from Battia and evacuates with
   Tetsuya as the entire Japanese archipelago is vaporized. Meanwhile,
   Tetsuya's boss, Aki Okazawa, is taken to Siberia by the JSDF. There she
   meets Neo, Togo's superior and the leader of the secret world political
   organization known as the Shadow Cabinet. He exposits that millions of
   years earlier Earth was the seat of the Ra Empire, torn apart in a
   civil war between two belligerants: the Yoma Clan and the progenitors
   of the current Santovasku Empire. Neo, himself a surviving Yoma from
   this conflict, tells Aki that her body houses the spirit of the Yoma
   witch Jilehr Maruda and that he wishes to utilize her immense power to
   exact revenge on the Santovasku. Shortly thereafter, Quevas gives the
   order for all human life to be exterminated, resulting in large
   portions Europe being bombarded by the empire. Neo awakens Jilehr
   within Aki and the assaulting platoon is instantly obliterated by her
   magic.

   Tetsuya hears of Japan's fate and forces Kahm to return him to Earth.
   The two crash land in Germany and meet scavenger Raisa Vogel. They
   evade capture by German troops and Raisa splits off on her own. Kahm
   and Tetsuya discuss marrying to create a diplomatic alliance between
   the humans and Santovasku. The couple rendezvous with Kahm's Nuba Tribe
   servants, use her crashed ship's communicator to call for extraction,
   and set a course for the Santovasku imperial home world. Battia joins
   them. Kahm tells her she is denouncing her father's intention of
   arranging her marriage to produce a royal heir and is strategically
   marrying Tetsuya to stop the war. Once arriving and making their case,
   an unconvinced Quevas has Tetsuya arrested and sentences him to death
   then puts Kahm under house arrest. With the aid of Battia and the Nuba,
   they manage to escape and head for Earth again in hopes of gaining
   support from its military to fight the empire instead. Realizing their
   affection for one another has grown, Kahm and Tetsuya still intend to
   wed. Upon reaching Earth's orbit, Kahm pleads with empire affiliate
   Geobaldi to join their efforts, which he does following a duel with
   Tetsuya. Neo continues to groom Jilehr in exacting vengeance on the
   Santovasku. Togo, now the head of Earth's global armed forces, plots
   against the Yoma so that humanity alone may ultimately triumph so that
   he can achieve his own ambitions of galactic conquest.

   The rebels land on Earth, reunite with Raisa, and have brief diplomatic
   talks with Togo before leaving. Togo then has Neo gunned down and
   initiates Operation Phoenix. This unveils the Earth's moon as an
   enormous weapon called Dola, which was built by the Ra Empire eons ago.
   Raisa and Aki both join the rebels and take part in Kahm and Tetsuya's
   wedding. The festivities are cut short when an imperial army group is
   sent to their location by Quevas to demolish Earth for Kahm's continued
   defiance. A large battle between the Santovasku and rebel squadron
   ensues. Aki becomes Jilehr once more and takes control of the rebel
   vessels while Togo gives the command to have Dola strike the
   battlefield frontlines. A substantial percentage of the Santovasku
   fleet is vanquished, but as Togo's team celebrates they receive a
   taunting call from Jilehr. Realizing the sorceress survived the initial
   blast, Togo desperately demands another to eliminate her. However, the
   humans lose control of the ancient weapon to Jilehr as she sets it on a
   collision course with Earth. After madly proclaiming his aspirations to
   rule the galaxy, the selfish Togo is assassinated by one of his
   officers just as Dola and planet impact, wiping out humanity.

   The protagonists find that they have warped to the outskirts of the
   Santovasku imperial planet. Jilehr shows herself again, this time
   surrounded by the vengeful ghosts of the Yoma Clan. Jilehr causes the
   rebel Biomechs to fire on the planet, prompting Quevas to engage with
   her in a fierce battle of magic. Before the Yoma spirits succumb to the
   emperor's overwhelming abilities, Aki breaks free of Jilehr's hold and
   dies. Quevas subsequently appears aboard Kahm's spacecraft. He reveals
   his initial plan to reclaim Earth was to ensure the Yoma's eradication.
   He then teleports with his daughter to the planet's imperial palace.
   With Jilehr gone, the rebels regain control of their warships and
   breach the planet's defenses to rescue Kahm once more. Battia,
   Geobaldi, and Raisa all sacrifice their lives so that Tetsuya can reach
   the palace. Tetsuya proceeds to the royal throne room and is confronted
   by a hostile Kahm. With no memory of her husband due to the influence
   of her father's mind control, she attacks Tetsuya only to come to her
   senses moments later. A final confrontation between Quevas and Kahm
   ends with the princess fatally wounding the emperor with a sword stab.
   His death brings with it the destruction of the imperial planet and the
   Santovasku Empire. Kahm and Tetsuya manage to depart with the Nuba just
   as the planet explodes. Three years later, they have happily settled on
   the peaceful planet Ekoda. Now with quintuplet daughters and one son,
   Kahm and Tetsuya receive a visit from the souls of their deceased
   friends during an annual festival.
