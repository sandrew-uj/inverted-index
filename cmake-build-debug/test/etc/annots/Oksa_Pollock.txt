   The series follows Oksa Pollock, a young girl that has just moved to
   London with her family. She lives the life of an average
   thirteen-year-old girl, dreaming of being a ninja while hanging out
   with her best friend Gus and complaining about her unpleasant and
   strange maths teacher. Oksa soon discovers that she has supernatural
   powers as well as a strange new mark on her stomach. Her grandmother
   Dragomira reveals that this is because she was previously a resident
   and princess of the land of Edefia and had to flee for her life from
   the dangerous group known as the Felons. Dragomira was the Gracious
   (was to be the next Queen and daughter of the older Gracious Malorone),
   and now Oksa has inherited her powers and is the "Last Hope". As the
   series progresses, Oksa must team together with the "Runaways", a group
   of Edefians fleeing the Felons, in order to fight against their evil
   leader Ocious.^[8]
