   On February 6, 2018, the reincarnated Desilu Studios announced that it
   would be producing a feature film of V. The film would be written and
   directed by Kenneth Johnson, and produced by John Hermansen, Barry
   Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added "We are delighted to team up with
   Desilu to bring the timeless--and timely--story of resistance against
   tyranny into the 21st Century ... V will be the first of a cinematic
   trilogy which will tell the full epic tale in the manner I always
   envisioned." Johnson later updated his site to say that Desilu's
   option has expired, and referred to allegations that the individual
   helming the new Desilu was defrauding investors.
