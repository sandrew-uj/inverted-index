   Ellison showed the first six pages of "I Have No Mouth, and I Must
   Scream" to Frederik Pohl, who paid him in advance to finish it. Ellison
   finished writing the story in a single night in 1966, without making
   any changes from the first draft. Afterwards, Pohl edited said
   draft, tweaking some of Ted and Benny's character. Ellison derived
   the story's title, as well as inspiration for this story, from his
   friend William Rotsler's caption of a cartoon of a rag doll with no
   mouth.
