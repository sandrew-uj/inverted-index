   The novel concerns the relationship between two fictional Victorian
   poets, Randolph Henry Ash (whose life and work are loosely based on
   those of the English poet Robert Browning, or Alfred, Lord Tennyson,
   whose work is more consonant with the themes expressed by Ash, as well
   as Tennyson's having been poet-laureate to Queen Victoria) and
   Christabel LaMotte (based on Christina Rossetti), as uncovered by
   present-day academics Roland Michell and Maud Bailey. Following a trail
   of clues from letters and journals, they collaborate to uncover the
   truth about Ash and LaMotte's relationship, before it is discovered by
   rival colleagues. Byatt provides extensive letters, poetry and diaries
   by major characters in addition to the narrative, including poetry
   attributed to the fictional Ash and LaMotte.

   A. S. Byatt, in part, wrote Possession in response to John Fowles'
   novel The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969). In an essay in Byatt's
   nonfiction book, On Histories and Stories, she wrote:

     Fowles has said that the nineteenth-century narrator was assuming
     the omniscience of a god. I think rather the opposite is the
     case--this kind of fictive narrator can creep closer to the feelings
     and inner life of characters--as well as providing a Greek
     chorus--than any first-person mimicry. In 'Possession' I used this
     kind of narrator deliberately three times in the historical
     narrative--always to tell what the historians and biographers of my
     fiction never discovered, always to heighten the reader's
     imaginative entry into the world of the text.
