   A minor earthquake in Seattle forms the trigger to a magnitude 10.5
   earthquake which destroys San Francisco and then Los Angeles. The
   earthquake creates fault lines in the sea floor, which in turn creates
   a massive tsunami which capsizes a large cruise ship (which heavily
   resembles the Queen Mary 2) and causes massive damage to Honolulu,
   Hawaii. It turns out to be only the first of a series of seismic
   events, including the awakening of an extinct volcano in Sun Valley,
   Idaho and sudden instability of aquifers in Monument Valley.
   Deforestation takes place at Kings Peak, Utah, and Hoover Dam in
   Boulder City, Nevada collapses when Lake Mead starts to heat up and
   expand beyond the spillway's capacity. Las Vegas, Nevada is then
   destroyed when acidic water undermines underground limestone, creating
   a massive sinkhole which causes many buildings to simply sink into the
   sand. The worst of the seismic events is a massive fault which opens up
   under South Dakota, destroying Mount Rushmore in the process, and
   begins to travel southward towards the Gulf of Mexico.

   The geologists at the United States Geological Survey in Colorado do
   not understand why seismic events that are very rare or impossible
   would be happening so rapidly, but Dr. Samantha Hill remembers that her
   father had once theorized that the Earth's tectonic plates would reach
   a point of maximum separation, at which point they would reverse
   direction. The theory also states that related seismic activity would
   be vastly accelerated during the initial period of reversal. However,
   Dr. Earl Hill had been ostracized by the USGS for that theory, and had
   abandoned geology to become a successful professional poker player.
   When Las Vegas sinks into the ground, he is caught in the casino of the
   (fictional) Atlas Hotel. Samantha concludes that the massive faultline
   traveling towards the Gulf of Mexico threatens to re-create the Western
   Interior Seaway when it reaches the ocean.

   The second part of the miniseries begins with Dr. Hill's rescue from
   the ruins of the Atlas Hotel just before it is swallowed up completely.
   At the same time, a massive fault line forms in North Dakota, passing
   through South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma. If it reaches
   Houston, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico, as predicted, the Midwestern
   United States will be covered by a new ocean. A massive evacuation of
   the region is ordered, as an earthquake strikes Sedona, Arizona
   destroying the Chapel of the Holy Cross in the process. However, a
   nuclear plant in fictional Red Plains, Texas, is right in the fault's
   path. If it is destroyed, the entire area and hundreds of miles around
   will be contaminated by nuclear waste.

   Dr. Earl Hill comes up with a desperate plan to divert the fault around
   the nuclear plant by opening up a secondary fault running east, by a
   controlled demolition which explosively ignites the massive natural gas
   reserves in the area. The main fault follows the new path around Red
   Plains, saving the nuclear plant, and comes to a halt. The scientists
   at the USGS cheer, only to find that nothing can stop the fault
   altogether. Once again it turns south, slicing through the middle of
   Houston to reach the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern end of the
   fault reaches Hudson Bay. However, the end result of the fault is
   different from what the USGS had expected: when the waters rush into
   the fault, instead of flooding the entire area, they create a new
   riverlike seaway that splits the United States and Canada in half. The
   President declares that although the country is now divided
   geographically, the American people will not be divided spiritually.
