   Maj Sjoewall, joint author of the series.

   During the 1960s and 1970s Sjoewall and Wahloeoe conceived and wrote a
   series of ten police procedural novels about the exploits of detectives
   from the special homicide commission of the Swedish national police; in
   these the character of Martin Beck was the protagonist. Both
   authors also wrote novels separately. For the Martin Beck series, they
   plotted and researched each book together, and then wrote alternate
   chapters simultaneously. The books cover ten years and are renowned
   for extensive character and setting development throughout the series.
   This is in part due to careful planning by Sjoewall and Wahloeoe.
