   The film was due to be a one-hour adaptation of an Isak Dinesen story
   of the same name, from her collection Winter's Tales (1942). It would
   have starred Oja Kodar as a young French aristocratic widow during the
   1870 Franco-Prussian War. After being arrested by the Prussians in
   Sarre, she would have been allowed to proceed to France, but a Prussian
   officer would have offered a passport to all the French prisoners if
   she would come to collect hers naked.
