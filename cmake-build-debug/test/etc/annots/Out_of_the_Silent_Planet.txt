   While on a walking tour, the philologist Elwin Ransom is drugged and
   taken on board a spacecraft bound for a planet called Malacandra. His
   abductors are Devine, a former college acquaintance, and the scientist
   Weston. Wonder and excitement relieve his anguish at being kidnapped,
   but he is put on his guard when he overhears his captors discussing
   their plans to turn him over to the inhabitants of Malacandra as a
   sacrifice.

   Soon after the three land, Ransom escapes and then runs off in terror
   upon first seeing the vaguely humanoid but alien sorns. In his
   wanderings, he finds that all the lakes, streams, and rivers are warm,
   that gravity is significantly lower than on Earth, and that the plants
   and mountains are all extremely tall and thin. After meeting a hross
   named Hyoi, a civilised native of a different species, Ransom becomes a
   guest for several weeks in Hyoi's village, where he uses his
   philological skills to learn the language. Discovering that gold (known
   as "sun's blood"), is plentiful on Malacandra, he discerns Devine's
   motive for making the voyage.

   While out hunting, Ransom and his hrossa companions are told by an
   eldil, an almost invisible, angelic creature, that Ransom must go to
   meet Oyarsa, who is ruler of the planet, and indeed that he should
   already have done so. Shortly after, Hyoi is shot dead by Devine and
   Weston as they track Ransom and Ransom is directed by the hrossa to
   comply with the eldil's instructions and cross the mountains to the
   cave of a sorn named Augray.

   On the way Ransom discovers that he has almost reached the limit of
   breathable air and has to be revived by Augray with a flask of oxygen.
   The next day, carrying Ransom on his shoulder, Augray takes him across
   the bleak tableland and down into another river valley to Meldilorn,
   the island home of Oyarsa. There Ransom meets another species, a
   pfifltrigg who tells him about the beautiful houses and works of art
   that his people make in their native forests.

   Ransom is led to Oyarsa, who explains that there is an Oyarsa for each
   of the planets in the solar system. However, the Oyarsa of Earth -
   which is known as Thulcandra, "the silent planet" - has become "bent",
   or evil, and has been restricted to Earth after "a great war" on the
   authority of Maleldil, the ruler of the universe. Ransom is ashamed at
   how little he can tell the Oyarsa of Malacandra about Earth, and how
   foolish he and other humans seem to Oyarsa.

   While the two are talking, Devine and Weston are brought in, guarded by
   hrossa, because they have killed three members of that species. Weston
   does not believe that Oyarsa exists and he is incapable of conceiving
   that the Malacandrians are anything but ignorant natives, exploitable
   and expendable. This emerges in the course of a long speech in which
   Weston justifies his proposed invasion of Malacandra on "progressive"
   and evolutionary grounds. Weston's motives are shown to be more complex
   than profit: he is bent on expanding humanity through the universe,
   abandoning each planet and star system as its resources are exhausted
   and it becomes uninhabitable. In Ransom's attempts at translation, the
   brutality and crudity of Weston's ambitions are laid bare.

   While acknowledging that Weston is acting out of a sense of duty to his
   species - and does not share Devine's greed for gold - Oyarsa tells
   Weston and Devine that he cannot tolerate their disruptive presence on
   Malacandra; they must leave the planet immediately, even though under
   very unfavourable orbital conditions. Oyarsa offers Ransom the option
   of staying, but Ransom decides he does not belong there either. The
   voyage back is barely made with just ninety days' worth of air and
   other supplies and the spaceship is "unbodied" soon after landing.

   In the final chapter, Lewis introduces himself as a character into his
   own novel. He had written to Ransom enquiring whether he had come
   across the Latin word Oyarses, discovered in a mediaeval Neoplatonist
   work. This prompts Ransom to share his secret and the two resolve to
   hinder Weston from doing further evil in view of "the rapid march of
   [contemporary] events".

   A Postscript quotes one of Ransom's letters to the author expressing
   frustration at how condensation of his adventures obliterates the rich
   detail of what he has learned and witnessed.
