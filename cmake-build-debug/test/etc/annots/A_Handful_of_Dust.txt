   Tony Last is a country gentleman, living with his wife Brenda and his
   eight-year-old son John Andrew in his ancestral home, Hetton Abbey. The
   house is a Victorian pseudo-Gothic pastiche described as
   architecturally "devoid of interest" by a local guide book and "ugly"
   by his wife, but is Tony's pride and joy. Entirely content with country
   life, he is seemingly unaware of Brenda's increasing boredom and
   dissatisfaction, and of his son's developing waywardness. Brenda meets
   John Beaver and, despite acknowledging his dullness and insignificance,
   she begins an affair with him. Brenda starts spending her weeks in
   London, and persuades Tony to finance a small flat, which she rents
   from John's mother, Mrs Beaver, an unscrupulous property developer.
   Although the Brenda-Beaver liaison is well known to their London
   friends, Tony remains uxorious and oblivious; attempts by Brenda and
   her friends to set him up with a mistress are absurdly unsuccessful.

   Brenda is in London when John Andrew is killed in a riding accident. On
   being told that "John is dead", Brenda at first thinks that Beaver has
   died; on learning that it is her son John, she betrays her true
   feelings by uttering an involuntary "Thank God!". After the funeral,
   she tells Tony that she wants a divorce so that she can marry Beaver.
   On learning the extent of her deception Tony is shattered, but agrees
   to protect Brenda's social reputation by allowing her to divorce him,
   and to provide her with -L-500 a year. After spending an awkward but
   chaste weekend in Brighton with a prostitute contriving divorce
   evidence, Tony learns from Brenda's brother that, encouraged by Beaver,
   Brenda is now demanding -L-2,000 a year--a sum that would require Tony
   to sell Hetton. Tony's illusions are shattered. However, the prostitute
   brought her child with her who can establish that Tony did not commit
   adultery and the blackmail fails. Tony withdraws from the divorce
   negotiations, and announces that he intends to travel for six months.
   On his return, he says, Brenda may have her divorce, but without any
   financial settlement.

   With no prospect of Tony's money, Beaver loses interest in Brenda, who
   is left adrift and in poverty. Meanwhile, Tony has met an explorer, Dr
   Messinger, and joins him on an expedition in search of a supposed lost
   city in the Amazon rainforest. On the outward journey, Tony engages in
   a shipboard romance with Therese de Vitre, a young girl whose Roman
   Catholicism causes her to shun him when he tells her he has a wife. In
   Brazil, Messinger proves an incompetent organiser; he cannot control
   the native guides, who abandon him and Tony in the depths of the
   jungle. Tony falls ill, and Messinger leaves in their only canoe to
   find help, but is swept over a waterfall and killed.

   Tony wanders in delirium until he is rescued by Mr Todd, a British
   Guianan who rules over a small extended family in a remote clearing in
   the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd
   owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to
   read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks to be
   helped on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings
   continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony
   realises he is being held against his will. When a search party finally
   reaches the settlement, Todd arranges that Tony be drugged and kept
   hidden; he leads the party to believe that Tony has died, and gives
   them his watch to take home as evidence. When Tony awakes he learns
   that his hopes of rescue are gone, and that he is condemned to read
   Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is
   accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his
   memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.
