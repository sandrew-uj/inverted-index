   The Scarlet Fig: or, Slowly through a Land of Stone, is a fantasy novel
   written by American writer Avram Davidson, edited by Grania Davis and
   Henry Wessells, published in hardcover by Rose Press in 2005. An ebook
   edition was published by Prologue Press in August 2012.^[1]

   It is the third and final novel of the author's Vergil Magus sequence,
   following The Phoenix and the Mirror (1969) and Vergil in Averno
   (1987). It follows Vergil's adventures in an alternate ancient
   Mediterranean world where harpies, basilisks, and satyrs co-exist with
   Rome, Carthage, and the Punic Wars. The books are not written in
   chronological order, and in fact the second and third are prequels to
   the first.
