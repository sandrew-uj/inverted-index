   Two men on a two-week fishing vacation in remote western Ireland are
   surprised to discover a strange abyss. On a rock spur above this pit
   they find ruins and buried in them a journal, which they read.

   The author of the journal introduces himself as an old man who has
   lived for years in an ancient house accompanied only by his sister, who
   serves as housekeeper, and his dog, Pepper. He has no contact with the
   local inhabitants, who say he is mad. The house is circular in form and
   its weird appearance includes peculiar decorations that suggest leaping
   flames. It has had an evil reputation for centuries and had been empty
   for many years when he purchased it. The diary will record his strange
   experiences and thoughts.

   Late one night, as he was reading in his study, the light suddenly
   turned green and then red. Pepper hid under his chair and he sat still,
   frightened. The red light went low, and he was no longer afraid. The
   far side of the room became a vision of a vast empty plain. He floated
   like a bubble into space, leaving the earth and sun behind as he
   traveled into utter darkness and despair. He reached the world of the
   vast plain, whose sun is a wreath of red flame. He was brought to an
   arena: an immense green jade copy of his own house, at the center of a
   circle miles across, circled by mountains containing hundreds of huge
   idols of Beast-gods and Horrors. As he nears the huge building, a
   humanoid creature with the repellent head and face of a huge swine is
   trying to get into the House. The Swine-creature suddenly and horribly
   moves toward him, but he is borne upward, then reverses his travel
   through space to return to his study.

   Several months later, horrible man-sized creatures with dead-white skin
   emerge from a nearby Pit and assault the House. The Swine-Things are
   strong and intelligent but are unable to break in; after a night and
   day in which the Recluse kills some of them they disappear. He is
   terrified by the violent creatures and he waits several days before
   leaving the House with Pepper to search the former gardens outside.

   A week later, he and Pepper explore the Pit that appears to be the
   source of the Swine-Things. A tunnel leads to an immensely deep abyss.
   Water flows down the tunnel and the struggle of wading against it to
   get back out is exhausting. Two weeks afterwards the Pit has become a
   lake. He revisits a trap door in the Cellar, realizing that it opens to
   the bottomless abyss.

   Asleep in his study, the Recluse awakens into a place like a mist of
   light and meets his lost love. She calls the place the Sea of Sleep,
   and implores him to leave the evil House, but admits that they would
   never have met again had he been anywhere else.

   The journal starts again, with the passage of time increasing in speed.
   Days and nights pass more and more quickly, the sun and moon become
   flickers and years blur. Pepper's body, then his own, crumble into
   dust. The House falls, the world fades, time slowly grinds to a halt
   and the solar system ends with his perception of an immense green star,
   celestial globes, and another timeless meeting in the Sea of Sleep with
   the lost love. He is brought again to the Arena and into the great
   House. He is again in his own study, with time running normally.

   The malicious Swine-creature from the Arena inflicts a luminous fungal
   growth on a dog and the Recluse is barely able to stop himself from
   letting it into the House. He has also contracted the disease, and the
   manuscript ends with the man in his study as the creature comes through
   the trap door in the Cellar.

   The two men recover from reading the journal and return to fishing,
   making no attempt to revisit the horrible pit. Their driver interviews
   an old man in the local village who remembers the evil house that
   everyone avoided had once been occupied by an unsociable old man and
   his elderly sister. Once a month, a man who told the villagers nothing
   took supplies to the house; years went by until suddenly that man
   excitedly reported that the house had disappeared and there was now a
   chasm where it had been.
