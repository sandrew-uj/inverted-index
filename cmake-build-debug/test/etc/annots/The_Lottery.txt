   Details of contemporary small-town American life are embroidered upon a
   description of an annual rite known as "the lottery". In a small
   village of about 300 residents, the locals are in an excited yet
   nervous mood on June 27. Children gather stones, as the adult townsfolk
   assemble for their annual event, which in the local tradition is
   apparently practiced to ensure a good harvest (Old Man Warner quotes an
   old proverb: "Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon"). However, some
   other villages have already discontinued the lottery, and rumours are
   spreading that a village farther north is considering doing likewise.

   The lottery preparations start the night before, with coal merchant Mr.
   Summers and postmaster Mr. Graves drawing up a list of all the extended
   families in town and preparing a set of paper slips, one per family,
   All are blank except one, later revealed to be marked with a black dot.
   The slips are folded and placed in a black wooden box, which in turn is
   stored in a safe at Mr. Summers' office until the lottery is scheduled
   to begin.

   In the morning of the lottery, the townspeople gather shortly before 10
   a.m. in order to have everything done in time for lunch. First, the
   heads of the extended families each draw one slip from the box, but
   wait to unfold them until all the slips have been drawn. Bill
   Hutchinson gets the marked slip, meaning that his family has been
   chosen. His wife Tessie protests that Mr. Summers rushed him through
   the drawing, but the other townspeople dismiss her complaint. Since the
   Hutchinson family consists of only one household, a second drawing to
   choose one household within the family is skipped.

   For the final drawing, one slip is placed in the box for each member of
   the household: Bill, Tessie, and their three children. Each of the five
   draws a slip, and Tessie gets the marked one. The townspeople pick up
   the gathered stones and begin throwing them at her as she screams about
   the injustice of the lottery.
