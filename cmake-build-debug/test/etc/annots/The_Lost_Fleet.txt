   The Lost Fleet is a military science fiction series written by John G.
   Hemry under the pen name Jack Campbell. The series is set
   one-hundred-plus years into an interstellar war between two different
   human cultures, the Alliance and the Syndics. The protagonist of the
   story is discovered floating in a suspended animation escape pod one
   hundred years after he made a "heroic last stand" against an enemy
   fleet. In his absence, he has been made into a renowned hero in the
   Alliance, but his legend and actions are used to justify poor tactics
   and decisions. Awakened after being discovered during a secret mission
   that turns out to be an enemy trap, he is suddenly dropped into the
   role of fleet commander and expected to live up to the legend that has
   grown around him.

   The series ended with Victorious (2010). The author, however, has
   continued the Lost Fleet series with three spin-offs: Beyond the
   Frontier, focusing on the main characters from the Lost Fleet; The Lost
   Stars, focusing on the Syndicate Worlds; Outlands, picking up where
   Leviathan leaves off; as well as a prequel series, The Genesis
   Fleet.
