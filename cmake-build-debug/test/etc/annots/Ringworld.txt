   On planet Earth in 2850 AD, Louis Gridley Wu is celebrating his 200th
   birthday. Despite his age, Louis is in perfect physical condition due
   to the longevity drug boosterspice. He meets Nessus, a Pierson's
   puppeteer, who offers him a mysterious job. Intrigued, Louis eventually
   accepts. Speaker-to-Animals (Speaker), who is a Kzin, and Teela Brown,
   a young human woman who becomes Louis's lover, also join the crew.

   On the puppeteer home world, they are told that the expedition's goal
   is to investigate the Ringworld,^[3] a gigantic artificial ring, to see
   if it poses any threat. The Ringworld is about one million miles (1.6
   million km) wide and approximately the diameter of Earth's orbit (which
   makes it about 584.3 million miles or 940.4 million km in
   circumference), encircling a sunlike star. It rotates to provide
   artificial gravity 99.2% as strong as Earth's from centrifugal force.
   The Ringworld has a habitable, flat inner surface (equivalent in area
   to approximately three million Earths), a breathable atmosphere and a
   temperature optimal for humans. Night is provided by an inner ring of
   shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin, ultra-strong
   wire. When the crew completes their mission, they will be given the
   starship in which they travelled to the puppeteer home world; it is
   orders of magnitude faster than any possessed by humans or Kzinti.

   When they reach the vicinity of the Ringworld, they are unable to
   contact anyone, and their ship, the Lying Bastard, is disabled by the
   Ringworld's automated meteoroid-defense system. The severely damaged
   vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands
   near a huge mountain, "Fist-of-God". As the fusion drive is destroyed,
   they are unable to launch back into space where they could use the
   undamaged faster-than-light hyperdrive to return home. They set out to
   find a way to get the Lying Bastard off the Ringworld.

   Using their flycycles (similar to antigravity motorcycles), they try to
   reach the rim of the ring, where they hope to find some technology that
   will help them. It will take them months to cross the vast distance.
   When Teela develops "Plateau trance" (a kind of highway hypnosis), they
   are forced to land. On the ground, they encounter apparently primitive
   human natives who live in the crumbling ruins of a once-advanced city
   and think that the crew are the engineers who created the ring, and
   whom they revere as gods. The crew is attacked when they commit what
   the natives consider blasphemy (the misuse of certain technologies).

   They continue their journey, during which Nessus reveals some Puppeteer
   secrets: they have conducted experiments on both humans (breeding for
   luck via Birthright Lotteries: all of Teela's ancestors for six
   generations were born from winning the lottery) and Kzinti (breeding
   for reduced aggression via the Man-Kzin wars, which the Kzinti always
   lost). Speaker's outrage forces Nessus to flee and follow them from a
   safe distance.

   In a floating building over the ruins of a city, they find a map of the
   Ringworld and videos of its past civilization.

   While flying through a giant storm caused by air escaping through a
   hole in the Ring floor due to a meteoroid impact, Teela becomes
   separated from the others. While Louis and Speaker search for her,
   their flycycles are caught by an automated police trap designed to
   catch traffic offenders. They are trapped in the basement of a floating
   police station. Nessus enters the station to try to help them.

   In the station, they meet Halrloprillalar Hotrufan ("Prill"), a former
   crew member of a spaceship used for trade between the Ringworld and
   other inhabited worlds. When her ship returned to the Ringworld the
   last time, they found that civilization had collapsed. The crew managed
   to enter the Ringworld, but some of them were killed and others
   suffered brain damage when the device that let them pass through the
   Ringworld floor failed. From her account, Louis surmises that a mold
   was brought back from one of the other planets by a spaceship like
   Prill's; it broke down the superconductors vital to the Ringworld
   civilization, dooming it.

   Teela reaches the police station, accompanied by her new lover, a
   native "hero" called Seeker who helped her survive. Based on an insight
   gained from studying an ancient Ringworld map, Louis comes up with a
   plan to get home. Teela chooses to remain on the Ringworld with Seeker.
   Louis, formerly skeptical about breeding for luck, now wonders if the
   entire mission was caused by Teela's luck, to unite her with her true
   love and help her mature.

   The party collects one end of the shadow-square wire that was snapped
   when the ship crashed. They travel back to their crashed ship in the
   floating police station, dragging the wire behind them. Louis threads
   it through the ship to tether it to the police station. He then takes
   the police station up to the summit of "Fist-of-God", the enormous
   mountain near their crash site. The mountain had not appeared on the
   Ringworld map, leading Louis to conclude that it is in fact the result
   of a meteoroid impact with the underside of the ring, which pushed the
   "mountain" up from the ring's floor and broke through. The top of the
   mountain, above the atmosphere, is therefore just a hole in the
   Ringworld floor. Louis drives the police station over the edge,
   dragging the Lying Bastard along with it. The Ringworld spins very
   quickly, so once the ship drops through the hole and clears the ring,
   they can use the ship's hyperdrive to get home. The book concludes with
   Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.
