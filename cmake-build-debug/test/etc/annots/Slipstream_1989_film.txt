   A voiceover sets the scene: the time is after the Harmonic Convergence,
   when drastic climate change has swept away civilization as we know it.
   A vast wind current, the Slipstream, encircles the globe, and a few
   scattered settlements of survivors attempt to keep human life going.

   An aeroplane pursues a man running down a canyon, cornering him at a
   precipice. The plane lands, and its occupants, bounty hunters Will
   Tasker and Belitski, chase the man and shoot him with a grappling hook.
   The fugitive looks at his arm, but seems intrigued rather than
   distressed. Tasker pulls on the rope and the man tumbles down the side
   of the canyon, but he is not harmed. Immediately after his fall, the
   fugitive quotes from the aviator and poet John Gillespie Magee, Jr.: "I
   have slipped the surly bonds of Earth, put out my hand and touched the
   Face of God."

   The bounty hunters take their prisoner to a busy airstrip, where he
   stands beside them, handcuffed, as they eat in the diner. Matt Owens, a
   smalltime arms dealer, nearly gets his arm broken when he makes a pass
   at Belitski, then tries to sell contraband to Tasker. It is then
   revealed that Tasker and Belitski are part of the remnants of a law
   enforcement agency, trying to keep the peace in a post-apocalyptic
   society. Tasker seizes some of Owens' goods. However, as the pair are
   leaving, Owens abducts their prisoner so that he can claim the large
   reward. Tasker shoots Owens with a dart, telling him that it is
   poisoned; but it also implants a tracking device in Owens' body,
   enabling Belitski and Tasker to follow them.

   Owens first flies to his home, Hell's Kitchen. On the way, the prisoner
   quotes from the poetry of Byron, and misunderstanding, Owens begins to
   call him Byron. After their arrival at Hell's Kitchen, Byron heals a
   boy blinded by cataracts, and Owens begins to wonder if Byron is more
   than he appears. After getting lost, they land at the home of a cult of
   cave-dwellers who worship the Slipstream and who have recently been
   under attack by bandits. Byron attempts to help, lifting a heavy
   milling stone off Avatar, the cult's leader. Avatar, in his dying
   words, curses Byron as being part of the out-of-control technological
   advancements that led to the apocalyptic Convergence. The cultists
   decide to let the wind decide what to do with Byron, and tie him to a
   massive kite in the wind.

   The bounty hunters arrive in the middle of a windstorm, and Owens
   bargains with them to work together to get Byron down. Tasker reveals
   to Owens that Byron is an android. After a rough landing from the
   destroyed kite, Belitski allows Byron and Owens to get away. Another
   visitor to the valley, Ariel, helps them escape and convinces them to
   take her to her former home. Ariel introduces them to her people, who
   inhabit a fortified underground museum. Byron's knowledge and
   appreciation of the museum's ancient contents lead Ariel to become
   emotionally attached to him. Byron and Ariel spend the night together,
   while Owens gets drunk and hooks up with a girl in the community. The
   girl helps Owens decide to free Byron, who has become his friend.
   Later, Byron reveals that the man he killed was his master; he himself
   was designed as the man's companion, and when the man asked him to end
   his life, he obeyed, even though he was programmed to do no harm. Byron
   also excitedly tells Matt that he has slept for the first time, and
   that he dreamed of a land at the end of the Slipstream, inhabited by
   other androids.

   Having tracked the trio to the museum, Tasker and Belitski force entry,
   killing guards and some inhabitants. After beating the Curator, Tasker
   forces the rest to find the fugitives. Byron is captured while Belitski
   shoots Owens in the chest with a dart; Owens retaliates by knocking her
   out and handcuffing her to a bed. She wakes and explains that the dart
   is the antidote to the poison. Owens engages in a shootout with Tasker
   in which Ariel is killed. Enraged at her death, Byron pursues Tasker to
   his plane. Tasker shoots Byron to no effect, then tries to run him down
   with the plane as he takes off. However, Byron manages to climb on and
   smash his way into the cockpit. As Byron is on the verge of killing
   him, Tasker quotes the Magee poem, and he relents. He then attempts to
   regain control of the damaged aircraft by using the control wires, but
   it crashes. Tasker is killed, but Byron survives; he is apparently
   indestructible. He returns to the museum to find that Belitski has
   consented to become Owens' partner; they fly off together. Byron leaves
   to seek his promised land.
