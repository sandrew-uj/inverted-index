   Wheelchair-using Sir Hugo Coal narrates this tale of vice and murder at
   stately Crook Manor. Unable to communicate with those around him, the
   quirky Sir Hugo watches and listens, recounting recent events that
   began with his daughter's engagement, followed by the disappearance of
   her fiance and the subsequent investigation. Of particular note is new
   butler Fledge, whom Sir Hugo believes is not only the cause of the
   troubles at the estate, but seeking to replace him as lord of the manor
   and in Lady Harriet's bed.
