   In the near future a mysterious plague kills almost every adult and
   leaves behind "a world of orphans". Some fortunate few are raised by
   the surviving adults, including Lee (John Stockwell), who is taken in
   and raised by Albert (James Earl Jones) on his remote farm. Fifteen
   years later, Lee sets out for the nearby ruins of Los Angeles in the
   hopes of joining the Clippers, a famous motorcycle gang. Lee follows a
   convoy of trucks into a fenced off building, where he is noticed by
   Bolo (Norbert Weisser), who is overseeing operations. When workers
   begin to converge on Lee he flees on his motorcycle.

   After defending himself against and fleeing from a hostile group of
   bikers known as the DAs, Lee makes his way into Clippers territory and
   meets their leader Mick (Darrell Larson) and his second in command
   Whitey (John Diehl). When Lee asks to join the gang he is rebuffed.
   Mick sends Yogi (Rae Dawn Chong) along to escort Lee safely to the city
   limits. The two are chased by the DAs when they discover one of the
   bikers who attacked Lee earlier has died from his injuries. Lee and
   Yogi manage to evade the DAs and head back to Clippers territory.
   Whitey and Mick debate turning him over to Ray (Danny De La Paz), the
   leader of the DAs, to preserve the "no guns, no killing" truce that
   exists between the two gangs, but Sammy (Don Keith Opper) offers a
   suggestion. When Ray arrives, Whitey proposes a test of combat between
   Lee and the DAs' best combatant to decide if he lives; Ray agrees.
   After he leaves Ray heads to the factory where he reports to Bolo, who
   tells him he will be sending one of his employees with him to the
   competition.

   The next day the two gangs arrive for the competition. Before the fight
   begins Ray presents Wickings (Kim Cattrall), who introduces herself and
   Bolo as representatives of the Sunya Corporation, brought to L.A. at
   the behest of the Federal government. Wickings attempts to convince
   Mick to have the Clippers help with Sunya's efforts to restore the
   city, but Mick turns her down. The gangs proceed with the competition,
   pitting Lee against a female DA. Though initially surprised by the
   woman's fierceness, Lee ultimately defeats her without killing her as
   the Clippers leave victorious, Lee now officially a member of the gang.

   Back at the Sunya factory Wickings unsuccessfully tries to convince
   Bolo and his boss Carver (Robby Benson) that the Clippers can be
   brought around. Bolo leaves the office to meet Ray, where he scolds the
   gang leader for failing to bring the Clippers on board, then gives him
   a gun. This is observed from the rafters by Whitey, but as he attempts
   to leave he nearly falls and is noticed. Bolo's men give chase and
   ultimately capture him, and Bolo executes him in front of Ray. Wickings
   leaves the office in time to see Bolo standing over Whitey's body. The
   next day she files an electronic report with the government accusing
   Bolo and Carver of violating company directives, specifically in using
   armed force to recruit workers, but receives a reply that the two have
   been authorized to use any and all measures they deem necessary. After
   being confronted by Bolo, Wickings returns to her quarters where she
   obtains a schematic of the facility's sewer system and uses it to
   escape.

   As the Clippers prepare to have a funeral for Whitey, Bolo makes plans
   to ambush the group during the ceremony. Ray begs Bolo for one last
   chance to convince Mick; Bolo agrees, but readies his men anyway. At
   the funeral Ray attempts to reason with Mick, but instead starts a
   brawl between the DAs and Clippers. The brawl is cut short when Bolo
   and his men open fire on the Clippers, killing many and rounding up
   others to be used as slave labor. Mick is wounded, but he, Lee, Yogi,
   Frankie (Pamela Ludwig), Sammie, Ramos (Tony Plana) and a few others
   escape. Mick leaves for one last meeting with Ray, who tries to
   convince Mick to leave town as soon as he can. Bolo and a group of men
   arrive at the meeting and take custody of Mick, tipped off to its
   location by Ernie. Bolo tasks Ray with bringing Ernie back to the Sunya
   factory; Ray gives him a ride, but kills him along the way for his
   betrayal of his former friend. Bolo tortures Mick to reveal the
   location of the remaining Clippers, but before he can get the
   information the group arrives, rescues Mick and flees the city for
   Albert's farm.

   The group spends time at Albert's farm recuperating, during which time
   Lee and Wickings become romantically involved. Lee and Mick form a plan
   to retake the city from Sunya. The group fix up their bikes, and head
   to the city, accompanied by Albert in his restored 1950s Cadillac.
   Wickings and Lee infiltrate the Sunya factory using the sewers,
   overpower the guard overseeing the captured Clippers' training, and
   frees the group, leading them back to their impounded motorcycles. The
   reformed Clippers head back for Sunya to finish the job, only to be
   stopped by the DAs. Rather than fighting them though, Ray allows them
   to proceed, and he and the rest of the DAs join the Clippers in their
   assault on the Sunya factory.

   At Sunya, Wickings and Sammy disable the power, allowing the unified
   gang to attack in the confusion. Bolo arrives soon after, holding the
   two at gunpoint and turning the power back on. This allows a Sunya
   vehicle with a mounted machine gun to open fire on the gangs. The
   advantage is short-lived: assisted by Frankie, Albert takes out the
   vehicle using an explosive-laden remote controlled model plane. Sammy
   and Wickings make their escape while Bolo is stunned by the explosion,
   and Albert crashes a second explosive plane into Bolo, killing him.
   With most of Sunya's personnel fleeing or dead, Lee, Wickings, Mick and
   Yogi head for the main building to confront Carver. They find him, but
   Carver is unimpressed, calmly stating that even if he is killed,
   someone just like him or worse will be sent in his place. Before anyone
   else can act Ray drives into the office on his motorcycle, simply
   responding with, "no", before he crushes Carver between his desk and
   the wall, killing him.

   In the aftermath, the Clippers and DAs unite, becoming the Clippers
   Corporation. Wickings assists in helping them petition the Federal
   government to grant them official control of the city, which the
   government accepts. Lee stays with the Clippers, while Albert returns
   to his farm.
