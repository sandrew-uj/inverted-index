   Author Iain M. Banks

   The Culture series is a science fiction series written by Scottish
   author Iain M. Banks and released from 1987 through to 2012. The
   stories centre on The Culture, a utopian, post-scarcity space society
   of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial
   intelligences living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way
   galaxy. The main theme of the series is the dilemmas that an
   idealistic, more-advanced civilization faces in dealing with smaller,
   less-advanced civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose
   behaviour it sometimes finds barbaric. In some of the stories action
   takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading
   characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture,
   sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its
   plans to civilize the galaxy. Each novel is a self-contained story with
   new characters, although reference is occasionally made to the events
   of previous novels.
