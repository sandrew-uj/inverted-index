   Set in the future, the plot follows Zoichi Kanoe and his AI companion
   Fuyu Kanoe, whose luminous form is integrated into the system of his
   motorcycle. They are agents sent by TOA Heavy Industries to retrieve
   humans with the ability to resist and transmute the N5S infection
   originating from Mars, which is spreading across the world fast,
   turning humans into "Drones"; disfigured, zombie-like beings.

   The art in Biomega is similar to that of Blame!, with its complicated
   concrete sprawl and extremely vast, empty spaces. In this manga, there
   is emphasis on the swiftness of the attacks made by Zoichi, such as the
   gun being holstered just before the enemies fall to the ground. Speed
   is crucial in this manga, unlike in Blame!, and the plot develops
   quickly.
