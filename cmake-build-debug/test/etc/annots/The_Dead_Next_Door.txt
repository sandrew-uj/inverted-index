   In the near future, the world falls victim to a plague of violent
   carnivorous undead humans, and a black-ops elite team of soldiers,
   nicknamed the "Zombie Squad", has been enlisted by the government as
   exterminators to control the growing epidemic. While on a series of
   routine containment missions, the soldiers stumble upon a mysterious
   religious cult which wishes to protect and enable the zombies,
   believing them to be a punishment ordained by God. Within their
   compound may be a cure to the virus causing the plague.
