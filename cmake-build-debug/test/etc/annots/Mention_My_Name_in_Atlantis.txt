   The story is told by the unreliable narrator Hoptor the Vintner, a
   fast-talking operator with all the right contacts who is convinced in
   the face of mounting evidence to the contrary that he can smooth over
   anything. "Mention my name" is his tagline, meant to assure his
   auditors that dropping it in various quarters is their ticket to
   getting whatever they want. The book combines a number of cliches of
   the literature and pseudoscience regarding Atlantis, such as
   extraterrestrial visitors, as well as of the fantasy genre in general,
   most notably the ambitious barbarian brute, Conax of Chimeria, a satire
   on Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan of Cimmeria.
