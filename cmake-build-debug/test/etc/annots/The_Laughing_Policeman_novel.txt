   The crime scene: a Leyland Atlantean bus.

   A gunman shoots the passengers of a bus with a sub-machine gun, killing
   eight people, including Detective AAke Stenstroem, and wounding one.
   After a painstaking investigation, Detective Beck and his team come to
   suspect that the mass killing is designed to hide the true target,
   Stenstroem himself, who was spending his free time unofficially
   investigating the murder of a Portuguese prostitute sixteen years
   earlier in an attempt to solve the case and demonstrate his skills to
   his older police comrades. Beck must now complete Stenstrom's work by
   solving the earlier murder in order to identify Stenstrom's killer.
