   The story is set on Werel, the third planet of the Gamma Draconis
   system. The planet has an orbital period of 60 Earth years, and is
   approaching its correspondingly long winter. The main characters belong
   to one of two major groups: Wold and his daughter Rolery are members of
   the Tevarans, a tribe of humanoid extraterrestrial indigenous to the
   planet. Jakob Agat is a young man from a dwindling colony of Earth
   humans that have been effectively marooned on the planet. Although both
   populations share a common genetic heritage in the Hainish people, the
   difference is significant enough to prevent interbreeding.

   The relationship between the two groups has long been tense and
   characterized by limited interaction. However, with the approaching
   dangers of winter and marauders, the visit of curious young Rolery to
   the colony becomes a sign of coming changes.
