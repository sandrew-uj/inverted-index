   Steel Beach takes place in Varley's "Eight Worlds" universe. The Solar
   System has been colonized by human refugees fleeing aliens (known as
   "the Invaders"). Earth and Jupiter are off-limits to humanity, but
   Earth's Moon and the other planets and moons of the Solar System have
   all become populated. There are also minor colonies set in the Oort
   cloud beyond the Solar System itself.

   The "steel beach" of the title is Earth's Moon, the most heavily
   inhabited world in the Solar System since the Invaders obliterated
   human civilization on Earth The title alludes to humans being
   figuratively thrown onto the inhospitable Moon, a parallel to fish
   making their way onto land in the evolution of amphibians.^[citation

   The book's protagonist, Hildy Johnson, is a newspaper reporter, named
   after the male protagonist of the 1928 play and 1931 film The Front
   Page and the female protagonist of the 1940 film His Girl Friday (Hildy
   changes gender halfway through the book), who finds trouble beneath the
   surface of the near-utopian society run by the Central Computer. The
   Central Computer runs every aspect of every person's life: it is the
   government, court, information source, and friend to every citizen.

   In the beginning of the novel, Hildy has become dissatisfied with life,
   much like many others on the moon who take part, for example, in
   destructive activities such as "slash boxing"--a blend of knife
   fighting and boxing, on which Hildy reports. It is revealed that Hildy
   has made multiple suicide attempts. Scenes such as a discussion of
   suicide with a slain slash boxer suggest that Hildy is an unreliable
   narrator.

   The first half of the story deals with behaviors in the future society
   such as indoctrinations of celebrity heads-in-jars, negotiating with
   brontosaurus herds to figure out whom they will sacrifice to make
   burger patties, and Earth-themed "Disneylands" which come complete with
   snakes, sand and sunburns. The protagonist grew up on a brontosaur
   ranch run by a no-nonsense rancher with little time for philosophical
   speculation, and finds solace in the quasi-dedication of the Texas
   Disneyland's inhabitant towards authenticity.

   In the second half, Hildy makes contact with a group of people who have
   figured out how to exist on the surface without spacesuits. These
   people reveal that they are hiding from the Central Computer, both to
   keep their technology secret, and to stay free of secret experiments
   the Central Computer has been performing on people.

   Hildy then learns that the Central Computer has been attempting to
   clone the deceased and that this would solve Hildy's suicide problem.
   The Central Computer decides to launch a military raid to eliminate the
   people causing its own malfunctions. This raid, and the idea of using
   brute force to solve the problem, is unsuccessful.
