   Warriors is a series of novels based on the adventures and drama of
   multiple clans of feral cats. The series is primarily set in the
   fictional location of White Hart Woods, and later, Sanctuary Lake.
   Published by HarperCollins, the series is written by authors Kate Cary,
   Cherith Baldry, and Tui T. Sutherland under the collective pseudonym
   Erin Hunter. The concept and plot of the pilot series (The Prophecies
   Begin) was developed by now-series editor Victoria Holmes.

   There are currently seven sub-series, each containing six books except
   for the seventh sub-series, which is currently in progress. The first,
   Warriors (later re-titled Warriors: The Prophecies Begin), was
   published from 2003 to 2004, and details the adventures of a "kittypet"
   (housecat) named Rusty who joins ThunderClan, one of the warrior cat
   clans who live in the forest, and must leave his kittypet life behind
   to learn "the warrior code" and how to be a good leader who can save
   the clans from destroying themselves. Warriors: The New Prophecy
   (2005-2006) continues with a focus on the next generation of young
   cats, and chronicles the four Clans' journey to a new home.

   The third sub-series, Power of Three (2007-2009), centers around three
   prophesied cats with extraordinary powers, and the fourth sub-series,
   Omen of the Stars (2009-2012) details said cats using their powers to
   defeat spirit cats. The fifth sub-series, Dawn of the Clans, was
   published from 2013 to 2015. This prequel series arc details the
   formation of the Clans. The sixth sub-series, A Vision of Shadows, was
   published from 2016 to 2018 and chronologically continues where Omen of
   the Stars left off. It details the return of a lost Clan, as well as a
   troublesome group of outsiders.

   The seventh sub-series is entitled The Broken Code and began with Lost
   Stars, which was released on 9 April 2019. The sub-series focuses on
   the cat's connection to their religion, and what happens when they are
   cut off from it. It also details the possession of a Clan leader by a
   vengeful spirit.

   The eighth sub-series is titled A Starless Clan, and it is scheduled to
   release its first book, River, in April 2022. It centers around the
   Clans rewriting the rules they live by.

   Other books have been released in addition to the main series,
   including 13 lengthier stand-alone "Super Edition" novels, several
   e-book novellas later published in seven print compilations, seven
   guide books, and several volumes of original English-language manga,
   initially produced as a collaboration between HarperCollins and
   Tokyopop before the latter's closure. The series has also been
   translated into several languages.

   Alibaba Pictures acquired the film rights to the series in 2016, though
   no news about it has been released since.

   Major themes in the series include adventure, forbidden love, the
   concept of nature vs. nurture, acceptance, the struggle of good vs.
   evil, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and all
   people being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from
   several natural locations, and other authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien,
   J. K. Rowling, and William Shakespeare.

   Warriors has received mostly positive reviews, but it has also been
   criticized for being confusing due to its large number of characters
   and complex relationships. Critics have compared it to Brian Jaques's
   Redwall series, although Warriors is written for a lower reading level.
   Although nominated for several awards, the series has not received any
   major literary prizes. However, several novels in the series have
   reached the New York Times Best Seller list, and the series has found
   popularity in many countries.
