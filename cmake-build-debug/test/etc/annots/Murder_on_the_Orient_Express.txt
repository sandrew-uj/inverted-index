   The railway station passenger terminal in Vinkovci, Croatia

   After taking the Taurus Express from Aleppo to Istanbul, private
   detective Hercule Poirot arrives at the Tokatlian Hotel, where he
   receives a telegram prompting him to return to London. He instructs the
   concierge to book him a first-class compartment on the Simplon-route
   Orient Express service leaving that night. Although the train is fully
   booked, Poirot obtains a second-class berth through the intervention of
   friend, fellow Belgian, and passenger Monsieur Bouc, director of the
   Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits railway. Other passengers
   include opinionated American matron Caroline Hubbard; Russian Princess
   Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Swedish
   missionary Greta Ohlsson; vulgar American businessman Samuel Ratchett,
   with his secretary/translator Hector McQueen, and his English butler
   Edward Henry Masterman; Hungarian Count Rudolph Andrenyi and his wife
   Elena; talkative Italian-American car salesman Antonio Foscarelli;
   English Colonel John Arbuthnot; American salesman Cyrus B. Hardman;
   English governess Mary Debenham; and Greek medical doctor Stavros
   Constantine.

   Ratchett recognizes Poirot and asks for his protection as the former
   has been receiving death threats. Poirot, repulsed by Ratchett, refuses
   the case. Bouc has taken the last first-class cabin, but arranges to be
   moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space. The first night,
   Poirot observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, he is
   awakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next door. Pierre Michel,
   the train's conductor, knocks on Ratchett's door, but a voice from
   inside responds, "Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompe" (It is nothing. I
   was mistaken). Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells Michel a man
   passed through her room. When Poirot rings his bell for water, Michel
   informs him that the train is stuck in a snowbank between Vinkovci and
   Brod before he hears a loud thump next door. He observes a woman in a
   red kimono going towards the washroom, then goes to sleep.

   The next morning, with the train still stopped, Bouc informs Poirot
   that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard,
   having no way to escape in the snow. As there are no police onboard,
   Poirot takes up the case. With help from Dr. Constantine, who was in
   the same coach as Bouc and not a suspect, Poirot examines Ratchett's
   body and compartment, discovering the following: the body has 12 stab
   wounds, the window had been left open, a handkerchief with the initial
   "H", a pipe cleaner, a flat match different from the ones Ratchett
   used, and a charred piece of paper with the name "Armstrong" on it.

   The piece of paper helps Poirot work out the murderer's motive. Many
   years earlier, American gangster Lanfranco Cassetti kidnapped
   three-year-old Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a significant ransom
   from the wealthy Armstrong family weeks later, then revealed he had
   killed the child within one hour of kidnapping her. Sonia Armstrong,
   Daisy's mother, who was pregnant with her second child upon hearing the
   news, went into premature labor and died, as did the baby. Her grieving
   husband, Colonel Armstrong, shot himself, and Daisy's French Nursemaid,
   Susanne, was accused of aiding Cassetti and committed suicide, only to
   be found innocent afterwards. Cassetti escaped justice through
   corruption and legal technicalities and fled the country. Poirot
   concludes that "Ratchett" was actually Cassetti. The voice in
   Cassetti's compartment could not have been the American's since the
   gangster did not speak any other languages.

   Poirot begins interviewing everyone on the train and discovers McQueen
   is directly involved as he knows about the Armstrong note and believed
   it was destroyed, and that Mrs. Hubbard believes the murderer was in
   her cabin. While the passengers all provide suitable alibis for each
   other, Poirot notes that some of them observed the woman in the red
   kimono walking down the hallway on the night of the murder. However, no
   one admits to owning a red kimono. Mrs. Hubbard had Ohlsson lock the
   communicating door between her compartment and Cassetti's, which
   invalidates her story of the man in her compartment, and Schmidt bumped
   into a stranger wearing a Wagons-Lits uniform. Miss Debenham
   inadvertently reveals she has been in America, contrary to her earlier
   statements, and Miss Ohlsson shows much emotion when the subject of
   Daisy is brought up, causing further suspicion. Arbuthnot remarks that
   Cassetti should have been found guilty in a second trial instead of
   murdered, and Hardman admits he is actually a MacNeil Agency detective
   who was asked to watch out for an assassin that was stalking Cassetti.

   While inspecting the passengers' luggage, Poirot is surprised to find
   the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet and that her passport
   is damaged, Schmidt's bag contains the uniform in question, and
   Poirot's own luggage contains the red kimono, recently hidden there.
   Mrs. Hubbard herself finds the murder weapon hidden in her sponge bag.
   Poirot meets with Dr. Constantine and Bouc to review the case and
   develop a list of questions. With these and the evidence in mind,
   Poirot thinks about the case, going into a trance-like state. When he
   surfaces from it, he deduces the solution.

   He calls in the suspects and reveals their true identities and that
   they were all connected to the Armstrong tragedy in some way, gathering
   them in the dining car for the second solution. Countess Andrenyi (nee
   Goldenberg) is Helena, Daisy's aunt, who was a child herself at the
   time of the tragedy. Rudolph, her loving husband, smudged her luggage
   label and obscured her name to conceal her identity. Debenham was
   Helena and Daisy's governess; Foscarelli was the Armstrongs' chauffeur,
   at one time also a suspect in the kidnapping; Masterman was Col.
   Armstrong's valet; Michel is Susanne's father and the person who
   procured the false second uniform; Mrs. Hubbard is actually famous
   actress Linda Goldenberg (stage name Arden), Daisy's grandmother and
   Sonia and Helena's mother; Schmidt was the Armstrongs' cook; and
   Ohlsson was Daisy's nurse. Princess Dragomiroff, in reality Sonia's
   godmother, claims the monogrammed handkerchief, saying that her
   forename is Natalia and the "H" is actually a Cyrillic letter "N".
   Arbuthnot is there on Debenham's behalf and his own, as he was a
   personal friend of Colonel Armstrong. Hardman is an ex policeman who
   admits he was in love with Susanne, and McQueen, who had feelings for
   Sonia, was the son of the lawyer who represented the Armstrongs.

   Poirot propounds two possible solutions. The first is that a stranger
   boarded the train when it stopped at Vinkovci, killed Cassetti as a
   result of a Mafia feud, and disembarked at great risk through the snow.
   The second is that all the clues except the handkerchief and pipe
   cleaner were planted and that Michel and all the passengers in the
   coach except Helena stabbed Cassetti, acting as their own jury. Arden
   admits that the second solution is correct, but offers to take
   responsibility as she was the mastermind. In response, Bouc and Dr.
   Constantine accept the first solution and relay this to the police to
   protect the passengers and Michel and avert scandal as Poirot retires
   from the case.
