   Dan and Peter, two youths vacationing on Fire Island, befriend a young
   woman named Sandy, who has found an injured seagull on a beach. While
   nursing the seagull back to health, the three friends spend time
   experimenting with alcohol, marijuana, and their own sexuality. The
   trio make the acquaintance of a slightly younger teenager, Rhoda, a
   shy, plump girl who confides in the others that her mother died in a
   drowning accident. One day, the boys find that Sandy has killed the
   seagull after it bit her. The three older friends pull a prank by
   arranging a dinner date with an older man, Anibal, through a computer
   dating service, getting him drunk, and then abandoning him to a group
   of local bullies, despite Rhoda's protests. Tension builds between
   Rhoda and the three older teens, and in the final sequence Dan, Peter,
   and Sandy pin down Rhoda near the beach as Dan rapes her. After the
   attack, the trio walk away, leaving Rhoda behind near a sand dune.
