   In 2024, Charlie Haskell, the vice president of the United States, is
   on the moon to inaugurate the first moonbase. An interstellar comet is
   discovered to be on course to impact the moon and shatter it. A rescue
   mission gets underway to take the thousand-something population of the
   base off the moon, with the support of the L1 space station (near the
   Earth-Moon L1 point) and Skyport, a larger geocentric space station.

   Haskell, in a moment of zealousness to show responsibility, promises
   the public to get off the moon only after every else has. Subsequent
   analysis reveals that the existing rescue plan would result in about 10
   people not being able to get off the moon before the impact. The VP
   chooses to stick to his promise. Some volunteers, along with a few
   randomly selected people, also stay back.

   The rescue plan moves along, with the help of about 5 large spaceships,
   'SSTOs'. The SSTOs dock with smaller ferry spaceships, 'moonbuses' and
   a 'Micro', in the orbit to take in passengers. Also, a last-minute
   risky plan of using the Micro to take off the last few people is put
   into action and it rescues the last group off the moon just before
   impact.

   The comet hits the moon, shattering it. The resulting debris of loose
   rock creates a danger to the rescue ships, as well as to the people on
   Earth.

   Some impactors, presumably a few hundred meters large, hit the Earth.
   The western hemisphere gets particularly affected because of the
   orientation of Earth during the impact. The coasts of the US are hit by
   multiple tsunamis and the land areas also face some impacts, resulting
   in widespread loss of life and property. The president, who had earlier
   decided against a coastal evacuation, is distraught. Many characters
   who have to deal with these events, like the residents of the affected
   areas, journalists and extremist militia members, are discussed in the
   novel.

   One of the SSTOs gets destroyed in space by a piece of debris measuring
   several hundred meters. The Micro also gets damaged and Haskell is
   forced to perform an EVA to fix the issues, which eventually succeeds.

   The US capital is also subsequently hit by a tsunami, and the president
   dies due to an aircraft malfunction during his rescue. Still in space,
   Haskell takes charge as the president. Haskell and other passengers of
   the Micro, are subsequently rescued by Percival Lowell, a 'nuclear
   powered' ship (presumably nuclear thermal) originally meant for the
   first manned mission to Mars.

   A mile-long piece of the debris, dubbed 'Possum' (from 'Possible
   Impactor'), is discovered to be on course to hit the US mainland, kill
   almost everyone in the US and possibly cause long-term worldwide
   disaster. The option of using nuclear missiles are put on hold due to
   concerns of even worse effects through radioactive fallout. Instead, a
   plan to redirect the Possum into a safe course, using the SSTOs and
   Percival Lowell, is put into action.

   An extremist militia group, with a lack of understanding of the
   impactor and sensing a possibility to take over the governance, damages
   one of the SSTOs, before getting subdued. Nevertheless, with the
   remaining spaceships, the redirection plan is determined to have
   retained the possibility of success.

   The redirection mission gets underway, despite risks like inadequate
   knowledge of the impactor's geology. One SSTO eventually crashes due to
   a geological imperfection in the impactor, midway through the mission.
   After the initial loss of hope, the mission is altered to a last-ditch
   attempt to coax the impactor, which happens to have a flat side, to
   skip off the atmosphere. The mission succeeds to delay the impact by
   several years.

   The epilogue discusses the positive socio-political transformation due
   to the whole event, the steps taken to further deal with the Possum, a
   dedicated impact avoidance strategy, increased emphasis on the space
   program and the first anniversary of 'the birth of Space Age'.
