   Ape and Essence is presented in its entirety, without remark by
   interruption, footnote or afterword. It begins with a vignette
   describing the destruction of the world by nuclear and chemical warfare
   at the hands of intelligent baboons. The two warring sides each have an
   Einstein on a leash which they force to press the button, releasing
   clouds of disease-causing gases toward each other.

   The story then advances to a time 100 years after the catastrophic
   events of World War III, which characters in the book refer to as "the
   Thing", when nuclear and chemical weapons eventually destroyed most of
   human civilisation. In the script's timeframe, radiation has subsided
   to safer levels and in 2107, an exploratory team of New Zealand
   rediscovery scientists (New Zealand was spared from direct nuclear
   attack because it was "of no strategic importance") travel to
   California.

   Meanwhile, a strange society has emerged from the radiation and three
   of its men capture one of the scientists (Dr. Poole). Dr. Poole is
   introduced to an illiterate society which survives by "mining" graves
   for clothes, burning library books as fuel, and killing off newborns
   deformed by radiation (that is, newborns with over three pairs of
   nipples and more than seven toes or fingers) to preserve genetic
   purity. The society has also taken to worshipping Satan, whom they
   refer to as "Belial", and limiting reproduction to an annual two-week
   orgy which begins on "Belial's Day Eve" after the deformed babies are
   "purified by blood".

   The story climaxes during the purification ceremonies of Belial's Day
   Eve with an intellectual confrontation between Dr. Poole and the
   arch-vicar, the head of the Church of Belial. During the conversation
   the arch-vicar reveals that there is a minority of "hots" who do not
   express an interest in the post-World War III style of reproduction,
   but they are severely punished to keep them in line. In exchange for
   his life, Dr. Poole agrees to do what he can as a botanist to help
   increase their crops yields, but about a year later he escapes with
   Loola in search of the community of "hots" that is rumoured to exist
   north of the desert.

   The script--and the novel--end with Dr. Poole and Loola in the desert
   north of Los Angeles, breaking their trek by a tombstone which bears
   the author's name of Tallis, the dates 1882-1948, and three lines from
   the antepenultimate verse of Percy Bysshe Shelley's elegy on the death
   of John Keats. Lest Loola find it sad, Dr. Poole, happily possessed of
   a duodecimo Shelley, reads her the poem's penultimate verse:

   That Light whose smile kindles the Universe
   That Beauty in which all things work and move
   That Benediction, which the eclipsing Curse
   Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love,
   Which through the web of being blindly wove
   By man and beast and earth and air and sea,
   Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of
   The fire for which all thirst, now beams on me
   Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.
