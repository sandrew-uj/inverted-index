   Taking place eight years after the events of Count Zero and fifteen
   years after Neuromancer, the story is formed from several
   interconnecting plot threads, and also features characters from
   Gibson's previous works (such as Molly Millions, the razor-fingered
   mercenary from Neuromancer).

   Thread one: concerns Mona, a teen prostitute who has a
   more-than-passing resemblance to famed Simstim superstar Angie
   Mitchell. Mona is hired by shady individuals for a "gig" which later
   turns out to be part of a plot to abduct Angie.

   Thread two: focuses on a young Japanese girl named Kumiko, daughter of
   a Yakuza boss sent to London to keep her safe while her father engages
   in a gang war with other top Yakuza leaders. In London, she is cared
   for by one of her father's retainers, who is also a powerful member of
   the London Mob. She meets Molly Millions (having altered her appearance
   and now calling herself "Sally Shears", in order to conceal her
   identity from hostile parties who are implied to be pursuing her), who
   takes the girl under her wing.

   Thread three: follows a reclusive artist named Slick Henry, who lives
   in a place named Factory in the Dog Solitude; a large, poisoned expanse
   of deserted factories and dumps, probably in southern New Jersey. Slick
   Henry is a convicted car thief whose punishment consisted of having his
   short-term memory erased every five minutes, leading to continuous
   confusion and dissociation. Following the end of his sentence, he
   spends his days creating large robotic sculptures and periodically
   suffers episodes of time loss, returning to consciousness afterward
   with no memory of what he did during the blackout. He is hired by an
   acquaintance to look after the comatose "Count" (Bobby Newmark from the
   second novel, Count Zero, who has hooked himself into a super-capacity
   cyber-harddrive called an Aleph). A theoretical "Aleph" would have the
   RAM capacity to literally contain all of reality, enough that a memory
   construct of a person would contain the complete personality of the
   individual and allow it to learn, grow and act independently.

   The final plotline follows Angela Mitchell, famous simstim star, and
   the girl from the second Sprawl novel Count Zero. Angie, thanks to
   brain manipulations by her father when she was a child, has always had
   the ability to access cyberspace directly (without a cyberspace deck),
   but drugs provided by her production company Sense/Net have severely
   impeded this ability.

   The plot culminates when Angie and Bobby "upload" their consciousness
   into the Aleph; Mona takes Angie's place as a simstim star following
   forced cosmetic surgery to make Mona look identical to Angie.
