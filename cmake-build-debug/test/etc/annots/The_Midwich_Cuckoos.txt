   Ambulances arrive at two traffic accidents blocking the only roads into
   the (fictional) British village of Midwich, Winshire. Attempting to
   approach the village, one ambulanceman becomes unconscious. Suspecting
   gas poisoning, the army is notified. They discover that a caged canary
   becomes unconscious upon entering the affected region, but regains
   consciousness when removed. Further experiments reveal the region to be
   a hemisphere with a diameter of 2 miles (3.2 km) around the village.
   Aerial photography shows an unidentifiable silvery object on the ground
   in the centre of the affected zone.

   After one day the effect vanishes, along with the unidentified object,
   and the villagers wake with no apparent ill effects. Some months later
   they realise that every woman of child-bearing age is pregnant -- even
   those who are single or not otherwise in relationships with men -- with
   all indications that the pregnancies were caused by xenogenesis during
   the period of unconsciousness that has come to be referred to as the
   "Dayout".

   When the 31 boys and 30 girls are born they appear normal, except for
   their unusual, golden eyes, light blonde hair, and pale, silvery skin.
   These children have none of the genetic characteristics of their
   mothers. As they grow up, it becomes increasingly apparent that they
   are, at least in some respects, not human. They possess telepathic
   abilities, and can control others' actions. The Children (they are
   referred to with a capital C) have two distinct group minds: one for
   the boys, and another for the girls. Their physical development is
   accelerated compared with that of humans; upon reaching the age of
   nine, they appear to be sixteen-year-olds.

   The Children protect themselves as much as possible using a form of
   mind-control. One young man who accidentally hits a Child in the hip
   while driving a car is made to drive into a wall and kill himself. A
   bull that chased the Children is forced into a pond to drown. The
   villagers form a mob and try to burn down the Midwich Grange where the
   Children are taught and live, but the Children make the villagers
   attack each other.

   The Military Intelligence department learns that the same phenomenon
   has occurred in four other parts of the world, including an Inuit
   settlement in the Canadian Arctic, a small township in Australia's
   Northern Territory, a Mongolian village, and the town of Gizhinsk in
   eastern Russia, northeast of Okhotsk. The Inuit killed the newborn
   Children, sensing they were not their own, and the Mongolians killed
   the Children and their mothers. The Australian babies had all died
   within a few weeks, suggesting that something may have gone wrong with
   the xenogenesis process. The Russian town was recently "accidentally"
   destroyed by the Soviet government, using an "atomic cannon" from a
   range of 50-60 miles.

   The Children are aware of the threat against them, and use their power
   to prevent any aeroplanes from flying over the village. During an
   interview with a Military Intelligence officer, the Children explain
   that to solve the problem they must be destroyed. They explain it is
   not possible to kill them unless the entire village is bombed, which
   would result in civilian deaths. The Children present an ultimatum:
   they want to migrate to a secure location, where they can live
   unharmed. They demand aeroplanes from the government.

   An elderly, educated, Midwich resident (Gordon Zellaby) realises the
   Children must be killed as soon as possible. As he has only a few weeks
   left to live due to a heart condition, he feels an obligation to do
   something. He has acted as a teacher of and mentor to the Children, and
   they regard him with as much affection as they can have for any human,
   permitting him to approach them more closely than they allow others.
   One evening, he hides a bomb in his projection equipment while showing
   the Children a film about the Greek islands. Zellaby sets off the bomb,
   killing himself and all of the Children.
