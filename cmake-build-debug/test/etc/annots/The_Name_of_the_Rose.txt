   In 1327, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville and Adso of Melk, a
   Benedictine novice travelling under his protection, arrive at a
   Benedictine monastery in Northern Italy to attend a theological
   disputation. This abbey is being used as neutral ground in a dispute
   between Pope John XXII and the Franciscans, who are suspected of
   heresy.

   The monastery is disturbed by the death of Adelmo of Otranto, an
   illuminator revered for his illustrations. Adelmo was skilled at
   comical artwork, especially concerning religious matters. William is
   asked by the monastery's abbot, Abo of Fossanova, to investigate the
   death: During his enquiry he has a debate with one of the oldest monks
   in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the theological meaning of
   laughter, which Jorge despises.

   The next day, a scholar of Aristotle and translator of Greek and
   Arabic, Venantius of Salvemec, is found dead in a vat of pig's blood.
   Severinus of Sankt Wendel, the herbalist, tells William that
   Venantius's body had black stains on the tongue and fingers, which
   suggests poison. Benno of Uppsala, a rhetoric scholar, reveals to
   William that the librarian, Malachi of Hildesheim, and his assistant
   Berengar of Arundel, had a homosexual relationship, until Berengar
   seduced Adelmo, who committed suicide out of conflicting religious
   shame. The only other monks who knew about the indiscretions were Jorge
   and Venantius. In spite of Malachi prohibiting William and Adso from
   entering the labyrinthine library, they penetrate the labyrinth,
   discovering that there must be a hidden room, entitled the finis
   Africae after the presumed geographical edge of the world. They find a
   book on Venantius' desk along with some cryptic notes. Someone snatches
   the book, and they pursue to no avail.

   By the day after, Berengar has gone missing, which puts pressure on
   William. William learns of how Salvatore of Montferrat, and Remigio of
   Varagine, two cellarer monks, had a history with the Dulcinian
   heretics. Adso returns to the library alone in the evening. When
   leaving the library through the kitchen, Adso is seduced by a peasant
   girl, with whom he has his first sexual experience. After confessing to
   William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty.

   On the fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in a bath, although his
   body bears stains similar to Venantius'. Bernard Gui, a member of the
   Inquisition, arrives to search for the murderer via papal decree. Gui
   arrests the peasant girl Adso loved, as well as Salvatore, accusing
   them both of heresy and witchcraft.

   During the theological disputation the next day, Severinus, after
   obtaining a "strange" book, is found dead in his laboratory, prompting
   William and Adso to search unsuccessfully for it. Remigio is
   interrogated by Gui, who scares him into revealing his heretical past,
   as well as falsely confessing to the crimes of the Abbey under threat
   of torture. In response to the recent tragedies in the abbey, Jorge
   leads a sermon about the coming of the Antichrist.

   Malachi, near death, returns to the early sermon on the sixth day, and
   his final words concern scorpions. Nicholas of Morimondo, the glazier,
   tells William that whoever is the librarian would then become the
   Abbot, and with new light, William goes to the library to search for
   evidence. The Abbot is distraught that William has not solved the
   crime, and that the Inquisition is undermining him, so he dismisses
   William. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more
   and enters the finis Africae by solving its etymological riddle by
   chance.

   William and Adso discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room.
   He confesses that he has been masterminding the Abbey for decades, and
   his last victim is the Abbot himself, who has been trapped to suffocate
   inside a second passage to the chamber. William asks Jorge for the
   second book of Aristotle's Poetics, which Jorge gladly offers. While
   flipping through the pages, which speak of the virtues of laughter,
   William deduces that Jorge - unable to destroy this last copy of the
   book - laced the pages with arsenic, assuming correctly that a reader
   would have to lick his fingers to turn them. Furthermore, William
   concludes that Venantius was translating the book as he succumbed to
   the poison. Berengar found him and, fearing exposure, disposed of the
   body in pig's blood before claiming the book and dying in the baths.
   Malachi was coaxed by Jorge to retrieve it from Severinus' storage,
   where Berengar had displaced it, so he killed Severinus, retrieved the
   book and died after investigating its contents. Jorge confirms
   William's deductions and justifies this unlikely course of actions as
   part of a divine plan.

   The deaths correspond in order and symbolism with the Seven Trumpets,
   which call for objects falling from the sky (Adelmo's jump from a
   tower), pools of blood (Venantius), poison from water (Berengar),
   bashing of the stars (Severinus' head was crushed with a celestial
   orb), scorpions (which a delirious Malachi referred to), locusts and
   fire. This sequence, interpreted throughout the plot (to the verge of
   being accepted by William himself) as the deliberate work of a serial
   killer, was in fact the random result of Jorge's scheme. He consumes
   the book's poisoned pages and uses Adso's lantern to start a fire,
   which kills him and burns down the library. Adso summons the monks in a
   futile attempt to extinguish the fire. As the fire spreads to the rest
   of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated,
   William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns
   to the ruins of the abbey and salvages any remaining book scraps and
   fragments from the fire, eventually creating a lesser library.
