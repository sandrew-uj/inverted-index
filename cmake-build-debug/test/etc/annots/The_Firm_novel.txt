   Mitch McDeere is a graduate of Western Kentucky University with a
   degree in accounting, who has passed his Certified Public Accountant
   exam on the first attempt and graduated third in his class at Harvard
   Law School. Mitch is married to his high school sweetheart, Abby
   Sutherland, an elementary school teacher who also attended Western
   Kentucky University. His older brother Ray is imprisoned in Tennessee
   for manslaughter, and his other brother, Rusty, died in Vietnam.

   Mitch spurns offers from law firms in New York and Chicago in favor of
   signing with Bendini, Lambert and Locke, a small tax law firm based in
   Memphis. He finds the firm's offer -- a large salary, a lease on a new
   BMW, and a low-interest mortgage on a house -- too generous to resist.
   Soon after he joins, his new colleagues help him study and pass his bar
   exam, the first priority for new associates. Mitch is assigned to
   partner Avery Tolar, the firm's "bad boy," but a highly accomplished
   attorney.

   Two of Mitch's colleagues, Marty Kozinski and Joe Hodge, die in a scuba
   diving accident in the Cayman Islands a few days before he starts at
   the firm. On his first scheduled day of work, Mitch attends their
   funerals. Mitch finds the deaths unsettling, but focuses on his goal of
   becoming the youngest partner in the firm's history. During a memorial
   service at the firm for the two deceased attorneys, Mitch notices
   plaques commemorating three other attorneys who died while working at
   the firm. Suspicious, he hires a private investigator, Eddie Lomax, an
   ex-cellmate of his brother Ray, to investigate the deaths.

   Lomax discovers that the other three deceased attorneys died under
   suspicious circumstances: in a car accident, a hunting accident, and a
   suicide. While the details of their deaths don't add up, nothing
   concrete was ever proven. Lomax cautions Mitch to be careful. Soon
   after delivering his report to Mitch, Lomax is murdered. FBI agent
   Wayne Tarrance confronts Mitch, telling him the FBI is watching the
   firm.

   While in Washington, D.C. on business, the FBI approaches Mitch again.
   The FBI reveals that the firm is a white collar front for the Morolto
   crime family of Chicago. The firm's founder, Anthony Bendini, was the
   son-in-law of old man Morolto. He founded the firm in 1944, and for
   almost half a century, the firm has lured young lawyers from humble
   backgrounds with the promise of prestige and financial security.
   Although Mitch's work so far has been legitimate, the partners and
   senior associates are deeply immersed in a massive tax fraud and money
   laundering operation that accounts for as much as 75 percent of the
   firm's business. By the time members of the firm become aware of its
   true nature, they cannot leave. No lawyer has escaped the firm alive;
   the five who tried were killed to keep them from talking. Kozinski and
   Hodge were actually in contact with the FBI at the time of their
   murders.

   Mitch learns that his house, office, and car are bugged. The FBI tells
   Mitch that in order to get enough evidence to bring down the firm, he
   must reveal information about his clients. The attorney-client
   privilege in most U.S. states, including Tennessee, does not apply
   to situations when a lawyer knows that a crime is taking place.
   However, if Mitch cooperates, he will have to reveal information about
   some of his legitimate clients as well, which will all but end his
   legal career. The FBI warns Mitch that he will almost certainly go to
   prison if he chooses to ignore them. The firm also ramps up the
   pressure on Mitch; the firm's security chief, DeVasher, suspects he is
   getting too close to the FBI. Desperate to find a way out and stay
   alive in the process, Mitch has to make a decision quickly.

   Ultimately, Mitch and Abby decide to cooperate with the FBI. However,
   they secretly decide to flee after turning over enough evidence to
   topple the firm, since they don't completely trust the FBI to protect
   them. He promises to collect enough evidence to bring down the firm in
   return for $2 million and Ray's release from prison. Working with
   Lomax's secretary and lover, Tammy Hemphill, Mitch obtains several
   confidential documents from the firm's bank records in the Cayman
   Islands, eventually copying over 10,000 documents detailing over 20
   years of illegal transactions.

   Mitch tells Tarrance that while these documents spell out only a
   fraction of the firm's criminal activities, they contain enough
   evidence to indict roughly half the firm's active members and several
   retired partners immediately. However, the documents will also provide
   strong circumstantial evidence that the firm is part and parcel of a
   criminal conspiracy. This will give the FBI probable cause to obtain a
   search warrant for the firm's building in downtown Memphis and with it,
   access to all of the firm's dirty files. Mitch is certain those files
   will provide enough evidence for a massive RICO indictment that will
   bring down the firm and cripple the Morolto family.

   Meanwhile, the firm becomes suspicious of Mitch. Tarry Ross, alias
   "Alfred," a top FBI official and close confidant of Voyles who is
   actually a mole for another crime family, confirms that Mitch is indeed
   working with the FBI. Once Mitch learns of the leak, he flees to Panama
   City Beach, Florida with his brother and wife with the Moroltos and FBI
   chasing them. On the way, he steals $10 million from one of the firm's
   Grand Cayman bank accounts, sending some of the money to his mother and
   in-laws, depositing some in a Swiss bank account, and leaving the rest
   for Tammy.

   Mitch, Abby and Ray manage to escape to the Cayman Islands with the
   help of Barry Abanks, a scuba diving business owner from the islands
   whose son died in the incident which killed Kozinski and Hodge. Armed
   with Mitch's evidence, the FBI indicts 51 present and former members of
   the Bendini firm, as well as 31 alleged members of the Morolto family,
   for everything from money laundering to mail fraud. As the book ends,
   Mitch, Abby and Ray enjoy their newfound wealth in the Cayman Islands.
