   John Carter's descendants

   The stories in this collection revolve around John Carter's
   granddaughter Llana of Gathol, who plays the "damsel in distress" role
   played by Dejah Thoris and Thuvia in earlier entries of the Barsoom
   series.

   In search of solitude, John Carter flies to the deserted city of Horz.
   By one of those coincidences which are common in Burroughs's books, he
   discovers his own granddaughter, Llana of Gathol, who is being held
   captive. The subsequent attempts to get Llana safely back home bring
   Carter, Llana and Pan Dan Chee, a young man they pick up along the way,
   through a series of adventures. They meet an ancient, mad hypnotist who
   has preserved people for nearly a million years by the power of
   hypnotism. They find a valley occupied by Black Men who imprison them.
   They travel to the land of Pankor where soldiers are frozen and kept in
   reserve until needed for a war. Finally they reach the land of Invak
   where the inhabitants have mastered the art of invisibility.
