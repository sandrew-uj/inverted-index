   Lud-in-the-Mist (1926) is the third and final novel by British writer
   Hope Mirrlees. It continues the author's exploration of the themes of
   Life and Art, by a method already described in the preface of her first
   novel, Madeleine: One of Love's Jansenists (1919): "to turn from time
   to time upon the action the fantastic limelight of eternity, with a
   sudden effect of unreality and the hint of a world within a world".

   Whereas in the novels Madeleine and The Counterplot Mirrlees adapted
   elements from history, religions and literature, her use of a
   secondary-world setting in Lud-in-the-Mist associates it with the
   tradition of high fantasy, and thereby with its current popularity. In
   1970 an American reprint was published without the author's permission,
   as part of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series. It was reprinted
   subsequently by Orion Books in 2000 as part of their Fantasy
   Masterworks series.^[1] A more recent republication by the Cold Spring
   Press includes a foreword by Neil Gaiman and an introduction by Douglas
   A. Anderson.^[2] A new edition from Prologue Books was published in
   2013.^[3]

   Lud-in-the-Mist's unconventional elements, responsible for its appeal
   to the fantasy readership, are understood better if they are analyzed
   in the context of her whole oeuvre. In this novel, the prosaic and
   law-abiding inhabitants of Lud-in-the-Mist, a city located at the
   confluence of the rivers Dapple and Dawl, in the fictional state of
   Dorimare, must contend with the influx of fairy fruit and the effect of
   the fantastic inhabitants of the bordering land of Faerie, whose
   presence and very existence they had sought to banish from their
   rational lives. When the denial proves futile, their mayor, the
   respectable Nathaniel Chanticleer, finds himself involved reluctantly
   with the conflict and obliged to change his conventional personal life
   and disregard the traditions of Lud-in-the-Mist to find a
   reconciliation.^[4]

   Lud-in-the-Mist begins with a quotation by Jane Harrison, with whom
   Mirrlees lived in London and Paris, and whose influence is also found
   in Madeleine and The Counterplot. The book is dedicated to the memory
   of Mirrlees's father.
