   Danny uses a computer that Professor Bullfinch has created for NASA to
   prepare his homework, despite Professor Bullfinch's warning that Danny
   is to leave the machine alone. With his friend Joe Pearson and his new
   neighbor, Irene Miller, Danny has some success with the machine before
   it is sabotaged. Danny figures out what is wrong with the machine and
   corrects the problem. Danny's teacher also learns about the machine,
   and has her ideas for the Homework Champions. Once she finds out, she
   thinks of a way to trick the kids.
