   The story involves three children of our own world transported to the
   world of Vandarei and there separated; the older boy, Oliver, is
   adopted by horse-lords, and in a peculiar time-dilation effect grows to
   adulthood among them, forgetting his origins, while his younger
   siblings, taken in by the princess In'serinna, remain children and
   pursue their own quest. All their adventures are part of a larger
   effort to defeat Satan.
