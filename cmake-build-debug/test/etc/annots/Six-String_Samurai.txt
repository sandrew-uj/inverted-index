   In 1957, the Soviet Union attacks the United States with nuclear
   weapons, rendering most of the nation uninhabitable. The American
   government has collapsed with the exception of the haven known as Lost
   Vegas, ruled by King Elvis. The Red Army has been besieging Lost Vegas,
   but the lack of supplies over the years has relegated them to a gang of
   thugs. Forty years later King Elvis dies and radio disc jockey Keith
   Mortimer announces a call for all musicians to come to Lost Vegas to
   try to become the new King of Rock 'n' Roll. The ending of His message,
   "Vegas needs a new King!"

   Buddy, a lone guitarist and swordsman, saves an unnamed boy he simply
   calls "Kid" from a group of bandits; consequently, as the Kid's mother
   was killed by the bandits he tags along with Buddy much to the latter's
   annoyance. As the duo travel through the desert wasteland, the heavy
   metal-playing Death stages several attempts to prevent Buddy from
   reaching Lost Vegas alive and claim the throne for himself. After
   enduring an attack by a bounty-hunting bowling team, Buddy and the Kid
   steal a car from another musician to continue their journey. They are
   later attacked on the road by bandits but escape.

   When their car breaks down, Buddy and the Kid attempt to borrow a
   wrench from a suburban family, unaware that they are cannibals. Buddy
   leaves the Kid with them and takes off on foot. The Kid is about to be
   eaten but is spared after a group of Windmill People invade the home
   and the family flees with Buddy and the Kid's abandoned car after
   revealing they had a socket wrench needed to fix it. Buddy returns to
   defeat the Windmill People, the two reunite and continue their journey
   on an abandoned motorcycle. Meanwhile, Death has been killing off all
   other musicians coming across his path and taking their guitar picks as
   trophies.

   Buddy and the Kid arrive in the town of Fallout, where he leaves the
   Kid with some locals and enters a bar to drink and spend time with a
   cheerleader. Death arrives but the Kid warns Buddy in time for them to
   flee. Before they do Buddy is approached by a young guitarist, whom he
   then humiliates. Continuing their travel, Buddy is attacked by the
   guitarist. Buddy unintentionally kills him in self defense, and,
   feeling guilty, he lays his sword down and walks away, but the Kid
   brings it back to him, still believing in Buddy and helping regain his
   confidence. Eventually the two begin to bond closer. Later, after they
   collapse in the desert, they are ambushed by Death and his bandmates, a
   trio of archers. Buddy slides the Kid and his guitar to safety while he
   battles the archers, but when the Kid is captured by a group of
   underground mutants, Buddy pursues the mutants to their lair. Death
   decides not to follow him as there are other musicians left to kill
   saving Buddy for last.

   Buddy manages to save the Kid, and after returning to the surface, they
   find their road to Vegas blocked by the Red Army. After a grueling
   battle, Buddy is injured with the Kid dragging him to continue. Death
   finally catches up to them and engages Buddy in a guitar duel clashing
   their styles of music against one another; Buddy, Rock 'n' Roll and
   Death, Heavy Metal. When Buddy proves the better guitarist, an angry
   Death orders his bandmates to shoot him and the Kid with their bows.
   Buddy shields the Kid, getting shot in the back, but rises up and
   battles Death in a sword fight. Death mortally wounds Buddy in the end
   but the Kid discovers water is Death's weakness after spitting at him.
   The Kid then melts Death away with his water canteen.

   With his defeat, Death's bandmates are in shock that the Kid bested
   him. They give him a card and tell him with admiration that if he ever
   needs them to call them, and they take their leave. The Kid, saddened
   by Buddy disappearing after dying, bravely accepts to finish Buddy's
   journey. He puts on his clothes and glasses, and carries his sword and
   guitar. With Lost Vegas now in sight, the Kid has completed Buddy's
   dream, and the film ends with him turning into Buddy, symbolizing he's
   inherited His spirit as a crowd cheers him from Lost Vegas.
