   In 2020, Britain is ruled by the Knights of God, a fascist religious
   order - founded by the Prior Mordrin (Woodvine) - that came to power
   during a brutal civil war that began in 2000, during which the Royal
   Family were supposedly all slaughtered by Hugo (Fellowes) and the
   civilian government collapsed leaving the Knights free to step into the
   power vacuum. Mordrin has renamed the south of England "Anglia", while
   the north and Scotland - which has only recently been brought under
   control - he calls "Northumbria." In between is the "Wasteland", the
   former industrial regions of Lancashire and southern Yorkshire, where
   the remaining resistance fighters - regarded as terrorists by the
   Knights - are still at large. For the time being Mordrin sees the
   Wasteland as a convenient buffer to communications and travel between
   Anglia and Northumbria. Winchester is temporarily serving as the
   nation's capital, as most of London was destroyed in the war and
   reconstruction work is hampered by lack of resources.

   Gervase Owen Edwards (Winter) has grown up in Wales, which has finally
   succumbed to the rule of the Knights, although the resistance led by
   his father, Owen (Thomas), remains active. When most civilians in Wales
   are interned for not showing sufficient enthusiasm for the end of the
   war and loyalty to the Knights, Gervase is sent to a "re-education and
   training camp," initially accompanied by Owen disguised as a Knight,
   who tells him that it is important that he lives. During the journey,
   Gervase meets an English girl, Julia Clarke (Parker).

   Mordrin becomes obsessed with the idea of destroying the leader of all
   the resistance to him, and when Gervase is identified as Owen's son,
   Mordrin threatens to execute Julia unless he denounces his father and
   joins the Knights of God. After he agrees, Mordrin uses mind-altering
   drugs to place the post-hypnotic suggestion in Gervase's mind that he
   should seek out and destroy the Prior's "greatest enemy." He is then
   released, ostensibly to be allowed to find Julia, who has escaped from
   the camp. Unknown to Gervase, Mordrin needs Julia alive as well, as she
   is the daughter of Brigadier Clarke, the senior officer in the
   Coldstream Guards, the last remnant of the British Army, which has been
   allowed to survive for ceremonial purposes, all other units having been
   absorbed into the Knights. Meanwhile, Hugo plots to overthrow Mordrin
   and take power himself, and sends his own agents to intercept and kill
   Gervase.

   After Gervase finds Julia, they are ambushed and captured by English
   resistance fighters led by Colley (Henderson). Gervase is then put on
   trial for killing one of Colley's men during the ambush, and is found
   guilty and sentenced to death. Owen threatens to use his own men to
   free his son, but Arthur - who it is revealed is Mordrin's father
   (reminiscent of King Arthur and Sir Mordred) - intercedes and publicly
   banishes Gervase to the Wasteland, while secretly tasking him with
   finding the one surviving member of the Royal Family - a King to unite
   the country against the Knights. Mordrin becomes increasingly paranoid,
   and secretly plans to declare himself King, and even commissions the
   manufacture of a new crown.

   Realising the threat Hugo represents, Mordrin has him arrested, but he
   escapes to London as dissident Knights flock to join him. Gervase and
   Julia travel to Canterbury, an enclave where the Anglican Church is
   allowed to survive. Mordrin issues orders for them to be intercepted,
   but they are "captured" and taken into the city by Brigadier Clarke and
   his men, disguised as Knights.

   It is revealed that Gervase himself is the King, and it is only his
   love for Julia that prevents him from obeying Mordrin's command by
   killing himself. Hugo's faction attacks Mordrin's headquarters, and the
   resistance - bolstered by the defecting Coldstream Guards - prepares to
   finish off whoever is left. Owen slips away, having previously vowed to
   kill Mordrin for what he did to Gervase, but is shot and injured in the
   battle between the Knights. Hugo corners Mordrin, but is killed
   himself, and the Prior escapes with his crown into surrounding forest.
   As he prepared to place the crown on his own head, Mordrin is shot by
   the mortally injured Owen, who then himself dies. When the battle is
   over, Arthur takes the crown from Mordrin's dead hand and presents it
   to Gervase, telling him to rule wisely.
