   The novel comprises two phases in the same space that are separated by
   220 years of time. Its central conceit is that Humans evolved from the
   juvenile stage of the Pak, a species with a distinct adult form
   ("protectors") that has immense strength and intelligence and cares
   only about younger Pak of their bloodline. A key plot point is that
   transition to the protector stage is mediated by consumption of the
   root of a particular plant called Tree-of-Life, which cannot be
   effectively cultivated on Earth.

   The first half of the book follows the path of a Pak named Phssthpok
   who has travelled from the Pak homeworld in search of a colony of Pak
   in the distant system of Sol (our Solar System). Upon his arrival, he
   captures a Belter (a worker from the asteroid belt) named Jack Brennan,
   who is infected by Phssthpok's store of tree-of-life root and is
   transformed into a protector (or at least a Human variant). They land
   on Mars where Brennan kills Phssthpok and is rescued by two Humans,
   Nick Sohl and Lucas Garner, who had set out to meet the alien. The
   first half of the novel ends with Brennan telling his story to the
   Humans before he heads for the outer reaches of the solar system.

   The second half of the book follows the path of a Human named Roy
   Truesdale who has been abducted with no memory of the event. While
   searching for his abductor, he befriends a Belter named Alice Jordan
   who helps him figure out that the man he has sought is none other than
   Jack Brennan. Truesdale and Jordan find Brennan in the outer solar
   system on a fabricated world of Brennan's design called Kobold. Brennan
   discovers that a Pak invasion fleet is headed towards human space and
   takes Truesdale to a Human outpost colony called Home in an effort to
   divert attention away from Earth. During their journey they battle with
   scout ships from the Pak fleet. Brennan and Truesdale arrive at Home
   only to have Truesdale realize that Brennan plans to convert the colony
   into a defensive Human Protector army. Truesdale kills Brennan and
   lands on Home, but is himself infected with a mutated strain of the
   Tree-of-Life virus that quickly spreads to a number of other colonists,
   thus carrying out Brennan's plan despite Truesdale's initial attempts
   to thwart it. Upon his conversion to protector form, Truesdale
   immediately comes to view Brennan's plan as necessary and completes it
   by breaking out of hospital confinement and infecting the entire
   population of Home. The modified virus either kills or converts the
   remaining inhabitants, resulting in an army of childless protectors.
   The new protectors think that they absolutely must act quickly to save
   the rest of Humanity, and start preparing for battle with the Pak
   invasion fleet.

   As an aside, it is mentioned that during his sojourn in the outer Solar
   System Brennan had engineered a genocide on Mars, sending a large ice
   asteroid to crash into the planet in order to raise the water content
   of its atmosphere. Water is lethal to the Martians' metabolism, thus
   this effectively wiped out the species. This incident serves to
   underscore the Pak Protectors' inherent xenophobia and utter
   ruthlessness in pursuing their ultimate goal of protecting their
   descendants.

   The events which impelled Brennan to this action are those narrated in
   How the Heroes Die and At the Bottom of a Hole, two short 1966 stories
   which Niven originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction and later
   collected in Inconstant Moon. As depicted in these stories, there were
   two incidents in which Martians killed some humans who landed on their
   world, after which humans just left Mars alone. In the mind of the
   Protector Brennan - committed to defending humans and having no
   consideration whatever for others - that was sufficient reason to
   exterminate the entire species.
