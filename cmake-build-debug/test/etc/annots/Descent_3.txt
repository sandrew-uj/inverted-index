   Descent 3 takes place in a science fiction setting of the Solar System
   where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a mercenary
   working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation
   (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with
   the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he
   was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to
   return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with
   the prototype warp drive in the ship he was piloting, making it drift
   towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material
   Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the
   Red Acropolis Research Team.

   While the Material Defender recovers in the Red Acropolis station on
   Mars, the director of the team informs him that they have been
   investigating PTMC, and have uncovered a conspiracy: one of her
   acquaintances in the PTMC was killed by a robot, and when she contacted
   PTMC about it, they denied having ever employed such acquaintance, even
   though he had worked with them for years. The Red Acropolis had tried
   to notify the Collective Earth Defense (CED), a large police group, of
   the PTMC's actions, but they took no action, not daring to interfere
   with such a powerful corporation. The director also tells the Material
   Defender that, while he was clearing the mines during the events of
   Descent II, PTMC executive Samuel Dravis was actually testing and
   modifying the virus and deliberately tried to kill him by overloading
   the warp drive on his ship. After some persuasion and offers from the
   director, including a new ship and an AI assistant known as the
   Guide-Bot, the Material Defender accepts to help the Red Acropolis stop
   the virus.

   The Material Defender is first sent to Deimos to obtain information
   about the location of a scientist named Dr. Sweitzer who has evidence
   of the PTMC's actions. He is then rescued in the Novak Corporate Prison
   on Phobos. After recovering the evidence, the Material Defender
   delivers it to PTMC President Suzuki in Seoul before leaving with his
   reward. When the Material Defender arrives at the Red Acropolis
   Research Station, the director tells him that the PTMC president has
   been killed and that the Red Acropolis Research Team are now accused of
   being terrorists, resulting in the destruction of the then-abandoned
   station. After a series of missions, the Material Defender and the
   Red Acropolis Research Team manage to develop an antivirus and convince
   the CED that they are not terrorists. The CED suggest to broadcast the
   antivirus through their strategic platform orbiting Earth, but the
   results are unsuccessful. The Material Defender is then sent to Venus,
   where Dravis has been tracked by the Red Acropolis. In the ensuing
   confrontation in his stronghold, Dravis is mortally wounded by the
   Guide-Bot's flares and the Material Defender deactivates the virus,
   which disables all of the PTMC's robots. The game ends with the CED
   destroying the PTMC's orbital headquarters while the Material Defender
   returns to Earth.
