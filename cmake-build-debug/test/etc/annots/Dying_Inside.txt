   The novel's main character, David Selig, is an undistinguished man
   living in New York City. David was born with a telepathic gift allowing
   him to read minds. Rather than use his ability for any greater good,
   however, Selig squanders his power, using it only for his own
   convenience. At the beginning of the novel, David earns a living by
   reading the minds of college students so that he can better plagiarize
   reports and essays on their behalf.

   As the novel progresses, Selig's power becomes continually weaker,
   working sporadically and sometimes not at all, and Selig struggles to
   maintain his grip on reality as he begins to lose an ability on which
   he has long since grown dependent.^[3]

   The book contains a number of memorable elements, such as David's
   relationship with a fellow telepath he meets as a young adult, or his
   strained interaction with his estranged younger sister (who has long
   distrusted him because of his ability), or his obsession, during one
   section of the novel, with proving that his girlfriend, a woman named
   Kitty, is also telepathic after he discovers that he can't read her
   mind. There is also a moment where David's power causes him to
   vicariously experience his girlfriend's acid trip, and a bravura
   sequence in which the adolescent Selig, during a visit to a farm,
   enters the minds of, variously, a fish swimming in a stream, a hen
   laying an egg, and a young couple in the midst of passionate sex.
