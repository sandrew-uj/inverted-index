   Walter Hansman has just graduated from Schiaparelli Space Academy on
   Mars in June 2150. His father, Dr. George W. Hansman, sends a telegram
   telling him to return to Terra immediately. Finding that he
   automatically has all of the necessary permissions from the Terrestrial
   Space Navy, he goes to Red Sands Spaceport, where he boards the Space
   Ship Fafnir for his journey home.

   On the ship he finds that Don Salter, a classmate from Schiaparelli, is
   also going to Terra on mysterious orders. Together the two young men
   help prepare SS Fafnir for launch and then help around the ship on the
   long flight to Terra. Finally the ship lands at Peak City Spaceport, at
   the foot of the Rocky Mountains, and the men find their fathers waiting
   for them.

   Taken to a small, closed-off spaceport, Walt and Don are told that they
   are to participate in the construction and flight of humanity's first
   interstellar spaceship, one equipped with a space-warping hyperdrive.
   After extensive physical and psychological testing, Don is assigned to
   work on the starship's propulsion and Walt is to help develop the
   control circuits. When the ship is complete and ready for flight, she
   is christened with the name of Magellan's ship, Vittoria, and prepared
   for a trial run to Pluto.

   Under inertial drive Vittoria rises into space and accelerates to a
   speed close to the speed of light. The crew then engages the "high
   drive", which pushes the ship into hyperspace, enabling the ship, in
   essence, to fly faster than light. At the research station on Pluto the
   crew takes some R&R and makes needed repairs to the ship, then they
   take Vittoria back to Earth, putting her into orbit near the space
   station Asgard.

   After the crew makes more extensive repairs and upgrades the ship,
   after loading aboard more provisions and additional crew members,
   Vittoria heads back out into space and sets course for Alpha Centauri.
   When the ship arrives at that destination the crew discovers that the
   second planet of Alpha Centauri A is Earth-like. Bringing Vittoria down
   on that planet obliges Walt and Don to take one of the ship's small
   rocket shuttles down to the surface and set up a landing radar.

   As Vittoria lands on what Walt and Don have named New Terra, the two
   men see two perfectly human-looking natives also watching the ship.
   Walt makes initial contact and finds that the natives, who call
   themselves Ainsath, are friendly and eager to talk. Though
   primitive-looking, the Ainsath are highly civilized, but, where Terrans
   built their engineering expertise mostly on physics, the Ainsath have
   done so on chemistry and biology. Later the ship's doctor discovers
   that the Ainsath are not native to New Terra: as far as he can tell,
   they are biologically identical to the Terrans.

   One day Walt and Don are taken alone to the nearby Ainsath city and led
   to an old woman, who reads from a book that mimics Genesis up to the
   Tower of Babel and then deviates from it. The Ainsath are Terrans,
   displaced millennia ago.

   Vittoria returns to Terra with two of the Ainsath as passengers. After
   receiving a noisy reception at Peak City Spaceport, Walt, now Starman
   Hansman, is ready to head back out to the stars.
