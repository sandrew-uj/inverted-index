   Cover of the 1988 Bantam Spectra paperback edition. Cover art by Jim
   Burns.

   A series of brutal murders soon begins to panic the Budayeen, and
   Audran is almost executed by Friedlander Bey, who at first considers
   him to be the killer. He is then forced by the centuries-old Bey to
   become his investigator, and even worse, is made to subject himself to
   extensive, partly experimental cybernetic modifications; an advanced
   form of the brain "wiring" he has dreaded before.

   While the killer or killers step by step and very brutally begin wiping
   out witnesses as well as acquaintances of Audran, he tries to uncover
   clues to their nature and to the link between the seemingly unconnected
   victims. Meanwhile, he is fighting his fears of inadequacy in the face
   of a killer who obviously uses "moddies" making him into some of the
   most feared and bestial serial killers of history.

   Most of Audran's advances are made more by luck or intuition than
   natural skill or persistence. Yet after being accosted by (and
   subsequently overpowering) the modified killer -- who had begun
   stalking Audran himself with sadistic glee and patience -- he is not
   convinced that everything is over. In fact, he finds that one of the
   most important middlemen in the Budayeen was the real figure behind the
   murders. When he confronts him, he is almost killed himself, and facing
   death, has to insert a special "daddy" which makes him go into a
   bestial frenzy, killing the murderer. However, in his rage, he also
   slaughters a captured policeman and mutilates both bodies horribly.

   The gruesome nature of his self-defense disgusts his former
   acquaintances in the Budayeen. Friedlander Bey, in the final move
   sealing Audran's fate, then forces him into becoming one of his
   lieutenants, to serve as a new middleman between the ghetto and the
   police. As a result, he is now viewed with suspicion by everyone and
   ends the novel with practically no friends, even Yasmin turning away
   from him.
