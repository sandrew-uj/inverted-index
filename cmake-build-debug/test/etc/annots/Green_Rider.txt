   Karigan G'ladheon, a merchant's daughter, is cast out of her school in
   Selium by Dean Geyer following a duel in which she bested a wealthy
   aristocrat.

   Running away from the shame of her expulsion, she travels into the
   forest called the Green Cloak, she meets a Green Rider (a group of
   legendary and elite messengers in the king's service) who is dying with
   two black arrows protruding from his back. The Green Rider F'ryan
   Coblebay, makes Karigan swear to carry a message to Sacor City for the
   'love of her country', and there to deliver into the hands of either
   Laren, the Captain of the Green Riders, or the king himself. He also
   orders Karigan not to read the letter for the sake of her life.
   Coblebay entrusts a second more private letter to her care also. As his
   life passes, he whispers with his last breath; "beware the shadow
   man...". She also takes the gold winged horse brooch, which she only
   noticed after his death. It is the symbol of his office as a Green
   Rider.

   Karigan, following her promise, rides the horse which she calls "Horse"
   (whose real name is Condor) to Sacor City through perilous paths. The
   Horse appears to have an uncanny ability to Hate the various dangers
   Karigan encounters, always delivering Karigan to safety. During the
   journey, she meets many people, including the Berry sisters, members of
   the mystical, elf-like race of Eletians, and two traitorous Weapons (a
   special rank given only to the bodyguards of the king). Throughout her
   journey, the ghost of F'ryan Coblebay follows her, urging her on and
   providing help when desperately needed.

   When she reaches Sacor City, she is hailed as a Green Rider, and she
   delivers both letters. The second seemingly less important letter,
   which Karigan felt justified in reading as it was not addressed to the
   king, was a love letter to the beautiful Lady Estora.

   Karigan delivers the letter from F'ryan Coblebay but to everyones'
   dismay the letter appears to contain nothing of any importance. The
   Lady Estora, confused by inaccuracies in the letter delivered to her,
   approaches Karigan; who then takes the letter to Laren for closer
   inspection. The love letter is decoded to reveal a plot by his brother
   Amilton and one of the clan chiefs to kill King Zachary. Amilton, the
   elder brother of Zachary, was denied the throne due to his dishonorable
   character and eventually even lost the right to rule over the family
   province of Hillander due to his shameful behaviour.

   There follows a desperate battle as Shawdell, an Eletian who has
   infiltrated the king's court and gained the trust of the crown, is
   revealed as the Shadowman F'ryan Coblebay warned Karigan of. During a
   dangerous battle Karigan, with the help of ghosts, wounds the rogue
   Eletian and he disappears. After the battle, it is discovered that
   Amilton, Zachary's disinherited older brother, has stolen into the
   castle and taken over. An elaborate and daring plan allows Karigan,
   along with the King and his retinue, to enter the castle through the
   underground tombs. Once inside, they make their way to the throne room
   and confront Prince Amilton. Shawdell (the rogue Eletian/Shadowman) has
   merged with Amilton and is taking him over. At this point, Karigan
   almost manages to sever the connection between Amilton and Shawdell and
   is transported to an in-between place where she manages to defeat
   Shawdell/Amilton and save the kingdom. After recovering from the
   ordeal, she goes home with her father, vowing to follow in his
   footsteps and become a merchant, leaving behind service as a Green
   Rider.
