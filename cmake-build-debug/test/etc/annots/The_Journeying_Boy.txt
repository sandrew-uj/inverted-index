   leading atomic boffins, has taken to carrying a shotgun to 'shoot
   plotters and blackmailers and spies'. His new tutor, the plodding Mr
   Thewless, suggests that Humphrey might be overdoing it somewhat. But
   when a man is found shot dead at a cinema, Mr Thewless is plunged into
   a nightmare world of lies, kidnapping and murder - and grave matters of
   national security".
