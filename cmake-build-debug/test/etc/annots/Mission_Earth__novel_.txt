   The Voltars want to conquer the planet Earth as a base for their
   planned invasion of the galactic centre. The Voltars are convinced that
   Earth is about to destroy itself through pollution and possibly war,
   which would disrupt the future timetable of conquest. Fleet Combat
   Engineer Jettero Heller, a character of perfection, incorruptibility,
   and astonishing ability, is assigned to prevent the destruction of
   Earth. Reaching New York City, he investigates the problem, unaware
   that he is being tracked and that factions on Voltar want his mission
   to fail.

   Unknown to Heller, Earth is also the base of a secret operation
   conducted by the diabolically evil Lombar Hisst, Commander of the
   Apparatus, who seeks to usurp the Voltar throne. To gain control, Hisst
   has been importing illegal narcotic drugs from Earth to enslave the
   heads of government on Voltar. Hisst works to make Heller fail in his
   mission.

   Hisst assigns a stooge named Soltan Gris to supervise the mission to
   Earth, in order to sabotage it. Gris finds himself in possession of
   twelve tons of pure gold, which he tries to launder through a Swiss
   bank account and keep for himself; he becomes a prisoner of two
   man-hating lesbians who end up marrying him, but not before various
   tortures are inflicted upon him. He has terrible money and girlfriend
   troubles, and he hires a hit man who eventually targets him.

   Heller discovers a conspiracy headed by Delbert John Rockecenter, who
   keeps the population of Earth sedated with drugs and rock and roll
   music. Heller's attempts to break the demonic control of Earth by
   Rockecenter make him a target, and the corporation uses its most
   dangerous weapons to destroy him: psychiatry and psychology, and a mad,
   idealistic public relations genius by the name of J. Walter Madison.
   Madison initiates a wide-reaching public relations campaign to make
   Heller known to the world as the "Whiz Kid", but results in destroying
   Heller's reputation so that all of Heller's efforts to save the planet
   come to naught, as Madison's employer, Rockecenter, wanted. Heller's
   outstanding skills and abilities are reinforced by the arrival on Earth
   of his fiancee, the Countess Krak, and the alliance and friendship of
   the Mafia--specifically the Corleone family.

   After a series of world-shattering events, which include the impact of
   an ice meteor on the Soviet Union, the world's entire oil supply being
   turned radioactive, and a black hole orbiting the Earth, Heller returns
   to Voltar to find that not only have Hisst's plans to enslave the
   government nearly succeeded, but Madison is starting a galactic civil
   war.

   After the defeat of Hisst and Madison, a massive cover-up operation
   commences to wipe out the effects of PR, psychology and psychiatry. All
   mention of these subjects is censored and the planet Earth is
   eradicated from all star charts and similar items. As far as the
   Voltarans are concerned, planet Earth no longer exists.
