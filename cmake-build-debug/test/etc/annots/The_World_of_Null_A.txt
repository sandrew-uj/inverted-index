   Gilbert Gosseyn (pronounced go sane), a man living in an apparent
   utopia where those with superior understanding and mental control rule
   the rest of humanity, wants to be tested by the giant Machine that
   determines such superiority. However, he finds that his memories are
   false. In his search for his real identity, he discovers that he has
   extra bodies that are activated when he dies (so that, in a sense, he
   cannot be killed), that a galactic society of humans exists outside the
   Solar system, a large interstellar empire wishes to conquer both the
   Earth and Venus (inhabited by masters of non-Aristotelian logic), and
   he has extra brain matter that, when properly trained, can allow him to
   move matter with his mind.
