   Robert "Bobby" Pendragon is an everyday athletic junior high school
   student from (fictional) Stony Brook, Connecticut, located in the
   greater New York metropolitan area. Bobby's Uncle Press reveals that he
   will train Bobby to become one of the "Travelers": wormhole-journeying
   young warriors from a variety of different planets and cultures,^[5]
   who are tasked with stopping or reversing the destruction being enacted
   by the villainous Saint Dane. Saint Dane is a shapeshifting demon whose
   favorite form is a tall human with icy blue eyes and long grey hair,
   but who can variously transform into a raven, a cloud of smoke, and a
   variety of other forms. He plans to destroy "what separates order from
   chaos"--the very fabric and structure of the universe, known as
   "Halla"^[6]--so that he can rebuild it according to his own twisted
   design. Uncle Press, the lead Traveler, introduces Bobby to the
   "flumes": enchanted tubes used by Travelers to journey among the ten
   "territories", which are especially eventful locations and time-periods
   in the universe. Press explains that Bobby is a resident and designated
   Traveler of the territory known as "Second Earth", which means planet
   Earth (especially centering on New York City) during the early 2000s
   (the present moment at the time of the series' publication).

   Most of the novels in the series are structured around a similar basic
   conflict: as one of Halla's ten territories reaches a crucial turning
   point, in which its people must make a critical global decision for
   their future, Saint Dane arrives, hoping to lead the people towards
   self-destruction, especially through cultural homogenization, social
   inequality, discrimination, and totalitarianism.^[7] Bobby must then
   travel to each threatened territory to thwart Saint Dane's plans,
   sending journals back home (to Second Earth) to be received and kept
   safe by his best friends, Mark Dimond and Courtney Chetwynde, who
   become sometimes involved with the action and are deemed Bobby's
   "acolytes": personal helpers and record-keepers along Bobby's journey.
   There is one Traveler from each territory, and Bobby cooperates with
   all ten along his journey. Throughout the series, Saint Dane often
   confronts Bobby personally and asks him to join his side, but Bobby
   consistently refuses.

   Bobby soon realizes his central role in the battle for Halla: that he
   is to replace his uncle as the lead Traveler, pursuing Saint Dane and
   helping to guide the territories back toward stability with the
   assistance of the other Travelers, their acolytes, and further allies.
   The turning points of the ten territories, in order, occur on: the
   medieval wilds of Denduron; the ocean-wide planet of Cloral; First
   Earth (the approximate time and location of the 1937 Hindenburg
   disaster); the virtual-reality wastelands of Veelox; the rainforests of
   Eelong; the deserts of Zadaa; the corporate monopoly-controlled arenas
   of Quillan; the semi-civilized island of Ibara (located on the planet
   Veelox, though 300 years after the "Veelox" territory); Second Earth;
   and, lastly, Third Earth (New York City in the year 5010).^[8]

   Along his journeys, Bobby also learns martial arts, sometimes even
   dueling with Saint Dane one-on-one. Bobby also comes to respect the
   diverse peoples of Halla, who wildly differ in their social structures,
   technologies, philosophies, traditions, and other cultural aspects. He
   also has to adapt to each territory's environment in order to be ready
   to confront Saint Dane at a moment's notice. Bobby gradually learns the
   nature of what it really means to be a Traveler, first hinted at when
   Saint Dane mysteriously begins referring to the Travelers as
   "illusions". Saint Dane's long-term strategy also eventually surfaces,
   centering on a mysterious event called "the Convergence", in which the
   territories' turning points all begin to coincide, potentially causing
   an escalating chain reaction of chaos throughout Halla.^[9] Matters
   worsen when the Traveler from Quillan, named Nevva Winter,
   treacherously defects to Saint Dane's side. Meanwhile, the Convergence
   causes some territories to undergo a devastating and unanticipated
   second turning point.

   By the ninth book, Bobby and his friends have successfully prevented
   the destruction of five territories, but they have failed in their
   fight against Saint Dane on Second Earth, Veelox, Ibara, and Quillan.
   Even worse, by overrunning Second Earth, Saint Dane manages to reverse
   all previous Traveler victories, allowing him to establish an elitist
   and genocidal cult called Ravinia. Ravinia openly marches its robot
   army of humanoid soldiers, "dados", throughout the territories, freely
   breaking down the boundaries between the territories. In the tenth and
   final book, Bobby finally learns about the true nature of Travelers:
   that he and the others are not actually humans at all, but rather,
   human-shaped guardian spirits created by something called Solara: the
   accumulated energy of all positive sentient knowledge and creativity.
   Contrarily, Saint Dane is a spirit arisen from a dark antithesis of
   Solara. Reuniting one last time, Bobby and the Travelers confront Saint
   Dane in a final battle on Third Earth in order to begin Halla's process
   toward recovery at last.^[10]
