   In year 2048, global warming has caused much of the surface of the
   earth to become flooded. In the city of New Vatican, Cardinal Battaglia
   believes that the global inundation can be gotten rid of by using the
   "scepter of Moses". This is the staff that Moses used to part the Red
   Sea during The Exodus.

   Cardinal Battaglia contacts John Kubiak (James Brolin) and his sons
   Jack (Ian Somerhalder) and Thomas (Jamie King). The Kubiak family is
   raiding the sunken New York City for various treasures lost beneath the
   waves. The Kubiaks are to assist Brother Fontana and Father Giacopetti
   in a submarine to retrieve the scepter and save the earth. They are
   opposed by Nicholas Filiminov (Ben Cross), a major land dealer who
   wants the scepter for his own purposes; having forced the water to rise
   to cover the remaining land, survivors will be forced to live in his
   planned floating communities, and he can then purchase the sunken land
   for a pittance before lowering the water level again. The Kubiak
   brothers are also involved with two women, Giovanna (Bettina
   Zimmermann)--Jack's ex--and Cara (Elodie Frenck)--their new mechanic,
   who take on a new importance after John's death forces his sons to take
   up his mission. Despite the attempted intervention of an insane
   Cardinal who sees the Rising as God's punishment for mankind's sins,
   the new Team Kubiak are able to activate an ancient chamber that
   triggers the lowering of the flood waters. The film ends with the team
   having dinner and contemplating their future as they visit the
   thirty-one other chambers listed on the map as activating that one
   chamber only caused the Mediterranean to drop ten meters while not
   affecting the rest of the world.
