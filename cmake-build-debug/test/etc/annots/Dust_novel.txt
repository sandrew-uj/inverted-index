   The plot opens with Kay Scarpetta receiving a phone call from Marino
   informing her about a body, later identified as Gail Shipton, recovered
   in a field adjoining Massachusetts Information Technology (MIT) campus.
   As detailed by witnesses, the body was found wrapped in an unusual
   white cloth, a picture of which brings back to memory a similar scene
   from 'Capital murders'- a case of triple killings in the capital city
   Washington- something that Benton had shared with her (albeit without
   FBI authorization) in lieu of her expertise. Haley Swansen, the
   boyfriend of the deceased is interrogated and it is revealed that he is
   transgender. The Capital murders were temporally separated, the first
   in April and the last two around Thanksgiving, each body clad only in
   panties belonging to the prior victim and posed in an open field
   stone's throw away from a rail track. Ed Granby, Benton's boss and head
   of Boston division, had refused to release key information pertaining
   to these cases under the pretext 'to avoid replication of this
   murder-style'.

   It is learned that the deceased had filed a $100million lawsuit against
   her financial advisor : `Double-S''', a firm with 6 other lawsuits -
   none of which reached the court since referred to as `frivolous' by CEO
   Dominic Lombardi - and under probation from SEC (Securities and
   Exchange Commission) for irregularities.

   Gail Shipton's body, upon close inspection by Kay Scarpetta, was found
   to be wrapped in a white cloth made up of a low-stretch synthetic
   fabric, with conspicuous absence of injury marks (not even those
   incurred from defending oneself) except for pinpoint conjunctival
   hemorrhages, covered in fluorescent glitter and characteristically clad
   only in an ill-fitting panty. Benton claims that this scenario bears
   striking resemblance to the Capital Murders and theorizes that the
   killer is audacious, learned from a fact that he purposefully left the
   tool-box containing the cutter (to gain entry through the locked
   field-gate) close to the crime scene.

   Benton confides in Kay that a person named Martin Lagos, possibly dead,
   has been announced as being responsible for the triple murders. The
   accused's DNA had matched the blood sample from the 3rd victim's
   panties which Kay herself had previously confirmed to be menstrual
   specimen that had matched to the 2nd victim. Going by logic that the
   killer dresses each subsequent victim in his prior victim's panty, Kay
   begins to think that the DNA sample could have been tampered to frame
   the accused on purpose.

   In a twist of events, the CFC is rocked by the news of 3 additional
   murders which have occurred in the Double-S firm. Haley Swanson, Gail
   Shipton's boyfriend, is said to have been seen escaping the premises,
   identified not by his face but by the same hoodie that he was wearing
   (while previously being interrogated in light of Gail Shipton's
   murder.) Upon reaching the latest crime scene the 3 bodies are
   identified as belonging to Dominic Lombardi, his secretary and the 3rd,
   to everyone's surprise, Haley Swanson himself! The person who absconded
   with his hoodie who also happens to be the serial killer is still at
   large at that moment.

   Detailed search about the reason why Martin Lagos was framed leads them
   to Daniel Mrse, Martin's friend. Martin' s mom who worked as a curator
   at the white house was found dead in her bath-tub (in 1996), a definite
   murder scene made to look like an accidental death. But with evidence
   strongly pointing towards Daniel Mrse, Kay through phone records,
   realizes that Dr Geist had a phonic conversation with Ed Granby prior
   to the body being discovered, prompting her to doubt the intent of the
   phone call.

   Now, certain of Ed Granby's involvement, an hacked email reveals that
   money has exchanged hands to conceal & falsify the identify of the
   killer. The killer himself is later identified as Daniel Mrse - the
   biological son of Dominic Lombardi and thus explains the father's
   repeated attempts to cover up the murders.

   Daniel Mrse is tracked down to Florida, working in a circus. A raid of
   his vanity car reveals the presence of face masks made of clay,
   representing each of the women that he had murdered and also providing
   the reason for the fluorescent glitter. Further, the temporal gap in
   the murders coincides with the circus traveling to Cambridge and
   Washington.
