   The Third Policeman is set in rural Ireland and is narrated by a
   dedicated amateur scholar of de Selby, a scientist and philosopher.^[3]
   The narrator, whose name we never learn, is orphaned at a young
   age.^[4] At boarding school, he discovers the work of de Selby and
   becomes a fanatically dedicated student of it. One night he breaks his
   leg under mysterious circumstances - "if you like, it was broken for
   me" - and he is ultimately fitted with a wooden leg to replace the
   original one.^[5] On returning to his family home, he meets and
   befriends John Divney who is in charge of the family farm and pub. Over
   the next few years, the narrator devotes himself to the study of de
   Selby's work and leaves Divney to run the family business.

   By the time the narrator is thirty, he has written what he believes to
   be the definitive critical work on de Selby, but does not have enough
   money to have it published. Divney observes that Mathers, a local man,
   "is worth a packet of potato-meal" and eventually it dawns on the
   narrator that Divney plans to rob and kill Mathers.^[6] The narrator
   and Divney encounter Mathers one night on the road and Divney knocks
   Mathers down with a bicycle pump. The narrator, prompted by Divney,
   finishes Mathers off with a spade, and then notices that Divney has
   disappeared with Mathers's cash box. When Divney returns, he refuses to
   reveal the location of the cash box and fends off the narrator's
   repeated inquiries.^[7] To ensure that Divney does not retrieve the box
   unobserved, the narrator becomes more and more inseparable from Divney,
   eventually sharing a bed with him: "the situation was a queer one and
   neither of us liked it".^[8]

   Three years pass, in which the previously amicable relationship between
   the narrator and Divney breaks down. Eventually Divney reveals that the
   box is hidden under the floorboards in Mathers's old house, and
   instructs the narrator to fetch it. The narrator follows Divney's
   instructions but just as he reaches for the box, "something happened":

     It was as if the daylight had changed with unnatural suddenness, as
     if the temperature of the evening had altered greatly in an instant
     or as if the air had become twice as rare or twice as dense as it
     had been in the winking of an eye; perhaps all of these and other
     things happened together for all my senses were bewildered all at
     once and could give me no explanation.^[9]

   The box has disappeared, and the narrator is perplexed to notice that
   Mathers is in the room with him. During a surreal conversation with the
   apparently dead Mathers, the narrator hears another voice speaking to
   him which he realises is his soul: "For convenience I called him
   Joe."^[10] The narrator is bent on finding the cash box, and when
   Mathers tells him about a remarkable police barracks nearby he resolves
   to go to the barracks and enlist the help of the police in finding the
   box.^[11] On the way, he meets a one-legged bandit named Martin
   Finnucane, who threatens to kill him but who becomes his friend upon
   finding out that his potential victim is also one-legged.^[12] The
   narrator approaches the police barracks and is disturbed by its
   appearance:

     It looked as if it were painted like an advertisement on a board on
     the roadside and indeed very poorly painted. It looked completely
     false and unconvincing.^[13]

   Inside the barracks he meets two of the three policemen, Sergeant Pluck
   and Policeman MacCruiskeen, who speak largely in non-sequitur and who
   are entirely obsessed with bicycles.^[14] There he is introduced to
   various peculiar or irrational concepts, artefacts, and locations,
   including a contraption that collects sound and converts it to light
   based on a theory regarding omnium, the fundamental energy of the
   universe; a vast underground chamber called 'Eternity,' where time
   stands still, mysterious numbers are devoutly recorded and worried
   about by the policemen; a box from which anything you desire can be
   produced; and an intricate carved chest containing a series of
   identical but smaller chests. The infinite nature of this last device
   causes the narrator great mental and spiritual discomfort.^[15] It is
   later discovered that Mathers has been found dead and eviscerated in a
   ditch.^[16] Joe suspects Martin Finnucane, but to the narrator's dismay
   he himself is charged with the crime because he is the most convenient
   suspect.^[17] He argues with Sergeant Pluck that since he is nameless,
   and therefore, as Pluck observed, "invisible to the law", he cannot be
   charged with anything. Pluck is surprised, but after he unsuccessfully
   attempts to guess the narrator's name he reasons that since the
   narrator is nameless he is not really a person, and can therefore be
   hanged without fear of repercussions:

     The particular death you die is not even a death (which is an
     inferior phenomenon at best) only an insanitary abstraction in the
     backyard[...].^[18]

   The narrator calls on the help of Finnucane, but his rescue is thwarted
   by MacCruiskeen riding a bicycle painted an unknown colour which drives
   those who see it mad. He faces the gallows, but the two policemen are
   called away by dangerously high readings in the underground
   chamber.^[19] The following day he escapes from the barracks on a
   bicycle of unusual perfection.^[20]

   As he rides through the countryside, he passes Mathers's house and sees
   a light.^[21] Disturbed, he enters the house and finally meets the
   mysterious and reportedly all-powerful third policeman, Fox, who has
   the face of Mathers.^[22] Fox's secret police station is in the walls
   of Mathers's house. He tells the narrator that he is the architect of
   the readings in the underground chamber, which he alters for his
   amusement, thereby inadvertently saving the narrator's life.^[23] Fox
   goes on to tell the narrator that he found the cash box and has sent it
   to the narrator's home, where it is waiting for him. He also reveals
   that the box contains not money but omnium, which can become anything
   he desires.^[23] Elated by the possibilities before him, the narrator
   leaves Fox's police station and goes home looking forward to seeing
   Divney once again; on arrival he finds that while only a few days have
   passed in his own life, his accomplice is sixteen years older, with a
   wife and children.^[24] Divney can see the narrator, although the
   others cannot, and he has a heart attack from the shock. He shouts that
   the narrator was supposed to be dead, for the black box was not filled
   with money but a bomb and it exploded when the narrator reached for it.
   The narrator leaves Divney on the floor, apparently dying.^[25]

   Feeling "sad, empty and without a thought", the narrator leaves the
   house and walks away down the road.^[26] He soon approaches the police
   barracks, the book using exactly the same words to describe the
   barracks and the narrator's opinion of it that were used earlier, the
   story having circled around itself and restarted.^[27] This time, John
   Divney joins the narrator on the road; they neither look at nor speak
   to each other. They both enter the police station and are confronted by
   Sergeant Pluck, who repeats his earlier dialogue and ends the book with
   a reprise of his original greeting to the narrator:

     "Is it about a bicycle?" he asked.^[28]
