   The novel takes the form of a tragic epic, following the protagonist,
   Prince Evnos of Iankoros, from his youth to old age. His early life is
   typical for an aristocrat of his class; he is educated to his role in
   life, married, and sent to war.

   Losing his wife in childbirth, the prince studies magic and heroically
   undertakes a descent into the underworld to reclaim her from the god of
   death. He finds it a strange and terrible place, and the afterlife a
   thing of unremitting horror, with every human being condemned to
   everlasting torment regardless of their conduct in life.

   Maddened and embittered by the failure of his quest, Evnos retires to a
   rocky island with his daughter to eke out his declining years.
