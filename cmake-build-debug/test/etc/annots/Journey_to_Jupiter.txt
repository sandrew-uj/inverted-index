   The first manned expedition to Jupiter reaches speeds never experienced
   before; despite this it takes several months to reach its objective,
   leading to tensions among the crew, as well as serious vision problems
   caused by "light slip". A miscalculation in the gravity of Jupiter
   means that they will not be able to stop in time and will crash into
   the giant planet. A diversion to the jagged Io offers their only chance
   of survival.
