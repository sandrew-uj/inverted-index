   The story takes place in 1959 in Memphis. "Little Man" Victor, an
   eleven-year-old boy who stutters, takes over his best friend Rat's
   paper route while Rat is visiting his grandparents. Little Man has
   various encounters with Rat's customers. The paper route poses
   challenges and introduces Little Man to life's daily obstacles.

   He has a run-in with the neighborhood junk man, Ara T, a bully and
   thief who Little Man was warned to stay away from by his Mam. Ara puts
   the boy's life, as well as Mam's, in danger. Victor begins to wonder
   what it means to have a soul. He thinks about his talks with Mr. Spiro,
   a merchant sailor who has settled into the area; who he met on his
   paper route. He sees Mrs. Worthington walking hand in hand with her
   husband and hopes she's happy. He befriends a boy on the route who he
   has learned is deaf, and he is finally able to tell his mother that the
   food she thinks is his favorite is not. Though he has recently
   discovered that his dad is not his birth father, he embraces their
   loving relationship and strives to deepen it. Mr. Spiro, he learns, is
   going to leave soon on one of his merchant ships, and he gives Little
   Man a cut up dollar bill with 4 words on it. By the end of the book, he
   is even able to speak several full sentences in front of his class,
   finally verbalizing his own name for the first time. Victor tells Mam
   he's learned that what he says is more important than how he says it
   and that his soul doesn't stutter. In the end, it turns out that Victor
   had typed up the entire book.
