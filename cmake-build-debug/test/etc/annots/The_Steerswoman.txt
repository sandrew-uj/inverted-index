   Steerswoman Rowan is investigating the origins of a number of beautiful
   blue crystals that have been found in random locations throughout the
   land. During her investigation, she meets Bel, an outspoken Outskirter
   (those who live on the outskirts of civilization). Rowan is later
   attacked on the road and Bel comes to her rescue. The two women agree
   to travel together. Bel agrees to not use any knowledge she gleans from
   Rowan's help to allow her tribe to attack the outlying villages, which
   Outskirters do on occasion when their goats cannot sustain them.

   The pair make their way back to Rowan's Steerswoman Archives. Rowan's
   fellow Steerswomen agree that she should continue her investigation,
   but in a different manner than before, as her current investigations
   are drawing notice and attempts on her life (the man from the inn, the
   dragons), and they suggest she go undercover.

   The story switches perspective to a young runaway named Will, who has a
   talent for making things explode, much in the way wizards do sometimes.
   He joins a caravan headed away from his home. Two of his traveling
   companions are Rowan and Bel, traveling in disguise. Will becomes
   attached to Bel and although the pair try to get rid of him as they
   leave the caravan to continue their investigation, he follows along to
   help out.

   Bel and Rowan come to the town they intend to investigate as a rumored
   source of the stones and find a shopkeeper who claims to design and
   sell the stones himself. With Will's help, the pair discover this to be
   a false trail left for them, and quickly leave town, pretending to
   believe the story. They are stalked by a group of soldiers who have
   orders to capture them and bring them to a pair of wizards, Dhree and
   Shammer, a brother and sister who Rowan eventually learns are under the
   control of a wizard named Slado. She and Bel slip into the stronghold
   of the wizards disguised as guards and then Rowan is captured.

   Rowan is surprised to discover that Dhree and Shammer are barely
   teenagers, and probably too young to actually be in control. She is
   able to converse with them by giving them information freely and not
   asking them any questions that they would refuse to answer, thereby
   earning them the ban. The siblings talk amongst themselves in her
   presence and she gleans valuable information from them for a time
   before they shut her up in a room to wait for Slado to arrive and take
   her. Bel and Will spring her from her prison through the distraction of
   Will's exploding magic.

   Back at the Archives, the Steerswomen put together the clues they have
   gathered and conclude that the blue stones are pieces of a fallen
   guidestar, brought down for some unknown reason by the wizards, who may
   have put them up there in the first place. Rowan plays the same
   information game she did with Dhree and Shammer with another wizard who
   is not loyal to Slado. She convinces him to take Will on as an
   apprentice. Will promises to share information about wizard magic with
   the Steerswomen.
