   Villette begins with its famously passive protagonist, Lucy Snowe, age
   14, staying at the home of her godmother Mrs. Bretton in "the clean and
   ancient town of Bretton", in England. Also in residence are Mrs.
   Bretton's teenaged son, John Graham Bretton (whom the family calls
   Graham), and a young visitor, Paulina Home (who is called Polly). Polly
   is a serious little girl who soon develops a deep devotion to Graham,
   who showers her with attention. But Polly's visit is cut short when her
   father arrives to summon her to live with him abroad.

   For reasons that are not stated, Lucy leaves Mrs. Bretton's home a few
   weeks after Polly's departure. Some years pass, during which an
   unspecified family tragedy leaves Lucy without family, home, or means.
   After some initial hesitation, she is hired as a caregiver by Miss
   Marchmont, a rheumatic crippled woman. Lucy is soon accustomed to her
   work and has begun to feel content with her quiet, frugal lifestyle.

   The night of a dramatic storm, Miss Marchmont regains all her energy
   and feels young again. She shares with Lucy her sad love story of 30
   years ago, and concludes that she should treat Lucy better and be a
   better person. She believes that death will reunite her with her dead
   lover. The next morning, Lucy finds Miss Marchmont died in the night.

   Lucy then leaves the English countryside and goes to London. At the age
   of 23, she boards a ship for Labassecour (Belgium) despite knowing very
   little French. She travels to the city of Villette, where she finds
   employment as a bonne (nanny) at Mme. Beck's boarding school for girls.
   (This school is seen as being based upon the Hegers' Brussels
   pensionnat). After a time, she is hired to teach English at the school,
   in addition to having to mind Mme. Beck's three children. She thrives
   despite Mme. Beck's constant surveillance of the staff and students.

   "Dr. John," a handsome English doctor, frequently visits the school at
   the behest of Mme Beck, and deepens his love for the coquette Ginevra
   Fanshawe. In one of Villette's famous plot twists, "Dr. John" is later
   revealed to be John Graham Bretton, a fact that Lucy has known since he
   asked her why she was staring at him once, but has deliberately
   concealed from the reader. Graham recognises Lucy only after she is
   brought to Mrs. Bretton's new home after collapsing from fever and
   mental exhaustion during the Christmas break. After Dr. John (i.e.,
   Graham) discovers Ginevra's classless character while at the theatre,
   he turns his attention to Lucy, and they become close friends. She
   values this friendship highly despite her usual emotional reserve.

   Lucy and Graham meet Polly (Paulina Home) again at the same theater;
   her father has inherited the title "de Bassompierre" and is now a
   Count. Thus her name is now Paulina Home de Bassompierre. Polly and
   Graham soon discover that they knew each other in the past and slowly
   renew their friendship. They fall in love and eventually marry.

   Lucy becomes progressively closer to a colleague, the irascible,
   autocratic, and confrontational professor, M. Paul Emanuel, a relative
   of Mme. Beck. Lucy gradually realises that his apparent antagonism is
   actually helping her to overcome her weaknesses and to grow. She and
   Paul eventually fall in love.

   However, a group of conspiring antagonists, including Mme. Beck, the
   priest Pere Silas, and the relatives of M. Paul's long-dead fiancee,
   work to keep the two apart, on the grounds that a union between a
   Catholic and a Protestant is impossible. They finally succeed in
   forcing M. Paul's departure for the West Indies to oversee a plantation
   there. He nonetheless declares his love for Lucy before his departure
   and arranges for her to live independently as the headmistress of her
   own day school, which she later expands into a pensionnat (boarding
   school).

   During the course of the novel, Lucy has three encounters with the
   figure of a nun -- which may be the ghost of a nun who was buried alive
   on the school's grounds as punishment for breaking her vow of chastity.
   In a highly symbolic scene near the end of the novel, she discovers the
   "nun's" habit in her bed and destroys it. She later finds out that it
   was a disguise worn by Ginevra's amour, Alfred de Hamal, placed in
   Lucy's bed as a prank. The episodes with the nun no doubt contributed
   substantially to the novel's reputation as a gothic novel. Ginevra
   keeps in contact with Lucy through letters that show the young coquette
   has not changed and expects to live off of her uncle's (Basompierre's)
   good graces.

   Villette's final pages are ambiguous. Although Lucy says that she wants
   to leave the reader free to imagine a happy ending, she hints strongly
   that M. Paul's ship was destroyed by a storm during his return journey
   from the West Indies. She says that, "M. Emanuel was away three years.
   Reader, they were the three happiest years of my life." This passage
   suggests that he was drowned by the "destroying angel of tempest."

   Bronte described the ambiguity of the ending as a "little puzzle"
   (quoted in Chapter XII of part 2 of Gaskell's Life).
