   The book features a mad scientist, De Selby, who tries to destroy the
   world by removing all the oxygen from the air. He has also many strange
   inventions. He exploits the theory of relativity and invents a kind of
   time travelling machine, which he uses to age his whiskey, creating
   brews that have been aged for many decades in just a few hours.

   Saint Augustine and James Joyce both have speaking parts in the novel.
   James Joyce, after forging his own obituary to escape being drafted to
   fight in the Second World War, was serving pints in a small pub. Saint
   Augustine, on the other hand, appeared in a magical underwater cave and
   held a conversation with De Selby. The mad scientist De Selby leads the
   two main characters, Hackett and Mick, to the cave, to witness this
   conversation.

   Many prominent elements of the book, particularly De Selby himself, the
   eccentric policemen, and the atomic theory of the bicycle, were taken
   from O'Brien's much earlier novel The Third Policeman, because he had
   not been able to find a publisher for it. The latter novel was
   published posthumously.
