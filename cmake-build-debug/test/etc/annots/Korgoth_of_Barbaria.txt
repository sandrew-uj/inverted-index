   From the Adult Swim website:

     In a dark future wasteland, the great cities have risen and fallen,
     primordial beasts have reclaimed the wilderness and thieves and
     savages populate sparse, dirty towns. From the frozen north emerges
     a warrior known as Korgoth, and his merciless savagery may be his
     only key to survival.

   Korgoth of Barbaria followed the exploits of the eponymous Korgoth
   (voiced by actor Diedrich Bader), and parodied Conan the Barbarian,
   as well as the sword and sorcery subgenre in general. The show was set
   in a post-apocalyptic world where sorcery and the remnants of
   technology exist simultaneously. The heavy metal/thrash metal musical
   theme was composed by Lee Holdridge.
