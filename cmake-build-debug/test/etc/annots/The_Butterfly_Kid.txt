   The novel is primarily set in Greenwich Village, and is thoroughly
   saturated with psychedelic and 1960s counterculture elements. The time
   is an undefined near future, indicated by SF elements such as video
   phones and personal hovercraft; the Bicentennial is also mentioned. The
   use of psychoactive drugs and their effects are a central element of
   the story; much of the action revolves around an alien-introduced drug
   (referred to as "Reality Pills") that cause LSD-like hallucinations to
   manifest physically, generally causing chaos. The book's protagonist
   shares a name with the author, and another character shares the name of
   Michael Kurland, a friend and roommate of the author's at that
   time.^[2]

   The book's title refers to a character, Sean, who is able to
   spontaneously produce butterflies of all shapes, sizes, and colors
   after taking a "Reality Pill." Although Sean is introduced very early
   in the story, he is not the novel's central character.^[2]
