   Osberne Wulfgrimsson and Elfhild are lovers who live on opposite sides
   of the Sundering Flood, an immense river. When Elfhild disappears
   during an invasion by the Red Skinners, the heartbroken Osberne takes
   up his magical sword Boardcleaver and joins the army of Sir Godrick of
   Longshaw, in whose service he helps dethrone the tyrannical king and
   plutocracy of merchants ruling the city at the mouth of the river.
   Afterwards he locates Elfhild, who had fled with a relative, a wise
   woman skilled in the magical arts, and taken refuge in the Wood
   Masterless. Elfhild tells Osberne of their adventures en route to
   safety. Afterwards they return together to Wethrmel, Osberne's home,
   and all ends happily.
