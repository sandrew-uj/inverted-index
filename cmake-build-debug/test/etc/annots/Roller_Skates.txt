   Roller Skates opens with the narrator remembering back to a special
   year in the 1890s, when young Lucinda Wyman arrives at the Misses
   Peters' home in New York City; the two ladies will care for her during
   the year of Lucinda's parents' trip to Italy. The narrator's diaries
   help her remember the details of 10-year-old Lucinda's "orphanage," as
   she calls it. Miss Peters, a teacher, is "a person of great
   understanding, no nonsense, and no interference." Miss Nettie is
   shy and soft-hearted. Living with them Lucinda experiences
   unprecedented freedom, exploring the city on roller skates and making
   friends with all types of people.

   Lucinda quickly gets to know Mr. Gilligan the hansom cab driver and
   Patrolman M'Gonegal. The first friend of her own age is Tony Coppino,
   son of an Italian fruit stand owner. Lucinda enlists Officer M'Gonegal
   to stop the bullies who knock down Tony's father's fruit-stand and
   steal the fruit. In return Tony takes her for a city picnic where they
   meet a rag-and-bone man. Later Lucinda reads Shakespeare with her
   favorite uncle and is inspired to put on a puppet production of The
   Tempest.

   But the cold and snow of winter keep her cooped up indoors, and
   eventually a restless Lucinda acts out and gets sent home from school
   in disgrace. Later her uncle introduces her to Shakespeare's tragedies,
   and she experiences her own when two of her friends die. With Lucinda's
   parents coming back from Italy, she realizes everything is changing, so
   she skates to the park one last time. "How would you like to stay
   always ten?" she muses. "That's what I'd call a perfectly elegant
   idea!"
