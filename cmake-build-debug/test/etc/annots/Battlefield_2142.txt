   In the year 2106, a new ice age began. As the ice expanded, millions of
   people all over the world were displaced, particularly in Russia and
   Japan. Combined with their increasing inability to find sufficient
   natural resources, the Pan Asian Coalition grows desperate. Meanwhile,
   the European Union is able to withstand the displacements and find
   sufficient resources, mostly from North Africa due to their
   relationship with the Union of African States (Africa remaining mostly
   ice-free). Seeing this, the PAC launches a full-scale invasion of
   Europe and North Africa in 2139, beginning the Cold War of the 22nd
   century, a war for the world's last remaining land and resources.

   The Final Stand multiplayer expansion pack for Battlefield 4 gives new
   insight about the cold war, revealing that the PAC was formed as early
   as 2020 (the year Battlefield 4 takes place) as early versions of the
   coalition's symbol can be seen. Furthermore, early prototypes of Titans
   and other vehicles and futuristic technology were already in
   development in 2020 by the PAC in remote regions of Russia.
