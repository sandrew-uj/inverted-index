   The action takes place in an imagined future a few years after the time
   of writing. Tension between the US and the Soviet Union remains high.
   Both nations have landed on the Moon, and established bases there.

   Just under half the length of the novel tells how a discovery on the
   Moon brings Massachusetts linguist, Robert Fairlie to a high-security
   space base in New Mexico and eventually to the planet Ryn. The
   remainder of the novel is about what happens on Ryn after Fairlie and
   his companions arrive: their contact with some of the inhabitants of
   the planet, and later with Ryn's ancient enemy, the "shadowed ones".
