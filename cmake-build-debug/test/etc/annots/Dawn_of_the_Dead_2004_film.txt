   After finishing a long shift as a nurse at the Milwaukee County
   Hospital, Ana returns to her suburban neighborhood and her husband
   Louis. Caught up in a date night, they miss an emergency news bulletin.
   The next morning, a girl from the neighborhood enters and kills Louis,
   who immediately reanimates as a zombie and attacks Ana. She flees in
   her car, crashes, and passes out. Upon waking, she joins police
   sergeant Kenneth Rhodes, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal
   Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda. They break into a nearby mall and
   are attacked by a zombie security guard, who slightly bites Luda. Three
   guards -- C.J., Bart, and Terry -- make them surrender their weapons in
   exchange for refuge. They split into groups to secure the mall. On the
   roof, they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded in his gun store
   across the zombie-infested parking lot. A broadcast from a television
   features a group of cops burning the corpses of zombies and instructs
   the viewers to shoot zombies in the head to kill them quickly,
   prompting the survivors to heed this advice.

   The next day, a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot,
   pursued by zombies. They include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen,
   Frank and his daughter, Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she
   is wheeled inside, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the
   group determines the disease is passed by bites. Luda keeps her bite a
   secret from the group, though Andre knows. Frank, who has been bitten,
   elects to be isolated. When he reanimates, Kenneth shoots him.

   Kenneth and Andy start a friendship by way of messages written on a
   whiteboard; romance buds between Ana and Michael, as well as Nicole and
   Terry. When the power goes out, a few of the survivors go to the
   parking garage to activate the emergency generator and find a friendly
   dog who is adopted by Nicole and named Chips. Zombies kill Bart,
   forcing the others to douse the zombies in gas and set them ablaze.
   Meanwhile, Luda -- tied up by Andre -- dies before giving birth. She
   reanimates and Norma kills her. This makes Andre snap; he exchanges
   gunfire with Norma and the two kill each other. The others find a
   zombie baby in Andre's arms delivered after Luda's death, which they
   kill reluctantly. The group decides to fight their way to the marina
   and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They
   reinforce two shuttle buses from the garage; welding on a snowplow,
   attaching metal bars and chains as well as stocking chainsaws, propane
   tanks and road flares.

   To rescue Andy, the group straps supplies onto Chips and lower him into
   the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters
   Andy's store safely, but a zombie follows and bites Andy. Pursuing
   Chips, Nicole crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she
   is trapped by a zombified Andy. A group of them reach the gun store via
   the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go
   back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and C.J.
   shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door
   because Steve temporarily abandoned his guard duty. Zombies storm the
   mall, forcing an evacuation via the buses.

   While navigating the city, Glen loses control of a chainsaw,
   accidentally killing Monica. In the chaos, their bus crashes, killing
   Glen. Steve tries to flee on his own but is ambushed by a zombie. Ana
   kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. At the marina,
   C.J. sacrifices himself by detonating a propane tank so the others can
   escape. Michael, after revealing a bite wound, kills himself as Ana,
   Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips flee on the yacht.

   Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows the group run out of
   supplies, arrive at an island and get attacked by a swarm of zombies.
   The camcorder drops, leaving their fate unknown.
