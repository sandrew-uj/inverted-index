   The Giver is a 1993 American young adult dystopian novel written by
   Lois Lowry. It is set in a society which at first appears to be utopian
   but is revealed to be dystopian as the story progresses. The novel
   follows a 12-year-old boy named Jonas. The society has taken away pain
   and strife by converting to "Sameness", a plan that has also eradicated
   emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the
   position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the past
   memories of the time before Sameness, as there may be times where one
   must draw upon the wisdom gained from history to aid the community's
   decision making. Jonas struggles with concepts of all the new emotions
   and things introduced to him: whether they are inherently good, evil,
   or in between, and whether it is even possible to have one without the
   other. The Community lacks any color, memory, climate, or terrain, all
   in an effort to preserve structure, order, and a true sense of equality
   beyond personal individuality.^[1]

   The Giver won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has sold more than 12 million
   copies worldwide as of 2018.^[2] In Australia, Canada, and the United
   States, it is on many middle school reading lists,^[3]^[4] but it is
   also frequently challenged and it ranked number 11 on the American
   Library Association list of the most challenged books of the 1990s.^[5]
   A 2012 survey based in the U.S. designated it the fourth-best
   children's novel of all time.^[6]

   In 2014, a film adaptation was released, starring Jeff Bridges, Meryl
   Streep and Brenton Thwaites.^[7] The novel forms a loose quartet^[8]
   with three other books set in the same future era, known as The Giver
   Quartet: Gathering Blue (2000), Messenger (2004), and Son (2012).
