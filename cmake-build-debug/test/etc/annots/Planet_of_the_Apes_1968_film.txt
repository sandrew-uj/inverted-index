   Teaser, Planet of the Apes (1968)

   Astronauts Taylor, Landon, and Dodge awaken from deep hibernation after
   a near-light-speed space voyage. Stewart, the lone female crew member,
   is dead due to a sleep chamber malfunction. Their spacecraft crashes
   into a lake on an unknown planet and the men abandon the sinking
   vessel. Before bailing out, Taylor reads the ship's chronometer as
   November 25, 3978, two thousand and six years after their departure in
   1972.

   The men travel through desolate wasteland, coming across eerie
   scarecrow-like figures and a freshwater lake with lush vegetation.
   While swimming, the men's clothes are stolen and shredded by primitive
   mute humans. Soon after, armed gorillas raid a cornfield where the
   humans are gathering food. Taylor is shot in the throat as he and the
   others are captured. Dodge is killed and Landon rendered unconscious in
   the chaos. Taylor is taken to Ape City. Two chimpanzees, animal
   psychologist Zira and surgeon Galen, save Taylor's life, though his
   throat injury renders him temporarily mute.

   Taylor is placed with a captive female, whom he later names Nova. He
   observes an advanced society of talking apes with a strict caste
   system: gorillas are the military force and laborers; orangutans
   oversee government and religion; and intellectual chimpanzees are
   mostly scientists and doctors. The ape society is a theocracy, while
   the apes consider the primitive humans as vermin to be hunted and
   either killed outright, enslaved, or used in scientific experiments.
   Taylor convinces Zira and her fiance, Cornelius, that he is intelligent
   as they are; one way by making a paper airplane. Dr. Zaius, their
   orangutan superior, arranges for Taylor to be castrated against Zira's
   protests. Taylor escapes and finds Dodge's stuffed corpse on display in
   a museum, he is soon recaptured revealing in the process he can speak,
   which alarms the apes.
   Cornelius (McDowall), Zira (Hunter), and Taylor (Heston)

   A hearing to determine Taylor's origins is convened. Taylor mentions
   his two comrades, learning that Landon was lobotomized and rendered
   catatonic. Believing Taylor is from an unknown human tribe beyond their
   borders, Zaius privately threatens to castrate and lobotomize Taylor
   for refusing to reveal his origins. With help from Zira's nephew
   Lucius, Zira and Cornelius free Taylor and Nova and take them to the
   Forbidden Zone, a taboo region outside Ape City where Taylor's ship
   crashed. Ape law has ruled the area out of bounds for centuries.
   Cornelius and Zira are intent to gather proof of an earlier non-simian
   civilization - which Cornelius discovered a year earlier - to be
   cleared of heresy; Taylor focuses on proving he comes from a different
   planet.

   When the group arrives at the cave, Cornelius is intercepted by Zaius
   and his soldiers. Taylor holds them off by threatening to shoot Zaius,
   who agrees to enter the cave to disprove their theories. Inside,
   Cornelius displays remnants of a technologically advanced human society
   pre-dating simian history. Taylor identifies artifacts such as
   dentures, eyeglasses, a heart valve, and to the apes' astonishment, a
   child's talking doll. Zaius admits he has always known about the
   ancient human civilization. Taylor wants to search for answers,
   ignoring Zaius' warning he may dislike what he finds. After Taylor and
   Nova are allowed to leave, Dr. Zaius has the cave sealed-off to destroy
   the evidence while charging Zira, Cornelius, and Lucius with heresy.
   Taylor, Nova (Harrison), and
   the Statue of Liberty

   Taylor and Nova follow the shoreline on horseback and eventually
   discover the remnants of the Statue of Liberty, revealing that this
   'alien' planet is actually Earth long after an apocalyptic nuclear war.
   Understanding Zaius' earlier warning, Taylor falls to his knees in
   despair and condemns humanity for destroying the world.

     Oh, my God. I'm back. I'm home. All the time, it was . . . we
     finally really did it.
     You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!
