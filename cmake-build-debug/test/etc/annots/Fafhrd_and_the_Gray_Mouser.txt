   Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are two sword-and-sorcery heroes appearing
   in stories written by American author Fritz Leiber. They are the
   protagonists of what are probably Leiber's best-known stories. One of
   his motives in writing them was to have a couple of fantasy heroes
   closer to true human nature than the likes of Howard's Conan the
   Barbarian or Burroughs's Tarzan.^[1]

   Fafhrd is a very tall (nearly seven feet) and strong northern
   barbarian, skilled at both swordsmanship and singing. The Mouser is a
   small (not much more than five feet) mercurial thief, gifted and deadly
   at swordsmanship (often using a sword in one hand and a long dagger or
   main-gauche in the other), as well as a former wizard's apprentice who
   retains some skill at magic. Fafhrd talks like a romantic, but his
   strength and practicality usually wins through, while the
   cynical-sounding Mouser is prone to showing strains of sentiment at
   unexpected times. Both are rogues, living in a decadent world where
   only the ruthless and cynical survive. They spend a lot of time
   drinking, feasting, wenching, brawling, stealing, and gambling, while
   are seldom fussy about who hires their swords. Still, they are humane
   and--most of all--relish true adventure.

   The characters were loosely modeled upon Leiber himself and his friend
   Harry Otto Fischer. Fischer initially created them in a letter to
   Leiber in September 1934, naming at the same time their home city of
   Lankhmar. In 1936, Leiber finished the first Fafhrd and Gray Mouser
   novella, "Adept's Gambit", and began work on a second, "The Tale of the
   Grain Ships". At the same time, Fischer was writing the beginning of
   "The Lords of Quarmall". "Adept's Gambit" would not see publication
   until 1947, while "The Lords of Quarmall" would be finished by Leiber
   and published in 1964. His second story, "The Tale of the Grain Ships",
   would become the prototype for "Scylla's Daughter" (1961) and, later,
   the novel The Swords of Lankhmar (1968).

   The stories of the two were only loosely connected until the 1960s,
   when Leiber organized them chronologically and added additional
   material in preparation for paperback publication. Starting as young
   men, the two separately meet their female lovers, meet each other, and
   lose both their lovers in the same night, which explains both their
   friendship and the arrested adolescence of their lifestyles. However,
   in later stories, the two mature, learn leadership, and eventually
   settle down with new female partners on the Iceland-like Rime Isle.
   Leiber contemplated continuing the series beyond this point, but died
   prior to doing so.
