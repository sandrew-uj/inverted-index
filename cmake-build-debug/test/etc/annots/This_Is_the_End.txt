   Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles to visit old friend and fellow
   Canadian actor Seth Rogen, who invites him to a housewarming party
   hosted by James Franco. There, Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded
   party, so Seth accompanies him to a convenience store where beams of
   blue light suddenly come down and suck numerous people into the sky,
   prompting Seth and Jay to flee back to James' house. An earthquake then
   strikes and the crowd rushes outside, witnessing a sinkhole opening up
   in James' yard. Several celebrities are killed as Seth, Jay, James,
   Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson run back inside the house, where Jay
   tells the remaining party-goers that the earthquake has destroyed most
   of Los Angeles. They then take inventory of their supplies, set up a
   ration system, board up the house and await help.

   The next morning, Danny McBride, who crashed the party and fell asleep,
   wakes up first and wastes most of the group's food and water due to his
   ignorance of the crisis. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the
   previous night's events until a man outside is decapitated by an unseen
   creature. Tensions rise due to various conflicts, including Jay and
   Seth's growing estrangement and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief
   that the disaster might be the Apocalypse predicted in the Book of
   Revelation. Emma Watson makes her way back to James' house, but due to
   a misunderstanding, she believes the group is planning to rape her and
   leaves with the group's remaining drinks.

   Craig goes for water stored in James' cellar, but he encounters an
   unknown being, causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig
   through the floor and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of
   spite and the others excommunicate him. Before leaving, Danny reveals
   that Jay was in town two months prior, but stayed at a hotel instead of
   with Seth because of their strained friendship. That night, Jonah prays
   for Jay to die and is possessed by a demon. Seth and James are attacked
   by the possessed Jonah, but Jay and Craig subdue Jonah and tie him up.
   During an exorcism attempt, Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle,
   starting a fire that engulfs Jonah and the house and forces the others
   outside.

   James suggests driving to his home in Malibu, California, but finds his
   car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is
   raptured into Heaven when the plan succeeds; the others realize they
   can save themselves by performing a selfless act. On the way to Malibu,
   the three encounter cannibals led by Danny and his gimp, Channing
   Tatum. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins
   to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny, the beam
   vanishes and Danny and the other cannibals eat James alive while Seth
   and Jay escape and encounter Satan. Jay apologizes to Seth for his
   wrongdoings while Satan attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay and he
   begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand, but his
   presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven; Seth forces Jay to
   leave him behind whereupon another beam appears around Seth. The pair
   finally arrive in Heaven where they are reunited with Craig, who tells
   them that any wish comes true. After Jay wishes for the Backstreet
   Boys, the band performs "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" as everyone in
   Heaven dances.
