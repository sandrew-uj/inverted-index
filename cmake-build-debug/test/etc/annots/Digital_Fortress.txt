   The story is set in the year of 1996. When the United States National
   Security Agency's code-breaking supercomputer TRANSLTR encounters a
   revolutionary new code, Digital Fortress, that it cannot break,
   Commander Trevor Strathmore calls in head cryptographer Susan Fletcher
   to crack it. She is informed by Strathmore that it was written by Ensei
   Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with the NSA's
   intrusion into people's private lives. If the NSA doesn't reveal
   TRANSLTR to the public, Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm
   on his website and have his partner, "North Dakota", release it for
   free if he dies, essentially holding the NSA hostage. Strathmore tells
   Fletcher that Tankado has in fact died in Seville at the age of 32, of
   what appears to be a heart attack. Strathmore intends to keep Tankado's
   death a secret because if Tankado's partner finds out, he will upload
   the code. The agency is determined to stop Digital Fortress from
   becoming a threat to national security.

   Strathmore asks Fletcher's fiance David Becker to travel to Seville and
   recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is
   suspected to have the passcode that unlocks Digital Fortress. However,
   Becker soon discovers that Tankado gave the ring away just before his
   death. Unbeknown to Becker, a mysterious figure, named Hulohot, follows
   him, and murders each person he questions in the search for the ring.
   Unsurprisingly, Hulohot's final attempt would be on Becker himself.

   Meanwhile, telephone calls between North Dakota and Tokugen Numataka
   (chairman of the Japanese computer company Numatech) reveal that North
   Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to gain access to the
   passcode on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. At the
   NSA, Fletcher's investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a
   fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA
   technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure
   and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own
   investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to
   bypass Gauntlet, the NSA's virus/worm filter. To save the TRANSLTR he
   decides to shut it down but is murdered after being pushed off
   sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and
   Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is
   the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing
   Chartrukian. Chartrukian's fall also damages TRANSLTR's cooling system.

   Hale holds Fletcher and Strathmore hostage to prevent himself from
   being arrested for the murder. It is then that Hale explains, the
   e-mail he supposedly received from Tankado was also in Strathmore's
   inbox as he was snooping on Tankado. Fletcher discovers through a
   tracer that North Dakota and Ensei Tankado are the same person, as
   "NDAKOTA" is an anagram of "Tankado." Based on Chartrukian's
   investigation, and further detail from Hale, Fletcher realises that
   Digital Fortress is a virus, and not an encryption algorithm.

   Strathmore kills Hale and arranges it to appear as a suicide. Fletcher
   later discovers through Strathmore's pager that he is the one who hired
   Hulohot. Becker manages to track down the ring, but ends up pursued by
   Hulohot in a long cat-and-mouse chase across Seville. The two
   eventually face off in a cathedral, where Becker finally kills Hulohot
   by tripping him down a spiral staircase, causing him to break his neck.
   He is then intercepted by NSA field agents sent by Leland Fontaine, the
   director of the NSA.

   Chapters told from Strathmore's perspective reveal master plan. By
   hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring and at
   the same time arranging for Hulohot to kill him, he would facilitate a
   romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor. He has
   also been working incessantly for many months to unlock Digital
   Fortress, installing a backdoor inside the program. By making phone
   calls to Numataka posing as North Dakota, he thought he could partner
   with Numatech to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own
   backdoor Trojan. Finally, he would reveal to the world the existence of
   TRANSLTR, boasting it would be able to crack all the encryption schemes
   except Digital Fortress, making everyone rushing to use the computer
   chip equipped with Digital Fortress so that the NSA could spy on every
   computer equipped with these chips. However, Strathmore was unaware
   that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm that, once unlocked
   would "eat away" at the NSA databank's security and allow "any
   third-grader with a modem" to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR
   overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to the machine
   as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but Becker
   eventually figures out the password just seconds before the last
   defense fall (3, the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb,
   Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to
   the nuclear bombs that killed Tankado's mother and left him crippled),
   and Fletcher is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any
   significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States,
   reuniting him with Fletcher.

   In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka was Ensei Tankado's
   father; Numataka left Tankado the day he was born due to Tankado's
   deformity. As Tankado's last living relative, Numataka inherits the
   rest of Tankado's possessions.
