   CIA operative John Clark forms a secret multi-national
   counter-terrorist unit known as Rainbow. Based in Hereford, England,
   the unit consists of two operational squads composed of elite soldiers
   from NATO countries, and is supplemented by intelligence and
   technological experts from MI6, Mossad, and FBI. Clark serves as the
   commanding officer, his son-in-law Domingo Chavez leads one of the two
   squads, and the second in command is Special Air Service (SAS) officer
   Alistair Stanley.

   For their first deployment, Chavez's squad rescues hostages during a
   bank robbery in Bern, Switzerland. Several weeks later, they are
   deployed to Austria, where a group of left-wing German terrorists have
   taken over the schloss of a wealthy Austrian businessman in order to
   obtain "special access codes" to the international trading markets.
   They are then deployed to a hostage situation in an amusement park in
   Spain, where a group of French terrorists have taken a group of
   children hostage and demand that various prisoners, including Carlos
   the Jackal, be released.

   Clark and his colleagues become suspicious about the sudden rise in
   terrorist attacks. Unbeknownst to them, the first two attacks are part
   of a master plan to wipe out nearly all of the human race, codenamed
   "the Project". Dr. John Brightling, a staunch environmentalist who
   heads a biotechnology firm called the Horizon Corporation, ordered the
   attacks through ex-KGB officer Dmitriy Popov in order to raise
   awareness against terrorism, which would then allow co-conspirator Bill
   Henriksen's security firm to land a key contract during the Olympic
   Games in Sydney, Australia. From within the Olympics security
   apparatus, Henriksen plans to use a bioweapon containing the Shiva
   virus, a strengthened form of the Ebola virus that had been used by
   Iran in its biological attack on the U.S. Since people from virtually
   every country in the world are present at the Olympics, infecting them
   would ensure the swift worldwide spread of the virus. The resulting
   epidemic would kill millions, and Horizon would distribute a "vaccine"
   that actually contains a slow-acting version of the virus itself, which
   would then kill the rest of the world's population. The "chosen few",
   having been provided with the real vaccine, would then be allowed to
   inherit the emptied world.

   Popov, unaware of the Project, discovers the existence of Rainbow as he
   reviews the responses to his attacks, and brings it to Brightling's
   attention. He is later tasked by Brightling and Henriksen to
   orchestrate an attack on Rainbow in order to prevent them from being
   deployed to the Sydney Olympics. He persuades breakaway members of the
   Provisional Irish Republican Army to take over a hospital near
   Rainbow's base and take Clark and Chavez's wives hostage. While two
   Rainbow operatives are killed and several others wounded in an ambush,
   Rainbow teams manage to retake the building without civilian casualties
   and capture some of the terrorists. Interrogation reveals Popov's
   involvement, and Brightling brings him to Horizon's secret base in
   Kansas. Upon learning about the Project, an appalled Popov escapes and
   reveals his knowledge to Clark. Meanwhile, Chavez and his team, who
   were deployed to the Olympics to oversee venue security, thwart the
   attack.

   Their plans in shambles, Brightling and key co-conspirators escape to
   another, smaller Horizon base deep in the Brazilian rain forest. Clark
   personally leads a team there, and they dispatch the remaining
   terrorists and destroy the facility and supplies. Knowing that there is
   not enough evidence to convict them, Clark instead has the survivors
   stripped naked and left to fend for themselves in the jungle, taunting
   them to "reconnect with nature."
