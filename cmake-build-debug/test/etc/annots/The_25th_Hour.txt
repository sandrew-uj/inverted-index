   The idea for the book came when Benioff returned home to New York for
   Passover while he was away working in Wyoming. He suffered from
   appendicitis and had to undergo emergency surgery. Benioff said:
   "Walking the halls of Mount Sinai afterward, seeing people walking up
   5th Avenue and Central Park and trapped in the hospital, I had a sense
   of being so close to the city and not being a part of it." He
   continued: "I thought, 'What if you are not stuck for five days, but
   seven years?' And that is writing what you don't know. Taking a banal
   problem and making it much more serious."

   Benioff spent two years writing the novel, and completed the book as
   his thesis for a Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing at the
   University of California Irvine in 1999. The book was
   originally titled Fireman Down, but was changed to The 25th Hour on the
   advice of the publisher who accepted the book with a $7,500
   advance. The book was published in 2001.

   He was asked to adapt the book into a screenplay by Tobey Maguire, who
   had read a preliminary trade copy and became interested in making a
   film of the book. It was filmed as 25th Hour, starring Edward
   Norton and directed by Spike Lee.
