   A young man (provisionally called Pardero) has lost his
   memory--remembering almost nothing of his past.^[2]^[3]^[4] Acting on
   good advice, he earns enough money by menial labor to travel to the
   Connatic's free hospital on the capital planet Numenes. There, after
   much research, medical technicians are able to deduce from his
   reactions to various stimuli that he is a Rhune from the sparsely
   populated planet Marune^[3]--a planet illuminated by four stars (Suns).
   The Rhunes are a somewhat peculiar people who, among other traits, have
   a strong aversion to killing (unless it be in combat). From this and
   other clues, the man becomes convinced some enemy has caused his
   amnesia. He journeys home to find he is the ruler (Kaiark) of a small
   kingdom. He has to tread carefully, unsure of whom he can trust, in his
   quest to unmask his foe. Determined to unveil the identity of his
   enemy, who has erased his memory, he will clash with the strange
   customs of his people, based on the illumination provided by the four
   suns: in particular during the Mirk, when all the suns set in the sky
   and night falls, the men and women of Marune are left to strange
   behaviors. The novel ends abruptly.^[5]
