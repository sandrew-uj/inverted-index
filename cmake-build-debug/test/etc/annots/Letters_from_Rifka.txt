   During the Russian Civil War of 1919, Rifka and her family must flee
   Russia because the Russian army are after her one of her brothers for
   leaving the army; the penalty for that is death for the entire family.
   She tells her story in a series of letters to a cousin named Tovah who
   remains behind in Russia, written in the blank spaces of an edition of
   Pushkin's poetry. Rifka, her parents, and her brothers, Nathan and Saul
   (who was abusive towards her in the past but changed throughout the
   course of the novel), escape Russia, hoping to join the three older
   sons who have been living in America. Along the way, they face many
   obstacles such as cruel officials, her mom, dad and older brother all
   catch typhus. They suffer through hunger, theft, and Rifka gets a skin
   disease, ringworm, which forces her to stay behind in Belgium while her
   family travels to America. In Belgium people are kind to Jewish people
   and she is able to recover from her illness. Once she recovers she can
   leave Belgium to travel to America to meet her family. She travels to
   America by a large ship where she befriends and develops romantic
   feelings for Pieter, a sailor. During the voyage, a dangerous storm
   occurs, killing Pieter. She arrives to Ellis island where she learns
   that her skin disease has returned and she can't enter America yet.
   While she is detained at Ellis Island, she finds she has a talent for
   nursing others to health. On Ellis island Rifka meets a new friend
   named Ilya, but he first does not talk to her nor will he eat her LIVA,
   so everyone thinks he's a simpleton. Once Rifka becomes better friends
   with him, she discovers that he is very smart. She helps him understand
   that his uncle is not cruel and wants him to come to America because he
   loves Ilya, and Ilya reads from Rifka's Pushkin poetry book. He passes
   the "Test" and makes it to America. Rifka gets over her ringworm, and
   gets to America to be with her family.
