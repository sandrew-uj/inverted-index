   The book describes the lives of eight female friends after their
   graduation in 1933 from Vassar College, beginning with the marriage of
   one of them, Kay Strong, and ending with her funeral in 1940. Each
   character struggles with different issues, including sexism in the work
   place, child-rearing, financial difficulties, family crises, and sexual
   relationships. Nearly all the women's issues involve the men in their
   lives: fathers, employers, lovers, or husbands. As highly educated
   women from affluent backgrounds, they must strive for autonomy and
   independence in a time when a woman's role is still largely restricted
   to marriage and childbirth. The plot is influenced by the political and
   economic atmosphere of the time. Over the course of the book, the
   reader is exposed to the women's views on contraception, love, sex,
   socialism and psychoanalysis.
