   Demon takes place in the years 2113 through 2121, thirteen to
   twenty-one years after the events of Wizard. Cirocco Jones has become a
   combination fugitive and resistance leader, staying alive in spite of
   the forces of Gaea by virtue of her unusual abilities, and with the
   help of friends and allies. These include the race of Titanides, who
   remain loyal to the Captain, as they call Jones, rather than to Gaea;
   and the race of Angels, who call her the Wing Commander. The militant
   creations of Gaea, once limited to the buzz-bombs, have expanded to
   include horrifying beings called Priests, each one made by Gaea from
   parts of her human victims. The Priests, named after significant
   religious figures from the past, carry out her dirty work as a class of
   undead field commanders, supported by bands of zombies. These are made
   from the corpses of humans who die in the wheel and -- unless cremated
   -- become infested with creatures called deathsnakes and arise to walk
   again as zombies.

   Due to the aging process in the body of Gaea, some regions are out of
   her control as the regional "brain" has died or, according to Gaea
   herself, become part of a rebellion against her. In the region known as
   Dione the local brain is dead, allowing Cirocco and her companions some
   degree of safety from Gaea, if not from her agents. Dione is in
   permanent twilight due to its position in the wheel. It is also the
   location of the anarchic human city of Bellinzona. Meanwhile, Gaea has
   developed advanced versions of the "buzz bombs" from the previous
   novel, up to and including jet bombers capable of dropping bombs and
   deploying semi-intelligent heat-seeking missiles. These live in
   squadrons high up on the support cables of regions loyal to Gaea, ready
   to drop on any armies below.
