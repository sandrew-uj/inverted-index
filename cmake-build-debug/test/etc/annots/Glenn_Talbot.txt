   Talbot appears in the 2003 live-action film Hulk, portrayed by Josh
   Lucas. This version is a former military officer-turned-bio-science
   executive at a Defense Department contractor called Atheon. He is also
   a former college acquaintance of Betty Ross and serves under her
   father, Thaddeus. Talbot seeks to obtain a tissue sample from the Hulk
   for military supersoldier-based applications. During this endeavor,
   however, he fires an explosive missile at the Hulk, which ricochets off
   of his skin, killing Talbot in the ensuing explosion during the Hulk's
   escape from Gamma Base.
