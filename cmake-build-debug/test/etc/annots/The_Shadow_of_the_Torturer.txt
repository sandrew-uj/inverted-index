   Severian, an apprentice in the Torturers' Guild, barely survives a swim
   in the River Gyoll. On his way back to the Citadel, Severian and
   several other apprentices sneak into a necropolis where Severian
   encounters Vodalus, a legendary revolutionary. Vodalus, along with two
   others, including a woman named Thea, are robbing a grave. Vodalus and
   his companions are confronted by volunteer guards. Severian saves
   Vodalus's life, earning his trust and the reward of a single coin.

   Shortly before Severian is elevated to journeyman he encounters and
   falls in love with Thecla, a beautiful aristocratic prisoner. Thecla's
   crime is never made clear, though it is implied that she is imprisoned
   for political reasons since Thecla's half-sister is Thea, Vodalus's
   lover. The Autarch (ruler of the Commonwealth) wishes to use Thecla to
   capture Vodalus. When finally Thecla is put to torture, Severian takes
   pity on her and helps her commit suicide by smuggling a knife into her
   cell, thus breaking his oath to the guild.

   Though Severian expects to be tortured and executed, instead the head
   of the guild dispatches Severian to Thrax, a distant city which has
   need of an executioner. Master Palaemon gives Severian a letter of
   introduction to the archon of the city and Terminus Est, a magnificent
   executioner's sword. He departs the guild headquarters, traveling
   through the decaying city of Nessus. He finally comes upon an inn,
   where he forces the innkeeper to take him in despite being full and is
   asked to share a room with other boarders. His roommates are the giant
   Baldanders and Dr. Talos, travelling as mountebanks, who invite
   Severian to join them in a play to be performed the same day. During
   breakfast, Dr. Talos manages to recruit the waitress, Jolenta, for his
   play and they set out into the streets.

   Not intending to participate, Severian parts with the group and stops
   at a rag shop to purchase a mantle to hide his fuligin cloak (the
   uniform of his guild, which inspires terror in common folk). The shop
   is owned by a twin brother and sister, and the brother immediately
   takes interest in Terminus Est, but Severian refuses to sell the sword.
   Shortly after, a masked and armoured hipparch enters the shop and
   challenges Severian to a duel. Severian, who believes this is an
   indirect means for the Autarch to execute him for his crime, is forced
   to accept, and he departs with the sister, Agia, to secure an avern, a
   deadly plant used for dueling. While on their way, urged by Agia's bet
   to a passing fiacre, their driver crashes into and destroys the altar
   of a religious order, where Agia is accused of stealing a precious
   artifact. After Agia is searched and released, they continue their
   journey to the Botanic Gardens, a large landmark of Nessus created by
   the mysterious Father Inire, right hand to the Autarch, where they
   encounter strange hypnotic illusions and at one point appear to be
   transported to present-day Earth without realizing it.

   Inside the gardens, Severian falls into a lake used to inter the dead,
   and while pulling himself out he finds a young woman named Dorcas to
   have come up from the lake as well. Dazed and confused, the woman
   follows Severian and Agia. Severian secures the avern with the help of
   a man named Hildegrin, who he recognizes as a companion of Vodalus from
   the night they met in the necropolis. Agia, Severian and Dorcas proceed
   to an inn near the dueling grounds. While eating dinner, Severian
   receives a mysterious note warning about one of the women. After
   dinner, Severian fights in the duel, and though stabbed by the avern he
   miraculously survives. When Severian wakes again, he finds himself to
   be in a lazaret. After finding Dorcas and identifying himself, he is
   requested to perform an execution. The prisoner turns out to be his
   opponent, Agia's brother, whom he executes after learning that Agia had
   challenged him in disguise, while her brother fought him with the
   avern, as part of a scheme to kill him and steal Terminus Est.

   Severian continues his travels toward Thrax, and Dorcas accompanies
   him. While searching his belongings, Severian finds the Claw of the
   Conciliator. Apparently Agia stole the Claw from the altar they
   destroyed and placed it in Severian's belongings knowing that she would
   be searched. Eventually Severian and Dorcas encounter Dr. Talos,
   Baldanders and Jolenta, who are almost ready to perform the play they
   had invited Severian to the morning before. Severian assists in the
   play, and the next day the group sets out toward the great gate leading
   out of Nessus, where they meet a man named Jonas. As they are passing
   through the gate, there is suddenly a commotion and the narration
   abruptly ends.
