   The Wolves in the Walls is a book by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean,
   published in 2003, in the United States by HarperCollins, and in the
   United Kingdom by Bloomsbury. The book was highly praised on release,
   winning three awards for that year. In 2006, it was made into a musical
   which toured the UK and visited the US in 2007.^[1]

   Neil Gaiman has said the story was inspired by a nightmare his daughter
   Maddy, then aged 4, had that there were wolves in the walls.^[1]^[2] In
   the story the protagonist, Lucy, hears wolves in the walls of her
   family's house, but her family does not believe her until one day when
   the wolves come out of the walls.^[2] The book is notable for Dave
   McKean's art, which utilises many different techniques, including
   photography, computer-generated imagery and drawing to achieve its
   effect.^[3]

   It is also available in Spanish,^[4]^[5] German^[6] and Italian.^[7]
