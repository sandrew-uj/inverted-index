   The hero of Jane's story is a superb physical specimen of English
   manhood named Thomas Plummer. He is being sent to medical school by his
   father, a medical entrepreneur (pill manufacturer)--despite the fact
   that the younger Plummer is, well, not very bright. At medical school
   Plummer meets a young, dark-skinned woman called Miss Zumeena. The
   young woman invites him to tea, which takes place in her summer house
   (which is oddly full of machinery). A few seconds later, she informs
   the young Englishman that he is now on Venus. The machinery in
   Zumeena's gazebo operates a matter transmitter that allows almost
   instantaneous transport between the two planets.

   (This constitutes "One of the earliest uses of the matter transmitter
   for interplanetary travel"^[5] in science fiction. Jane does not spend
   much effort on explaining how a matter transmitter might actually work;
   the technology is merely a given, like the titular device in H. G.
   Wells's The Time Machine of 1895.)

   Closer to the Sun than Earth, Venus is hot and jungle-covered; the
   glare of the Sun both blinds the eyes and affects the mind. The planet
   is inhabited by two developed species, the human Sutenraa and the
   decidedly non-human Thotheen. Zumeena is a Sutenraa, a people from
   Central America via ancient Egypt, which are closely related in Jane's
   imaginary domain. (This incorporates another subgenre of fantastic
   fiction of Jane's era, books on Egypt, the pyramids, and related
   matters.)^[6] These highly-advanced ancients developed a matter
   transmitter in their distant past, and used it to travel back and forth
   between the pyramids of Egypt and Central America; in the process they
   sometimes found themselves on Venus, apparently due to interference
   with the similar matter transmitter technology of the Thotheen. The
   latter are the dominant indigenous species of the planet; Jane both
   describes and draws Thotheen as a cross between a small elephant and a
   large horse-fly.

   Some of the Central-American/Egyptians settled on Venus to form a
   growing human community; they often served as physicians to the
   Thotheen. At the time of Plummer's arrival on Venus, the long
   co-existence between the two species is breaking down; Zumeena predicts
   that conflict will soon erupt between them, which the Thotheen will win
   due to their superior intelligence. Plummer also learns that he has
   been brought to Venus as a subject for vivisection, because of his
   excellent physique. Zumeena has taken a fancy to him, though; she makes
   romantic advances to him, which he spurns. She reluctantly consigns him
   to vivisection (though she allows him the option of anesthesia).

   Plummer meets two other English people on Venus, a young woman named
   Phyllis Alson and a clergyman. He and Phyllis quickly fall in love; the
   convenient clergyman marries them. War breaks out, first a civil war
   among the Thotheen and then the conflict between the Thotheen and
   Sutenraa anticipated by Zumeena. Plummer and Phyllis escape to Earth
   with Zumeena (the clergyman is by now dead) via matter transmitter;
   they land on the pinnacle of the Great Pyramid at Giza. There, Plummer
   finds one of his father's agents stenciling an advertisement in white
   paint. The young English couple return home, while Zumeena goes south
   to become a "goddess" for some primitive people. This is a reference to
   another popular subgenre of Victorian fantastic fiction, the "lost
   world" or "lost race" stories like H. Rider Haggard's She (1886) and
   its many imitations.

   To Venus in Five Seconds has been called "The most readable and
   entertaining of Jane's books".^[7] Jane wrote other works of
   speculative fiction, notably The Incubated Girl (1896) and The Violet
   Flame (1899).
