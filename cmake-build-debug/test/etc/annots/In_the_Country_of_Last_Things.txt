   The novel takes the form of a letter from a young woman named Anna
   Blume. Anna has ventured into an unnamed city that has collapsed into
   chaos and disorder. In this environment, no industry takes place and
   most of the population collects garbage or scavenges for objects to
   resell. Anna has entered the city to search for her brother William, a
   journalist, and it is suggested that the Blumes come from a world to
   the East which has not collapsed.

   Anna arrives in the city with William's address, and an address and
   photo for Samuel Farr, whom William's editor sent to the city after
   failing to receive word from William. However, in a turn of events she
   later understands to be typical of life in the city, she finds that not
   only has William's house been demolished, but the entire street where
   he lived has been reduced to rubble. Anna lives on the streets of the
   city as an 'object hunter', a job which involves scavenging for
   specific objects rather than collecting general waste.

   One day, Anna saves the life of Isabel, an older woman. Isabel is, like
   Anna, an object hunter, despite her advanced age, and has an uncanny
   knowledge of where and when to find the objects they require. She lives
   with her husband, Ferdinand, a rude man who does not work, but makes
   ships in bottles from small waste materials he finds. Ferdinand tries
   to rape Anna, but she, trying to scare him away, accidentally starts to
   strangle him and gives up before he dies, while Isabel is supposedly
   asleep. Anna and Isabel discover that Ferdinand had died in the
   morning, hinting that Isabel had finished the job later that evening.
   Isabel and Anna, not wanting to simply leave his body in the street or
   carry it to a crematorium, throw it from the roof of their apartment
   building, making it seem as if Ferdinand had committed suicide. Soon
   after, Isabel becomes ill, and can no longer work. She dies, and after
   Anna has taken her body to be cremated, housebreakers arrive at her
   apartment and overpower her, making her homeless once again.

   After having been homeless for a period, Anna is forced to run from a
   police officer, and goes through the first open door she sees, which
   turns out to be the city's national library. Parts of the library have
   been allocated by the government for academics and religious groups.
   She meets a rabbi, leading a small group of Jewish inhabitants of the
   city. Anna reveals that she too is a Jew, but no longer believes in God
   (see Jewish atheism). The group cannot help Anna on her mission to find
   William, but one of the rabbi's accomplices directs her to Samuel Farr,
   who it transpires is also living in the library.

   Despite initial hostility, Sam accepts Anna into his life, and the two
   live together and become lovers. Sam is working on a book about the
   city, but is swiftly running out of money. Anna remedies the couple's
   financial situation with the money she has obtained from selling Isabel
   and Ferdinand's possessions, and the two are able to live in relative
   comfort and afford luxury items such as cigarettes. This period is
   described as one of Anna's happiest. However, the Jewish groups are
   forced to leave the library when the government decides to exert its
   authority, and are replaced by a man named Dujardin, of whom Anna is
   suspicious.

   Anna's shoes start to wear out, and Sam refuses to let Anna leave their
   apartment until he has procured a new pair, especially because Anna is
   now pregnant. This takes time, however, and Anna is tempted by an offer
   from Dujardin to buy her a pair from his cousin, and, despite her
   initial dislike of him, she accepts his offer. She follows him to his
   cousin's house, but realizes she has been tricked, and that the house
   is a human slaughterhouse. Anna jumps from a window and escapes, and is
   taken in by the patrons of Woburn House, a homeless shelter. When she
   awakes, she lives in luxury, but is deeply distressed to hear that a
   fire has broken out at the library, Sam's whereabouts are unknown, and
   she has had a miscarriage. Anna takes a position at Woburn House, and
   becomes close to her colleagues; Victoria, the daughter of the House's
   founder, Dr. Woburn; Frick, an older man who serves as a driver and has
   a strange way of speaking; Willie, Frick's introverted fifteen-year-old
   grandson; and Boris Stepanovich, an enigmatic character responsible for
   procuring food and supplies for the House.

   Anna enters a love affair with Victoria, which helps her recover from
   losing Sam. She is appointed to a position in which she interviews
   prospective residents of the House, which she finds emotionally
   draining. She vents her anger on an interviewee, then falls asleep, and
   awakes to find Sam sitting opposite her. He has lived in an abandoned
   railway station since the fire in the library, and has become almost
   unrecognizable. He is taken in immediately, though, and begins to make
   progress. When he returns to full health, Victoria asks him to
   contribute to the House by pretending to be a doctor: there is no
   longer any medical equipment except for painkillers and bandages, so
   the charade is unlikely to be uncovered, and people enjoy telling him
   their stories. However, Boris tells Anna that Woburn House is
   financially unsustainable, as it relies on a finite supply of items
   taken from Dr. Woburn's collection. She comes to realize that the House
   cannot continue forever, and cutbacks are made to the provisions
   granted to residents.

   Frick dies, and is given a burial in the House's garden, against the
   city's laws. However, the burial is reported to the police by an
   unknown resident, and they arrive to dig up the body. The police are
   dissuaded by Boris Stepanovich from taking further measures, but Willie
   has been deeply affected by the events. He starts to act erratically,
   and eventually violently, taking a gun and murdering several residents
   of the House, before turning on Victoria, Sam and Anna. Sam shoots him
   before he can reach them, but too much damage has been done to the
   House and its reputation for it to continue.

   The House closes down and, with the last of their money (taken from
   selling the remnants of the Woburn collection and Boris's personal
   wealth), the four obtain travel permits. The novel ends with Anna
   considering the best way for them to leave the city, and telling the
   unknown acquaintance to whom she is writing that she will write again.
   It is unknown whether the letter was sent, and whether Anna, Victoria,
   Sam and Boris were successful in their attempt to leave the city.

   The 'last things' in the title of the book refers not only to the
   disappearance of manufactured objects and technology but also the
   fading of memories of them and the words used to describe them.
