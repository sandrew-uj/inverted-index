   Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's is set in the future in Neo Domino City.

   Seventeen years prior, a reactor called Moment within the city
   malfunctioned and caused a great earthquake that split the city in two
   parts: Satellite, the rundown and poverty-stricken part (also the
   former Domino City), and Neo Domino City, the wealthier and urban part.
   In order to keep the two areas separate, access to the city from the
   Satellite is strictly prohibited and can result in imprisonment. Yusei
   Fudo, an aspiring duelist from Satellite, builds his own Duel Runner
   (D-Wheel in the Japanese version), but his best friend Jack Atlas
   betrays him and steals his vehicle along with his most precious
   monster, Stardust Dragon, escaping to Neo Domino.

   Two years later, Yusei builds another one and secretly travels to the
   city to win back his Dragon. Jack has made a name for himself and his
   monster, Red Archfiend Dragon, as the current Turbo Duel King in Neo
   Domino City. Yusei and Jack face each other in a turbo duel, Yusei and
   Jack's arms glow red, a third red dragon appears, and brings an abrupt
   end to the fight. This attracts the attention of Rex Goodwin, the head
   of the Public Security Maintenance Bureau, who reveals to Jack a five
   thousand year old secret, involving the "People of the Stars" (no,
   Hoshi no Tami), a pre-Incan civilization, the "Crimson Dragon" (ki,
   Akaki Ryu), and "Signers" (SiGuNa-6, Shiguna), identified by a red
   birthmark on their arm that represents a part of the dragon. Goodwin
   also reveals that Jack and Yusei are both Signers and holds a
   tournament to find the other three. Two of the other signers turn out
   to be child duelist Luna and psychic duelist Akiza. In the final
   battle, all four Signers see a vision of the future with the Satellite
   in ruins.

   Goodwin reveals that the Signers are destined to face the Dark Signers,
   duelists resurrected from the dead to serve the evil Earthbound Gods.
   The Signers head to Satellite to face the Dark Signers which consist
   of: Roman Goodwin (Rex's brother, a former Signer with the dragon's
   Head mark and leader of the Dark Signers), Kalin Kessler (a former
   friend of Yusei, Jack and Crow Hogan), Devack (the one who stole the
   Ancient Fairy Dragon card, Luna's Signer Dragon), Misty Tredwell (a
   model who blames Akiza for the death of her brother Toby), Greiger (who
   blamed Rex Goodwin for his village's disappearance), and briefly Carly
   (a blogger with feelings for Jack). With the help of Leo, Luna's twin
   brother, and Crow Hogan, Yusei and Jack's best friend, they are able to
   defeat all the Dark Signers. However, Rex Goodwin reveals that he has
   become a Dark Signer and uses his brother's severed arm to become a
   Signer as well. With the power of both the light and the shadows, he
   wishes to rebuild the world in his image. Yusei, Jack and Crow then
   face him in a turbo duel in order to stop him and King of the
   Netherworld from finishing off the Signers and destroying the world.
   Before the final attack, Yusei gains the Head mark, making him the new
   leader, while Crow gains his former Tail mark, making him the fifth
   Signer. With the power of the Crimson Dragon and Yusei's Majestic Star
   Dragon, he defeats Goodwin who, along with Roman, sacrifice themselves
   to destroy the King of the Netherworld and revive the Dark Signers as
   normal people again.

   After the Dark Signers' defeat, Neo Domino City and Satellite are
   finally reunited into one prosperous city with the building of the
   "Daedalus Bridge", an intricate net of roads linking both Satellite and
   Neo Domino City with some sections also used for turbo duels. Yusei and
   his friends, now calling themselves "Team 5D's", prepare for the
   upcoming World Riding Duel Grand Prix (WRGP) tournament. A new threat
   appears, the Three Emperors of Iliaster, whose main monsters, the
   "Machine Emperors", can absorb Synchro Monsters from their opponents to
   empower themselves. Yusei encounters a fellow competitor, Sherry
   LeBlanc, who is investigating the Iliaster organization, that is
   reportedly responsible for her parents' deaths. Team 5D's is also
   joined by a mysterious amnesiac mechanic named Bruno, who quickly
   befriends the team and helps them prepare for the WRGP. The WRGP soon
   begins, with Team 5D's facing tough opponents such as Team Unicorn, a
   world-ranked dueling team, Team Taiyo, a new dueling team who started
   with nothing, and Team Ragnarok, who possess special abilities like the
   Signers. Team 5Ds eventually confront the Emperors themselves, who are
   revealed to be three different incarnations of Aporia, a cyborg sent
   from the future to destroy Neo Domino City to prevent a great calamity
   from befalling mankind in the future.

   Although Team 5D's defeats Aporia and wins the WRGP, a massive citadel
   known as the Ark Cradle appears and threatens to crash into Neo Domino
   City and destroy it. Team 5D's climbs aboard it to stop it. Before
   reaching the core of the fortress, they confront three individuals
   guarding its access: Akiza and Crow face Sherry, who was promised to
   have her parents returned to her; Yusei faces Bruno, who recovered his
   memories of being Antinomy, another member of Iliaster; and Jack, Leo
   and Luna face Aporia. Leo dies during the duel and is revived by the
   Crimson Dragon, becoming the sixth Signer bearing the mark of the
   dragon's Heart. When the Signers finally reach Z-one, Iliaster's
   leader, Yusei borrows his friends' dragons to add them to his deck, and
   challenges Z-one to a final turbo duel to decide Neo Domino City's
   future. Z-one is revealed to be a scientist from the future who assumed
   Yusei's identity and traveled back in time to prevent the destruction
   of humanity. Yusei manages to use his friends' cards to perform a
   "Limit Over Accel Synchro" and summon his strongest monster, "Shooting
   Quasar Dragon". After Z-one is defeated by Yusei, he decides to entrust
   the future of mankind to Yusei, and sacrifices himself to destroy the
   Ark Cradle and save Neo Domino City from destruction.

   A few months pass after the Signers' victory over Iliaster, and the
   former members of Team 5D's move on with their lives following separate
   paths. With one final duel between Jack and Yusei, they all part ways,
   except for Yusei, who decides to stay in Neo Domino City and research
   for a way to stop the destruction of humanity in the future. The other
   Signers leave the city knowing they will be connected with each other
   and will return after fulfilling their dreams.
