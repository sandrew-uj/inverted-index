   The story follows the adventures of Sir Philip Harclay, who returns to
   medieval England to find that Arthur Lord Lovel, the friend of his
   youth, is dead. His cousin Walter Lord Lovel had succeeded to the
   estate, and sold the family castle to the baron, Fitz-Owen. Among the
   baron's household were his two sons and daughter Emma, several young
   gentlemen relations being educated with the sons, and Edmund Twyford,
   the son of a peasant, who had been brought to live with them. When Sir
   Philip saw him, he took an immediate liking to him, being struck by his
   resemblance to his lost friend. The Knight proposing to take him into
   his own family, being childless, Edmund preferred to remain with the
   baron, receiving however an assurance that if ever he was in need of
   it, Sir Philip would renew his offer.

   The narrative then oversteps the interval of four years. By his
   manifestly superior nature and qualities Edmund had attracted the
   enmity of his benefactor's nephews, and the coldness of Sir Robert, the
   eldest son. William, his younger brother, is his staunch friend
   however, and Edmund is in love with the Lady Emma.
