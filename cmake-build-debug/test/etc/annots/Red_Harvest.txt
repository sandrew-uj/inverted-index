   The Continental Op is called to Personville (known as "Poisonville" to
   the locals) by the newspaper publisher Donald Willsson, who is murdered
   before the Op has a chance to meet with him. The Op begins to
   investigate Willsson's murder and meets with Willsson's father, Elihu
   Willsson, a local industrialist who has found his control of the city
   threatened by several competing gangs. Elihu had originally invited
   those gangs into Personville to help him impose and then enforce the
   end of a labor dispute.

   The Op extracts a promise and a signed letter from Elihu that pays the
   Continental Detective Agency, the Op's employer, $10,000 in exchange
   for cleaning up the city and ridding it of the gangs. When the Op
   solves Donald's murder, Elihu tries to renege on the deal, but the Op
   will not allow him to do so.

   In the meantime, the Op is spending time with Dinah Brand, a possible
   love interest of the late Donald Willsson and a moll for Max "Whisper"
   Thaler, a local gangster. Using information from Brand and
   Personville's crooked chief of police, Noonan, the Op manages to
   extract and spread incriminating information to all of the warring
   parties. When the Op reveals that a bank robbery was staged by the cops
   and one of the mobs to discredit another mob, a gang war erupts.

   The Op wakes up the next morning, though, to find Brand stabbed to
   death with the ice pick the Op handled the previous evening. No signs
   of forced entry are visible. The Op becomes a suspect sought by the
   police for Brand's murder, and one of his fellow operatives, Dick
   Foley, leaves Personville because he is uncertain of the Op's
   innocence.

   The Op, now wanted by the police, entices Reno Starkey, a gang
   lieutenant, to take on the last strong rival mob, led by Pete the Finn.
   The last gangs are whittled down by pipe bombs, arson, gun fights, and
   corrupt cops gunning down the survivors.

   The Op tracks down Starkey, the only gang leader still alive. Starkey
   is bleeding from four gunshot wounds, having just killed mobster
   Whisper Thaler. Starkey reveals that he was the one who stabbed Brand,
   and that she had collided with the semiconscious Op so he looked like
   the culprit.

   The corrupt police chief Noonan and the gang leaders are all dead. The
   Op blackmails Elihu Willsson into calling the governor, who sends in
   the National Guard, declares martial law, and suspends the entire
   police force. Elihu Willsson gets back his town, as promised, although
   not in the way that he had anticipated. The Op returns to San
   Francisco, where the Old Man (the chief of the Continental Detective
   Agency's office) gives him "merry hell" for his activities.
