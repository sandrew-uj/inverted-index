   Nineteen-year-old Martin Castillo is a boy from Buenos Aires trying to
   find his path in life. He meets and falls in love with Alejandra Vidal
   Olmos, who with her father Fernando represents the "old", post-colonial
   and autochthonous Argentina, which is seen mutating amid a strange and
   unsettling "new" world. The novel gives an evocative portrait of the
   city of Buenos Aires and its people.
