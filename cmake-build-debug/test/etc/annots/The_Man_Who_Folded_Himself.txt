   In 1975, Daniel Eakins, a young college student, is visited by his
   "Uncle Jim". Uncle Jim offers to increase Daniel's monthly allowance
   for living expenses as long as Daniel promises to keep a diary. Shortly
   after, Uncle Jim dies, and Daniel inherits a "Timebelt" from him that
   allows the wearer to travel through time. Daniel quickly learns how to
   use the Timebelt and makes a few short jumps into his own future. He
   meets an alternate version of himself, who goes by "Don," who
   accompanies him to a race-track where the pair make a fortune betting
   on horse-racing. The following day, Daniel realises that it is his turn
   to act as Don and guide his younger self through the previous day at
   the races; through this and other events the time-travelling Daniel
   learns more about the belt, about the nature of the "timestream," and
   about his personal identity.

   Daniel repeatedly encounters alternate versions of himself and enjoys
   his own company, ultimately having sex with himself and beginning a
   relationship with himself. He learns that the changes he has made to
   his timeline have erased all traces of his childhood and early life.
   Though he has been able to become closer to himself than he has in any
   other relationship, at some point he comes to find that he no longer
   meets other versions of himself. Lonely and hoping to correct the
   situation, he jumps many millennia backwards in time, where his jumps
   have not altered the timeline, and there he meets a female version of
   himself called Diane. Diane's future is a mirror of Daniel's - she was
   given the Timebelt by her Aunt Jane, and she had also begun a
   relationship with her other selves, called Donna. Daniel begins a
   relationship with Diane and Diane becomes pregnant. Daniel and Diane
   secretly desire a son and a daughter, respectively, and unbeknownst to
   each other jump and use future technology to make their own changes to
   ensure that Diane gives birth to the desired child. Shortly after the
   birth of their child, Daniel and Diane separate.

   Daniel raises his son in 1950s America. As Daniel ages, he misses the
   relationship he had with Diane, but the interference of an obsessive
   version of himself has erased the point in the past where the two can
   meet. He spends much of his time at a house party set in 1999, enjoying
   the company of dozens of versions of himself at different ages. At one
   point late in the party an elderly Daniel dies after a jump, and Daniel
   is consumed with the thought of his own inevitable death.

   Daniel eventually realizes that he has now become his Uncle Jim, and
   that his son will grow up to be the young version of himself who will
   inherit the Timebelt, and that his life has 'come full circle'. He
   makes preparations for after his death to ensure that the young Daniel
   experiences the same events that he did when he was the same age and
   have his own experience with time travel. The book ends with the young
   Daniel, who has read the now-complete diary, having to decide whether
   he will use the Timebelt.
