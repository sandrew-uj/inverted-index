   The novel opens with Snake coming to a nomadic tribe to treat a boy,
   Stavin, who has a tumor. While her cobra Mist manufactures an antidote
   in her venom glands, she leaves Grass, the dreamsnake, with Stavin to
   help him sleep.^[17] One of the nomads, Arevin, helps Snake control
   Mist as the cobra undergoes convulsions through the night, despite the
   terror that snakes hold for his people. She returns to Stavin in the
   morning to find that his parents have mortally wounded Grass, afraid he
   would hurt the boy. Despite her anger, she allows Mist to bite Stavin
   and inject the antidote. The leader of the nomads apologizes to Snake,
   and Arevin asks her to stay with them, but Snake explains that she
   needs a dreamsnake for her work and must return home and ask for a new
   one. She expresses fear that the other healers will take her snakes and
   cast her out instead. As she leaves, Arevin asks her to return
   someday.^[18]^[a]

   Snake stops at an oasis, where she is asked to help Jesse, a woman who
   has injured herself falling off a horse. Jesse's partner Merideth takes
   Snake to their camp, leaving Snake's baggage at the oasis. Snake finds
   that Jesse has broken her spine, leaving her paralyzed, something Snake
   cannot heal.^[19] Merideth and Alex, a third partner, convince Jesse
   that they should return to Center, where Jesse is from, in the hope
   that the off-worlders may be able to help her.^[20] Wandering around
   near the camp, Snake sees the body of Jesse's horse and realizes the
   area it fell is radioactive; Jesse had lain there long enough to have
   fatal radiation poisoning. Snake offers to let Mist bite Jesse and
   relieve her pain; Jesse accepts, and Merideth and Alex bid her
   farewell. Before she dies, Jesse tells Snake that her family is
   indebted to Snake and could help her get another dreamsnake from
   another planet.^[21]

   Returning to the oasis, Snake finds that someone has rifled through her
   belongings and stolen her journal. Grum, a caravan leader also camped
   there, says it was the work of a "crazy".^[22] Back among the nomads,
   Arevin decides to go after Snake.^[23] Snake crosses the Western desert
   to the town of Mountainside, where the mayor's son Gabriel asks her to
   heal the mayor.^[24] While staying with them, Snake invites Gabriel to
   sleep with her. After he expresses hesitation, she learns that he
   impregnated a friend as a result of being improperly taught
   "biocontrol", and that this led to a difficult relationship with his
   father.^[25] She tells him he can still learn, and suggests he find a
   different teacher when he leaves Mountainside, as he intends to
   do.^[25]

   While checking on her horses, Snake meets Melissa, a girl with a
   severely burned face who helps the stablemaster, who takes credit for
   her work.^[26] Her scars make her self-conscious of her appearance in a
   town of otherwise beautiful people.^[27] Shortly after, Snake is
   attacked on her way to the mayor's house by a man she assumes is the
   crazy.^[28] She discovers that Melissa has been physically and sexually
   abused by the stablemaster, and uses this knowledge to convince the
   mayor to free her. Melissa accompanies Snake as her adopted daughter
   when Snake leaves for Center.^[27] Snake explains to her that
   dreamsnakes are very rare, and that the healers have not found a way to
   make them breed.^[29] Meanwhile, Arevin arrives at the healer's
   dwelling north of Mountainside, but he is told that Snake isn't there,
   and goes south to find her.^[30] In Mountainside, he is briefly
   detained on suspicion of having been Snake's attacker, but is
   released.^[31]

   Snake and Melissa cross the eastern desert and reach Center, but are
   turned away, like every previous emissary from the healers.^[32] Soon
   after they return to the mountains, they are attacked again by the
   crazy, who demands the dreamsnake, and collapses when he learns the
   serpent is dead. Snake learns he is addicted to dreamsnake venom.^[33]
   Snake makes him take her to a community whose leader, North, possesses
   several dreamsnakes, and occasionally allows his followers to be bitten
   by them as a reward.^[34] The community lives in a "broken dome", a
   relic of a past civilization.^[35] North, who bears all healers a
   grudge, puts Snake in a large, cold pit filled with dreamsnakes.^[36]
   In the pit, Snake realizes that the intense cold brings dreamsnakes to
   maturity, and they breed in triplets, rather than the paired sexes of
   Earth.^[37] Her immunity to venom allows her to survive the pit, and
   eventually to climb out. While North's henchmen are in venom-induced
   comas, she finds Melissa similarly comatose, and escapes with her and a
   bag of dreamsnakes. She is met outside by Arevin, who helps Melissa
   recover.^[38]
