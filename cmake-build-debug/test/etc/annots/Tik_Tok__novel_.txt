   The title character is an intelligent robot (named after the mechanical
   man in the Oz books) who originally works as a domestic servant and
   house-painter. Unlike other robots, whose behavior is constrained by
   "asimov circuits"--a reference to Isaac Asimov's fictional Three Laws
   of Robotics, which require robots to protect and serve humans--Tik-Tok
   finds that he can do as he pleases, and he secretly commits various
   hideous crimes for his amusement. After manipulating both robots and
   humans to cause chaos and bloodshed, Tik-Tok becomes wealthy (partly
   through health care privatization) and is finally elected Vice
   President of the United States.
