   The first and last parts of the story are told as a third-person
   narrative, but the middle part is written in the first person. The
   story begins in 1861 with the faked death of President Olivero,
   dictator of the South American Republic of Roncador, who has staged his
   own assassination. He returns to his native England, to the village
   where he was born and raised. On the evening of his arrival, Olivero
   notices that the stream running through the village appears to be
   flowing backwards, and he decides to follow the water upstream to
   discover the cause.

   The stream's course leads Olivero to a mill, where through a lighted
   window he sees a woman tied to a chair, forced by the miller to drink
   the blood of a freshly slaughtered lamb. Instinctively, Olivero hurls
   himself through the open window, his "leap into the world of
   fantasy".^[14] The miller initially offers no resistance and allows
   Olivero to release the woman, whom he recognises by the colour of her
   skin to be Sally, one of the two green children who had mysteriously
   arrived in the village on the day he left, thirty years earlier;
   Olivero also recognises the miller as Kneeshaw, an ex-pupil at the
   village school where he had once taught. During a struggle between the
   two men Kneeshaw is accidentally drowned in the mill pond. The next
   morning Olivero and Sally continue on Olivero's quest to find the
   stream's destination, a pool in the moors high above the village.
   Paddling in its water, Sally begins to sink into the silvery sand
   covering its bed. Olivero rushes to her, and hand in hand they sink
   beneath the water of the pool.

   The book's second part recounts the events between Oliver leaving the
   village as its young schoolmaster and his return as ex-President
   Olivero. He travels to London initially, hoping to find employment as a
   writer, but after three years spent working as a bookkeeper in a
   tailor's shop he takes passage on a ship which lands him in Cadiz,
   Spain. Unable to speak the language, and in possession of a book by
   Voltaire, he is arrested as a suspected revolutionary. Held captive for
   two years, he learns Spanish from his fellow prisoners and determines
   to travel to one of the liberated American colonies he has learned of,
   where the possibility exists to establish a new world "free from the
   oppression and injustice of the old world".^[15]

   Freed in an amnesty following the death of King Ferdinand of Spain,
   Oliver makes his way to Buenos Aires. There he is mistaken for a
   revolutionary agent and taken to meet General Santos of the Roncador
   Army. Together they hatch a plot to seize the country's capital city
   and assassinate its dictator. The plot is successful and "Don Olivero"
   finds himself leader of the Assembly, making him the country's new
   dictator, a position he holds for 25 years. Eventually he realises that
   his style of government is leading the country into stagnation and
   "moral flaccidity";^[16] he begins to feel nostalgia for the English
   village where he was brought up, and resolves to escape. Wishing to
   avoid any suspicion that he is deserting Roncador, Olivero fakes his
   own assassination.

   The final part of the book continues the story from when Olivero and
   Sally disappear under the water. A large bubble forms around them,
   transporting them to the centre of the pool and ascending into a large
   grotto, from where they proceed on foot through a series of adjoining
   caverns. Sally tells Olivero that this is the country she and her
   brother left 30 years ago. Soon they encounter her people, to whom
   Sally, or Siloen as she is properly known, explains that many years ago
   she wandered off and became lost, but that she has now returned with
   one who "was lost too, and now wishes to dwell among us".^[17] Olivero
   and Siloen are welcomed into the community, where life is ordered
   around a progression from lower to upper ledges: the first ledge
   teaches the pleasures of youth; on the second ledge the pleasure of
   manual work is learned; on the third of opinion and argument; and
   finally, on the upper ledge, the "highest pleasure", of solitary
   thought.^[18]

   Olivero soon tires of the first ledge, and leaving Siloen behind he
   moves to the second, where he learns to cut and polish crystals, the
   most sacred of objects in this subterranean world. Eventually he is
   allowed to move to the highest ledge of all, "the final stage of
   life".^[19] There he is taught the "basic principles of the
   universe",^[20] that there is only Order and Disorder. "Order ... [is]
   the space-filling Mass about them ... Disorder is empty space".^[20]
   Disorder is caused by the senses, which, "being confined to the
   body ... create the illusion of self-hood".^[21] Olivero selects a
   grotto in which to spend what remains of his life alone, contemplating
   the "natural and absolute beauty" of the crystals he accepts from the
   crystal-cutters.^[22] Food and water is brought regularly, and he
   settles to the task of preparing his body for "the perfection of
   death",^[23] which when it comes he meets with a "peculiar joy".^[24]
   Removing Olivero's body from the grotto the attendants encounter
   another group carrying Siloen, who died at the same time as Olivero.
   The pair are laid together in a petrifying trough, to "become part of
   the same crystal harmony",^[24] as is customary when any of the Green
   people die.
