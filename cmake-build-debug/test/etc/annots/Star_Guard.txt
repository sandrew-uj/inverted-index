   Information given in the story indicates that Humanity only developed
   space travel far enough to attract the attention of Central Control in
   the 37th century AD. Norton explains the implied retardation of human
   development through references to nuclear wars, which presumably caused
   so much destruction that civilization took an extra sixteen or
   seventeen centuries to achieve a level of development suitable for
   resuming Humanity's reach for the stars.

   Presented in the guise of a history lecture at an alien university,
   Norton's introduction explains that in the 40th century the people of
   Terra (the Latin name having replaced the Anglo-Saxon Earth) can only
   go to the stars as mercenaries. On alien worlds Terrans fight brushfire
   wars and thereby help Central Control maintain peace within its vast
   interstellar empire. Archs, who fight with relatively primitive
   weapons, are organized into Hordes, which fight on underdeveloped
   barbarian planets, and Mechs, who fight with more modern weapons, are
   organized into Legions, which fight on advanced, civilized worlds. But
   then a Horde fighting on the medieval planet Fronn encounters a Legion
   of Mechs.
