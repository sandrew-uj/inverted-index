   The story of X-COM, set in the near-future at the time of the game's
   release, begins in the year 1998. The initial plot centers on increased
   reports of UFO sightings as tales of abductions and rumors of attacks
   by mysterious aliens become widespread. The nations of the world come
   to perceive this as a threat and attempt to form their own forces -
   such as Japan's Kiryu-Kai force - to deal with the crisis, but these
   efforts are unsuccessful. On December 11, 1998, representatives from
   some of the most powerful nations in the world secretly meet in Geneva
   to discuss the issue. From this meeting is born the clandestine defense
   and research organization Extraterrestrial Combat (X-COM), over which
   the player assumes control at the start of the game.

   In the beginning, the player will only have access to conventional
   weapons, but as the game progresses, the player learns more about the
   enemy, their species, mutated creations, and technology. It is
   ultimately revealed that the "leaders" behind the alien invasion are a
   race known as Ethereals which possess powerful mind control abilities
   and enslave other races of aliens to perform their bidding and that
   their main base in the Solar System is located in Cydonia region of
   Mars. The player must then prepare the final assault team, attack
   Cydonia and destroy the mastermind behind the alien invasion, the
   biocomputer Alien Brain.

   The game may end in several ways. If the player's performance is poor
   or worse for two consecutive months, the player runs a deep deficit for
   two consecutive months, all the player's bases are captured, or the
   player mounts an assault on the aliens' Mars base and loses, the game
   ends in defeat, where in the PlayStation version, the council of
   funding nations makes a futile attempt to negotiate with the aliens,
   who violently murder the negotiator. While in the MS-DOS version, the
   funding nations sign pacts with the aliens promising peace, but they
   instead destroy every city and poison the water and air to destroy any
   resistance, the remaining survivors are put in slave camps to help
   terraform Earth for future alien colonization. But If, however, the
   player is victorious in the final attack, the game ends in mankind's
   victory.
