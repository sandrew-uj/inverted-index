   Neverwhere is the story of Richard Mayhew and his trials and
   tribulations in London. At the start of the story, he is a young
   businessman, recently moved from Scotland and with a normal life ahead.
   This breaks, however, when he stops to help a mysterious young girl who
   appears before him, bleeding and weakened, as he walks with his fiancee
   to dinner to meet her influential boss.

   The morning after Richard rescues the girl, named Door, from the
   streets, she is greatly recovered and sends him to find the Marquis de
   Carabas, a man who will be able to help Door escape two infamous (and
   seemingly inhuman) assassins, the Messrs Croup and Vandemar. Richard
   brings the Marquis back to his apartment to meet Door, only to see both
   of them vanish immediately. Soon after, Richard begins to realise the
   consequences of his actions. He appears to have become invisible; he
   loses his job, where no one seems to recognise him, and his apartment
   is rented out to other people. His fiancee no longer recognizes him
   either.

   Determined to set things right, Richard tries to enter the world of
   London Below in search of Door. He finds a tramp from Below, who is the
   only person able to see him, and recites the name of the Floating
   Market as the only place known to him in underworld. The tramp brings
   Richard to the realm of the Rat-Speakers, who worship and perform tasks
   for rats. They attempt to assault and rob Richard, but follow orders
   from the master rat and let him free. He then travels across the
   mysterious Night's Bridge, whose darkness kills Richard's Rat-Speaker
   guide, Anaesthesia. Eventually he arrives at the Floating Market, where
   he meets again with Door, who is holding an audition for bodyguards.
   Going to the Market, a giant bazaar where people barter for all manner
   of junk and magical items, Richard realises that London Below is not
   such a bad place.

   The legendary bodyguard and fighter Hunter joins Richard, Door and the
   Marquis and the party set out for the Earl's Court. Door and the
   Marquis have previously travelled to Door's home and discovered a diary
   entry made by Door's father, which advises her to seek aid from the
   angel Islington. When the four reach the Earl's Court, on a mysterious
   underground train which follows its own bizarre schedule, the Marquis
   is forced to leave. This is due to an old grudge between himself and
   the Earl. The rest discover that they need to travel through the relic
   Angelus to reach Islington, and that the Angelus resides in the British
   Museum.

   Door and Richard travel to the Museum, while Hunter, due to a curse
   which prevents her from entering London Above, remains in the abandoned
   British Museum underground station. After some searching they find the
   Angelus, which Door "opens" using her family's Talent, and travel
   through it to the underground home of the angel. Islington explains
   that his position as protector of London Below is a punishment for the
   submersion of Atlantis, which was also under his care, and tells Door
   that he will help her learn the identity of those who killed her
   family, for a price. She and her company must retrieve a unique key
   from the Black Friars and bring it to the angel.

   The two return to the Museum and go below to reunite with Hunter. In
   the meantime, the Marquis seeks out Croup and Vandemar, exchanging a
   priceless Tang dynasty figurine for information regarding who ordered
   the murder of Door's family. The true price for this information,
   however, is his life; Croup and Vandemar capture, torture, and kill
   him, breaking the one-hour "head start" agreement that was part of
   their deal with the Marquis.

   Door, Richard, and Hunter proceed onward to the dwelling of the Black
   Friars. There, they are faced with a series of three ordeals; Hunter
   wins a test of strength, Door wins a test of intellect, and Richard,
   alone in history, wins a test of character. He is convinced his
   adventures Below had all been a hallucination, but a trinket from his
   now-dead friend Anaesthesia re-orients him. As a result, the three
   succeed in gaining the key. Richard's ordeal greatly changes him,
   causing him to lose most of his self-doubts; he is now confident enough
   to interact with other beings of London Below. The three then travel to
   the Floating Market, where they are unable to find the Marquis, but
   where Hammersmith, a blacksmith friend of Door's, is able to secretly
   forge a copy of the key won by Richard. Richard enlists the mysterious
   Lamia, one of the vampire-like Velvets, as a guide to lead them to the
   angel's residence.

   They travel on London Below's Down Street, toward Islington. Door,
   Richard, Lamia, and Hunter make their way down the long path of Down
   Street. Meanwhile, the Marquis's body is found on a Market and revived
   by Old Bailey, who uses the box containing the Marquis's life.
   Weakened, the Marquis sets out himself, following Door and company. On
   Down Street, it is discovered that Lamia was a dangerous choice for a
   guide, because the price she demands of Richard for her services is
   higher than he can pay and yet live, but the Marquis appears in time to
   save him.

   Hunter reveals she long ago was a traitor to Door's cause. She gives
   Door to Croup and Vandemar, in exchange for the magical spear she needs
   to hunt and slay the great Beast of London. Croup and Vandemar, with
   Door captive, travel downward, while Richard, the Marquis, and Hunter
   travel at a slower pace, all toward the great labyrinth through which
   they need to pass to reach Islington. In this labyrinth the Beast of
   London dwells. Hunter and Richard battle it, with Richard being the
   only survivor. Richard and the Marquis rush ahead, to the final
   confrontation between the parties, in which Islington's true nature is
   revealed. Islington is revealed to have ordered Croup and Vandemar to
   execute Door's family as revenge for Door's father's refusal to assist
   him. He also reveals he had also manipulated her father's diary in
   order to lure her to him. Islington wishes to use Door and the key to
   force open the door to Heaven, where he seeks dominion over all the
   other angels as revenge for his banishment. After Richard is tortured
   by Croup and Vandemar, Door agrees to open the door, but she uses the
   copy of the key Richard won. The key does not open the door to Heaven,
   but instead to somewhere else, as far away as she could imagine,
   presumably to Hell. Islington, Croup and Vandemar are all sucked
   through the gateway before Door closes it. Door then uses the Black
   Friars' real key to allow Richard to travel back to London Above, where
   he finds himself restored to his normal life as it was before he first
   met Door.

   After returning home, Richard is happy for a time, but he realises that
   his experiences have changed him, and that his old life and friends
   mean little to him now. He realises that he is not satisfied with the
   regular world, and wants to return to London Below but does not know
   how to do it. He draws the shape of a door with his knife (a dying gift
   from Hunter), but nothing happens so he despairs of returning and is
   feeling that he has ruined his life, but in the end the Marquis appears
   to provide a way back.
