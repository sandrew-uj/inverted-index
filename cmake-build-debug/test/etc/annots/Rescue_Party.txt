   The story begins with a ship full of aliens visiting Earth only hours
   before the Sun will explode, destroying the planet. The mission of the
   aliens is to try to save as many people and as much of the culture as
   possible. Normally the galactic civilization does surveys of planets
   every one million years for new species, but the human race did not
   exist the last time the survey was done - four hundred thousand years
   before. However, radio signals had been detected on a planet 200 light
   years away, indicating intelligent life had arisen.

   To the aliens' surprise, the planet seems to be empty of intelligent
   life, except for the remnants of a civilization. While the aliens
   explore the old cities, we find out that it is typical for species to
   take thousands of years to develop from radio to space travel.

   During their exploration of Earth, the aliens find a communication
   tower beaming into space. At the end of the story, they follow the beam
   and find an enormous fleet of human ships, powered by rockets. The
   aliens, equipped with faster-than-light ships, are amazed that humans
   dared to cross interstellar space with rockets, having done so only 200
   years after inventing radio. Humans do not possess faster-than-light
   ships, but in order to survive as a species have taken the audacious
   tactic of using generational starships, in the hopes that their
   descendants will one day arrive at a new planet.

   The final lines of the story have the aliens musing about the nature of
   human civilization and the future of the humans when they learn about
   the existence of other intelligent life, given their rapid advancement
   and apparent determination. The last sentence hints the outcome might
   not be favorable to the aliens.
