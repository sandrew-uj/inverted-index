   Journey to Mars the Wonderful World: Its Beauty and Splendor; Its
   Mighty Races and Kingdoms; Its Final Doom is an 1894 science fiction
   novel written by Gustavus W. Pope. (The author called his work a
   "scientific novel."^[1]) The book has attracted increased contemporary
   attention as a precedent and possible source for the famous Barsoom
   novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs.^[2]^[3]^[4] A sequel, Journey to Venus,
   followed in 1895.

   Pope's novel is the story of a Lt. Frederick Hamilton, USN. On a voyage
   to Antarctica, his ship is wrecked; he and a Maori sailor are cast onto
   a barren island. Though near the end of his endurance, Hamilton rescues
   a strange-looking man before he loses consciousness. He awakens three
   weeks later, aboard a spaceship traveling to Mars. (Hamilton at first
   does not realize his hosts are Martians; he suspects they might have
   come from within the Hollow Earth through a polar opening, as per John
   Symmes's theory. Pope also wrote a subterranean fiction novel.)

   On Pope's Mars there are three human-like races: red, yellow, and blue
   Martians. They have attained a sophisticated technology while
   preserving a feudal society (which allows for duels and swordplay),
   much as in Burroughs's later books. The Martians travel in "ethervolt
   cars" and anti-gravity aircraft; they enjoy communications devices that
   are equivalent to television and video telephone. Pope also provides a
   Martian magician who is telepathic, invokes spirits, and reads the
   hero's future.

   Hamilton has various adventures, including a romance with the
   yellow-complexioned Princess Suhlamia. The Martians need to relocate
   from their world because of impending planetary catastrophe: meteors
   bombard the planet (the so-called Martian canals are actually linear
   cities, which makes them thinner targets), and the moons Phobos and
   Deimos threaten to crash to the surface. Hamilton returns to Earth to
   try to find space for them. A Martian revolution disrupts his plans,
   however; he writes no account of his adventures prior to an attempt to
   return to the red planet.

   Gustavus W. Pope (1828-1902) was a physician based in Washington DC,
   who wrote several books on a range of subjects (including one on
   Shakespeare's supposed Roman Catholicism). Pope followed his Journey to
   Mars with Journey to Venus the Primeval World; Its Wondrous Creations
   and Gigantic Monsters (1895), in which Hamilton and Suhlamia visit that
   planet.

   Journey to Mars has been reprinted in two modern editions, from
   Hyperion Press in 1974 and from Wildside Press in 2008. The Hyperion
   edition features an Introduction by Sam Moskowitz.
