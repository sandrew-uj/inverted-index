   After discovering that the world was not covered by catastrophic plague
   or poisonous yellow dust, telepathic twins Mika and Ellie realized that
   the government lied to the population. The governing elite wanted the
   people to believe this so that the rich could live in luxury on the
   southern side of the Wall while the most of the rest of the people
   starved in cramped conditions in the north.

   Mal Gorman, a man who has avoided death for many years, controls the
   north and has an army of mutated children. He plans to break down the
   Wall and start a war against the south, but the children realize that
   this will have disastrous consequences. The twins join his army to work
   against him from the inside.
