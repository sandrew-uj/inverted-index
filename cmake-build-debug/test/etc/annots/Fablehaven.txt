   The series begins as 13-year-old Kendra and 11-year-old Seth Sorenson
   are traveling to their Grandpa and Grandma Sorenson's house while their
   parents are away on a 17-day cruise. When they get there, they also
   meet Dale, the groundskeeper, and Lena, the housekeeper. Grandma
   Sorenson is "mysteriously" missing. Grandpa Sorenson does not tell
   Kendra and Seth about Fablehaven being a secret preserve for magical
   creatures at first, but instead sets up a rather complex puzzle
   involving six keys and a locked journal for Kendra to solve. Once
   Kendra unlocks the mostly blank journal, she discovers the words "Drink
   the milk". She and Seth drink the magical milk opening their eyes to a
   whole new, mystical world full of the magical beings of Fablehaven.
   Then Kendra and Seth must face challenges such as defeating an evil
   witch and a powerful demon, defending the preserve from an evil
   society, stopping a plague that changes creatures of light into
   creatures of darkness, and ultimately, protecting the world from a
   horde of imprisoned demons.
