   Dagny Taggart, the operating vice-president of Taggart Transcontinental
   railroad, keeps the company going amid a sustained economic depression.
   As economic conditions worsen and government enforces statist controls
   on successful businesses, people are heard repeating the cryptic phrase
   "Who is John Galt?" which means: "Don't ask questions nobody can
   answer";^[6] or more broadly, "Why bother?". Her brother Jim, the
   railroad's president, seems to make irrational decisions, such as
   buying from Orren Boyle's unreliable Associated Steel. Dagny is also
   disappointed to discover that the Argentine billionaire Francisco
   d'Anconia, her childhood friend and first love, is risking his family's
   copper company by constructing the San Sebastian copper mines, even
   though Mexico will probably nationalize them. Despite the risk, Jim and
   Boyle invest heavily in a railway for the region while ignoring the Rio
   Norte Line in Colorado, where entrepreneur Ellis Wyatt has discovered
   large oil reserves. Mexico nationalizes the mines and railroad line,
   but the mines are discovered to be worthless. To recoup the railroad's
   losses, Jim influences the National Alliance of Railroads to prohibit
   competition in prosperous areas such as Colorado. Wyatt demands that
   Dagny supply adequate rails to his wells before the ruling takes
   effect.

   In Philadelphia, self-made steel magnate Hank Rearden develops Rearden
   Metal, an alloy lighter and stronger than conventional steel. Dagny
   opts to use Rearden Metal in the Rio Norte Line, becoming the first
   major customer for the product. After Hank refuses to sell the metal to
   the State Science Institute, a government research foundation run by
   Dr. Robert Stadler, the Institute publishes a report condemning the
   metal without identifying problems with it. As a result, many
   significant organizations boycott the line. Although Stadler agrees
   with Dagny's complaints about the unscientific tone of the report, he
   refuses to override it. To protect Taggart Transcontinental from the
   boycott, Dagny decides to build the Rio Norte Line as an independent
   company named the John Galt Line.

   Hank is unhappy with his manipulative wife Lillian, but feels obliged
   to stay with her. He is attracted to Dagny, and when he joins her for
   the successful inauguration of the John Galt Line, they become lovers.
   On a vacation trip, Hank and Dagny discover an abandoned factory with
   an incomplete but revolutionary motor that runs on atmospheric static
   electricity. They begin searching for the inventor, and Dagny hires
   scientist Quentin Daniels to reconstruct the motor. However, a series
   of economically harmful directives are issued by Wesley Mouch, a former
   Rearden lobbyist who betrayed Hank in return for a job leading a
   government agency. In response, Wyatt sets his wells on fire and
   disappears. Several other important business leaders have disappeared,
   leaving their industries to failure.

   From conversations with Francisco, Dagny and Hank realize he is hurting
   his copper company intentionally, although they do not understand why.
   When the government imposes a directive that forbids employees from
   leaving their jobs and nationalizes all patents, Dagny violates the law
   by resigning in protest. To gain Hank's compliance, the government
   blackmails him with threats to publicize his affair with Dagny. After a
   major disaster in one of Taggart Transcontinental's tunnels, Dagny
   returns to work. On her return, she receives notice that Quentin
   Daniels is also quitting in protest, and she rushes across the country
   to convince him to stay.

   On her way to Daniels, Dagny meets a hobo with a story that reveals the
   secret of the motor: it was invented and abandoned by an engineer named
   John Galt, who is the inspiration for the common saying. When she
   chases after Daniels in a private plane, she crashes and discovers the
   secret behind the disappearances of business leaders: Galt is leading
   an organized strike of "the men of the mind" against a society that
   demands that they be sacrificed. She has crashed in their hiding place,
   an isolated valley known as Galt's Gulch. As she recovers from her
   injuries, she hears the strikers' explanations for the strike, and
   learns that the strikers include Francisco and many prominent people,
   such as her favorite composer, Richard Halley, and infamous pirate
   Ragnar Danneskjoeld. Dagny falls in love with Galt, who asks her to
   join the strike.

   Reluctant to abandon her railroad, Dagny leaves Galt's Gulch, but finds
   the government has devolved into dictatorship. Francisco finishes
   sabotaging his mines and quits. After he helps stop an armed takeover
   of Hank's steel mill, Francisco convinces Hank to join the strike. Galt
   follows Dagny to New York, where he hacks into a national radio
   broadcast to deliver a three-hour speech that explains the novel's
   theme and Rand's Objectivism.^[7] The authorities capture Galt, but he
   is rescued by his partisans. The government collapses, and the novel
   closes as Galt announces that the way is clear for the strikers to
   rejoin the world.
