   The main story arc charts the adventures of fifteen-year-old American
   twins, named Sophie and Josh Newman, whose regular lives working at
   their summer jobs (Sophie works in a coffee shop, Josh in a bookstore)
   are turned upside down by the arrival of Dr. John Dee. Dr. Dee engages
   the bookstore owner, Nick Fleming, in a battle of magic in an attempt
   to steal an ancient book, The Book of Abraham the Mage (a.k.a. the
   Codex) from him. Dr. John Dee snatches the book from Josh's grasp, but
   Josh manages to retain two pages. Dr. John Dee also kidnaps Nick's wife
   Perry Fleming and imprisons her on Alcatraz Island.

   After the battle, Nick Fleming confesses to Josh and Sophie that his
   real name is Nicholas Flamel, that he is the French alchemist from
   history, that he is also immortal, and that the twins, himself, and
   Perry (his immortal wife, Perenelle Flamel), are in grave danger.
   Nicholas tells the twins that he believes them to be mentioned in a
   prophecy within the Codex, and that the fate of the world as they know
   it could depend on his success in getting their dormant, latent magical
   abilities fully awakened. He also tells them that without the Codex,
   both he and Perry will die within a month, as their immortality,
   prolonged youth, and longevity depend on a recipe for a special elixir
   found only within its pages. This elixir changes monthly and cannot be
   memorised.

   Meanwhile, Dr. John Dee has found out that he is missing two vital
   pages from the Codex. The pages are the Final Summoning, needed by him
   to return his masters, the Dark Elders, to earth... and so begins a
   fast-paced race as Dee pursues the twins and Nicholas for the pages of
   the Codex, whilst Nicholas, aided by Scathach and others, race to get
   the twins' latent magical auras awakened, to get them schooled in the
   use of the elemental magics - Water, Fire, Earth, Air, and Aether - and
   to rescue his wife, Perry.

   The stories criss-cross the globe, featuring well-known places and
   sights, such as San Francisco, London, the Eiffel Tower, Stonehenge,
   and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many characters from history and mythology
   help both sides pursue their goals. In the first four books alone,
   Scathach, Hekate, Prometheus, the Witch of Endor, Gilgamesh, Niccolo
   Machiavelli, Bastet, Odin, William Shakespeare, Joan of Arc, Billy the
   Kid, Virginia Dare, the Count of St. Germain, and Mars Ultor enter the
   series.
