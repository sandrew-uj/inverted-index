   Distress describes the political intrigue surrounding a
   mid-twenty-first century physics conference, at which is to be
   presented a unified Theory of Everything. In the background of the
   story is an epidemic mental illness, related in some way to the
   imminent discovery of the TOE. The action takes place on an artificial
   island called "Stateless", which has earned the wrath of the world's
   large biotech companies for its pilfering of their intellectual
   property.

   The narrator is a journalist for a science channel called SeeNet named
   Andrew Worth who carries video recording software in an intestinal
   implant. He is offered a story on a new illness called Distress, but
   declines. He journeys to Stateless through a series of convoluted
   flights to cover a presentation by 27-year-old South African physicist
   Violet Mosala, supplanting the preproduction by a colleague, Sarah
   Knight. When he arrives, he is informed by an asex anthrocosmologist
   named Akili that Violet's life is in danger. Violet is finishing her
   Theory of Everything, which she intends to present on the conference's
   last day.

   Through interfacing with a talkative local, Worth learns that Violet
   plans to emigrate to Stateless after the conference to use her
   celebrity to provide an opportunity for South Africa and other nations
   to end their support for the United Nations boycott of Stateless. He
   also witnesses the islands' physical underpinnings: it is basically
   held up by the activity of millions of micro-organisms. After meeting
   with a faction of anthrocosmologists, he learns that they believe in
   the concept that the universe is created by one person's Theory of
   Everything. That person is called the Keystone.

   Worth becomes deathly ill and believes he has been infected with
   cholera by a faction of anthrocosmologists who wanted him to transmit
   the disease to Violet Mosala. He recovers and is kidnapped by this
   group, who are led by a rival physicist Worth saw with Violet at the
   conference. Worth and Akili are held on a tanker where it is explained
   that these cultists believe Violet's TOE will destroy the world. Worth
   signals for help by connecting his implant to a port on the ship. He
   and Akili are rescued by citizens of Stateless.

   Worth returns to the conference and learns that a biotech conglomerate
   sent a militia to Stateless, angry at the technology they have
   appropriated. He negotiates with the militia to let a suddenly ill
   Violet return to South Africa, where she dies. Before her illness,
   however, she tasked an AI to synthesize her final theory. The militia
   moves to take over the main city of Stateless, brutalizing the citizens
   as they evacuate to the outskirts. While seemingly helpless to do
   anything at first, they soon strike back at the invaders by having
   triggered microorganisms consume the cities structural underpinning,
   sinking it into the ocean. Worth is fired from SeeNet and Sarah Knight
   replaces him, covering the war. Worth discovers that Sarah was working
   with the cultists, and that AIs are exhibiting symptoms of the titular
   mental illness as well. Believing that the AI that wrote the paper
   became the Keystone and that Distress will continue until a human reads
   it, Worth downloads and reads the paper, and realizes that all minds,
   together, collaborate in being "the" Keystone, giving all of humanity
   an intuitive connection with the universe.
