   Former Episcopal priest Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on an isolated
   farm in Doylestown, Pennsylvania with his asthmatic preteen son Morgan
   (Rory Culkin) and younger daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin). Graham's
   younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed minor-league
   baseball player, has been living on the farm to help out since Graham's
   wife Colleen died in a traffic accident six months earlier, shown in a
   series of flashbacks. Graham has since lost his religious faith and
   abandoned the church.

   Large crop circles appear in the Hess' cornfield that are initially
   attributed to vandals. Soon after, other crop circles, eventually
   determined to be navigational guides, appear globally, and lights from
   invisible objects hover over Mexico and other cities later on. One
   night, Graham and Merrill chase a tall dark figure that disappears into
   the field. Graham later glimpses another one among the corn stalks, and
   strange clicking noises are heard over Bo's old baby monitor. In
   Brazil, an alien is filmed during a child's birthday party.

   Ray Reddy (M. Night Shyamalan), the man responsible for Colleen's fatal
   accident, calls the Hess house but hangs up. Graham goes to
   investigate, finding Reddy sitting inside his car. Reddy expresses
   remorse for Colleen's death and Graham losing his faith. As he is about
   to drive to a lake, believing the aliens avoid water, Reddy warns
   Graham that a creature is locked inside his pantry. Graham
   investigates, using a large kitchen knife to peer under the pantry
   door. As he is about to leave he thinks twice and goes back to try and
   get a better look. The alien reaches under the door to try and attack
   him, but Graham cuts off the end of several of its fingers with the
   knife.

   As a worldwide alien invasion begins, the Hesses barricade themselves
   inside their house. As several aliens break into the house, the family
   retreats to the basement. Morgan has an asthma attack but survives the
   night, despite being without his medication. The family emerge the next
   morning after radio reports say the aliens have abruptly abandoned
   Earth, stranding some aliens. The alien which had been trapped inside
   Ray Reddy's pantry, identified by its missing fingertips, enters the
   house and takes Morgan hostage. Recalling Colleen's dying words, Graham
   tells Merrill to "swing away", using his baseball bat. The alien sprays
   Morgan with a toxic gas from its wrist. Graham recovers his stricken
   son as Merrill bashes the creature, hitting it into glasses of water
   left by Bo, the liquid scalding its skin. Merrill continues hitting the
   creature, eventually killing it. Outside, Morgan revives after Graham
   administers his medication. Morgan's constricted lungs prevented him
   inhaling the alien's toxins, an act Graham attributes to the
   intervention from a higher power.

   Months later, the Hess family has recovered from the ordeal. In the
   final scene, Graham is seen as having returned to the church, his faith
   restored.
