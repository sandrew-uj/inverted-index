   In 1853, Genta Nishiyama begins preaching the prophecies of Michel de
   Nostradame using a copy of his book Centuries. When Nishiyama is
   executed by the Tokugawa Shogunate for supposed heresy (after
   discussing the arrival of "black ships" that will end Japan's long
   isolation), his wife and son flee with the book in hand, passing down
   the knowledge to future generations. At the onset of World War II, his
   descendant, Gengaku, is interrogated by an Imperial Japanese Army
   officer about the family's continued preaching of the prophecies, which
   predicted the rise of Nazism and the defeat of the Axis
   powers.

   In the present day of 1999, biologist Dr. Ryogen Nishiyama is called in
   to analyze recent scientific phenomena, such as the appearance of large
   mutant slugs, children wielding advanced abilities after drinking water
   near a zinc mine, and large ice packs just north of Hawaii. He is also
   a leading figure in the fight against environmental pollution, natural
   disasters, and the global arms race. The U.N. sends a research
   expedition to New Guinea to investigate a radioactive dust cloud that
   appeared over the island, but the team suddenly goes out of all
   contact. Nishiyama joins a second team to find them and discover that
   the area around the team's last known position is now infested by large
   mutant bats and leeches; one leech renders a team member unconscious
   and he later turns violently insane after the team sets up camp. He is
   sedated, but is later feasted on by cannibals. The team fight off the
   cannibals and chase them into a cave, where they find the remains of
   the original group, but are disheartened that some of them are barely
   alive; they are forced to kill and bury the survivors.

   A SST jet explodes in the atmosphere over Japan, with the explosion
   puncturing the ozone layer and unleashing ultraviolet radiation below.
   The polar icecaps melt, triggering massive floods in Japan. After more
   natural disasters hit the country, the civilian populace turns to
   looting as rationing takes effect. Society breaks down further, with
   several people committing suicide. The panic escalates until nuclear
   war breaks out, devastating humanity. Most of the survivors are left
   mutated, and fight each other for food among the ruins of civilization.

   It is revealed that the nuclear war is one of many nightmare scenarios
   Nishiyama is explaining before the Japanese Cabinet. As the prime
   minister explains a resolve to find a solution, Nishiyama, his daughter
   Mariko, and her boyfriend Akira (a globetrotting photographer) leave
   the Diet building.
