   The main character Noah Daniels, his family and other survivors who
   live in an underground colony called North Col in the year 2020. It is
   impossible to live on the planet's surface, because of the extreme cold
   and constant snow storms caused by the impact of a comet known as
   Nemesis. As all animal life was destroyed by the comet's strike, the
   children are taught about these extinct animals with the aid of a
   holodeck. As a side effect of the holodeck, Noah finds himself
   transported into the future, into a place called Haven, where a group
   of children known as the Nomads battle the evil Tao and his men, The
   Protectors, for control of a valuable blue mineral called thunderstone.

   Thunderstone is the name given to the chemical compound of which the
   Nemesis comet was made. It is a source of energy and power, and can be
   used to do anything from making explosives to allowing vehicles to run
   on it like gas. It also reacts violently when it comes into contact
   with itself, causing it to disintegrate if enough impact is made. When
   drunk as a compounded solution, it grants long life to the drinker.
   Much of the plot revolves around attempts to control the supplies of
   thunderstone due to its many useful properties.
