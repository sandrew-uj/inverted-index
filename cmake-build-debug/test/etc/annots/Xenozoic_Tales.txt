   In the storyline, Earth has been ravaged by pollution and natural
   disasters of all sorts. To escape this, humanity built vast underground
   cities in which they lived for approximately 500 years. Upon emerging,
   the humans found that the world had been reclaimed by previously
   extinct lifeforms (most spectacularly, dinosaurs). In the new
   'Xenozoic' era, technology is extremely limited and those with
   mechanical skills command a great deal of respect and influence.

   The two main characters of the series are mechanic Jack Tenrec and
   scientist and love interest, Hannah Dundee. Tenrec operates a garage in
   which he restores cars, particularly Cadillacs. Given that the
   post-apocalyptic world no longer possesses the ability to refine oil,
   Tenrec modifies his cars to run on dinosaur guano. These cars, of
   course, are frequently chased by rampaging dinosaurs in pulp style
   action-adventure stories.

   Other characters include various criminals, politicians, scientists,
   and inventors who populate the dystopian world of tomorrow. There is
   also a race of reptilian humanoids called the Grith who cannot speak in
   a human language but instead communicate by spelling words with
   Scrabble tiles. These creatures have befriended Tenrec, and apparently
   have the ability to communicate telepathically with the dinosaurs.
   Added into the mix is Hermes, an Allosaurus Jack raised, and who
   basically acts as the most threatening guard dog one could ask for.
