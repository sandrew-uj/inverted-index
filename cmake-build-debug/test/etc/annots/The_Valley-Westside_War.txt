   In The Valley-Westside War, a global nuclear war broke out between the
   United States and the Soviet Union in 1967, leading to the collapse of
   civilization. The book is set in the ruins in what was once Los
   Angeles, 130 years after the war. The area of the city is controlled by
   two rival feudal states at war with one another: the Kingdom of
   Westside and the Kingdom of the Valley. The Crosstime Traffic team is
   dispatched to investigate the remains of the UCLA library in an attempt
   to discover what happened to cause the initial nuclear war, but are
   caught up in the local war by citizens of both kingdoms who believe
   that they are trying to access the knowledge of the old people to
   create advanced weapons.
