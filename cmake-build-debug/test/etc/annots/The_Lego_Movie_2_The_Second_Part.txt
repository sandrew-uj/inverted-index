   Shortly after the invasion led by Lord Business in which Emmet destroys
   the Kragle using the Piece of Resistance, Duplo aliens arrive in the
   Lego universe and threaten destruction. Emmet builds the aliens a
   heart as a token of friendship, but one eats it and demands more. Lucy
   and the Master Builders believe this is an attack and retaliate, and
   the ensuing battle ravages Bricksburg. During the insanity, President
   Business builds a golf cart and abandons the group to play golf.

   Five years later, the teenaged Finn has rebuilt Bricksburg as
   "Apocalypseburg". Within the Lego universe, they have been ravaged by
   repeated Duplo attacks, and several of their friends have gone missing
   in a search for the Duplo home planet. Emmet remains upbeat in stark
   contrast to Lucy and his friends, though he is troubled by visions of
   an imminent disaster he calls "armamageddon". A mini-doll called
   General Sweet Mayhem arrives and kidnaps all of Emmet's friends, taking
   them to the shape-shifting empress of the "Systar System", Queen
   Watevera Wa'Nabi. Wa'Nabi who can seemingly brainwash Emmet's friends
   into accepting the joy of her world, and convinces Batman to marry her
   as a way to unite the Lego and Duplo worlds, but Lucy alone remains
   highly skeptical of her endgame.

   Back in Apocalypseburg, Emmet tries to convince the Master Builders to
   help him save Lucy and the rest of his friends, but they refuse to
   help, believing that he isn't tough enough to go through the Systar
   System. Emmet subsequently crafts a spaceship to pursue Mayhem by
   passing through the "Stairgate". The ship is heavily damaged and nearly
   collides with an asteroid field, but is saved in time by rugged
   adventurer Rex Dangervest. After hearing Emmet's story, Rex offers to
   help and takes them to the Systar System, and en route, Emmet tries to
   emulate some of Rex's mannerisms in an attempt to be tough. When they
   arrive, they quickly reunite with Lucy and learn of the marriage plans,
   which Rex insists must be a front to bring on "armamageddon".

   As the wedding starts, Emmet, Rex, and Lucy split up to sabotage the
   event. However, Lucy is intercepted by Mayhem, who insists the wedding
   is instead supposed to prevent "armamageddon". At the ceremony, Wa'Nabi
   reveals her true form: the heart that Emmett tried to give the Duplo
   invaders five years prior. Realizing that Mayhem is right, Lucy tries
   to stop Emmet, but Emmet, who now truly believes she is brainwashed,
   refuses, and destroys the wedding. In reality, Finn, after finding that
   his younger sister Bianca had taken his Lego figures, has smashed her
   own creations. Emmet realizes his mistake, but is seized by Rex, who
   reveals he is a version of Emmet from the future. Rex had collided with
   the asteroids, and ended up under the dryer, forgotten by Finn. To
   ensure his future existence, he changed his appearance and created a
   time-travel machine to return to help Emmet but to make sure
   "armamageddon" came to pass. When Emmet tries to fight back, Rex knocks
   him under the same dryer, ensuring that he would continue to exist and
   Rex later came to the Dryer System and kicks Emmet and Emmet trys to
   get up but falls to the ground. In the real world, Finn and Bianca's
   mother is fed up with the kids' bickering, and orders them to put the
   Lego toys into the storage bin; Lucy recognizes this as Emmet's
   "armamageddon" (as in "our mama gets in"). Both the Lego and Duplo
   figures are put into the "Bin of Storajj" and fear they will not
   escape.

   While every Lego and Duplo figure sings about the awful situation they
   are now, Lucy, who refused to give up, sings to encourage everyone not
   to give up too. Finn hears the song from the Bin and opens it and sees
   Wa'Nabi in pieces, thinking of the day he gave the heart to Bianca when
   they were young. Finn rebuilds the heart, reconciles with her and start
   playing together. In the Lego universe, Lucy and the others escape the
   Bin and help rebuild both Apocalypseburg and Wa'Nabi's world and they
   took off to save Emmet and stop Rex Emmet was already fighting Rex when
   Rex attacks Emmet and Rex's Dino Troops come to attack Lucy and the
   others but they fought back as Lucy jumps off the ship as Rex had
   breaks Emmet in half. Lucy arrived and save Emmet and defeat Rex and
   destroys his time machine. Emmet vows that he will never become
   over-tough like Rex, and with this self-realization, a remorseful Rex
   is erased from existence, correcting a time paradox in reality.

   Finn and Bianca's mother sees them playing together, and has a change
   of heart. The Lego universe is recreated as a mish-mash of the newly
   made Bricksburg and the Systar System, renamed "Syspocalypstar".
   President Business returns to congratulate Emmet and Lucy on their hard
   work, but his hair is set on fire by Benny and causes him to run into a
   Fireworks store, where he is blown away. Emmet's home is rebuilt, and
   the film ends with Lucy making Emmet a gift of the original album of
   "Everything Is Awesome", revealing that she co-originated the song,
   causing Emmet and Unikitty to gasp in shock and excitement.
