   After the death of his wife and child, Prince Ronan falls into a
   depression so deep that even a fated encounter with the witch Brume
   leaves him unmoved. He gives Brume his heart, certain that he no longer
   needs whatever is left of it, and then wanders through the forests of
   his country, escaping from an arranged marriage that his parents hope
   to force him into. In the woods he becomes enchanted by a firebird and
   relentlessly pursues it, leaving behind his memories in his madness.

   As her betrothed runs wildly through the wilderness, Princess Sidonie
   reluctantly leaves her home of Dacia to travel Serre. Her father and
   his wizard Unciel realize that an alliance between Dacia and Serre will
   protect their country from war. To aid Sidonie and guard her from
   Serre's magic, Unciel arranges another wizard, Gyre, to escort her
   while Unciel, who is still weak from an earlier battle, and his scribe
   Euan Ash watch over the events from Dacia. Gyre agrees, but has his own
   motivation for undertaking the journey. Sidonie encounters the nearly
   delirious Ronan, though neither know who the other is; Gyre, aware of
   the prince's quest, takes advantage of the confused situation to steal
   Ronan's identity.

   With the help of Unciel, who gathers his strength to settle the
   unfinished business he has with Gyre, Sidonie brings Ronan back from
   his wanderings and brings peace to both Serre and Dacia.
