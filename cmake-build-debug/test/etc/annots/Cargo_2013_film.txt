   After a car crash knocks him unconscious, a man wakes up to find that
   his wife has died and turned into a zombie. He leaves the car, grabs
   his young daughter from the back seat, and realizes that his wife bit
   him while he was unconscious. After an emotional goodbye to his wife,
   he sets off to find survivors.

   Knowing that he does not have much time left before he turns into a
   zombie, he puts his daughter in a baby back-pack, binds his hands to a
   pole, and attaches carrion to the end of the pole. After he collapses,
   he rises again as a zombie, and, drawn by the lure of the carrion on
   the pole, continues his journey.

   After a point, he notices the balloon he inflated for his daughter and
   is distracted by it. He is then shot by a sniper, and a group of
   survivors investigate his corpse, almost leaving before one of them
   discovers his daughter, who has 'My Name is Rosie' written on her
   stomach in permanent marker.
