   The novel centers on a wealthy family living in New Rochelle, New York,
   referred to as Father, Mother, Mother's Younger Brother, Grandfather,
   and 'the little boy', Father and Mother's young son. The family
   business is the manufacture of flags and fireworks, an easy source of
   wealth due to the national enthusiasm for patriotic displays. Father
   joins Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole, and his return sees
   a change in his relationship with his wife, who has experienced
   independence in his absence. Mother's Younger Brother is a genius at
   explosives and fireworks but is an insecure, unhappy character who
   chases after love and excitement. He becomes obsessed with the
   notorious socialite Evelyn Nesbit, stalking her and embarking on a
   brief, unsatisfactory affair with her.

   Into this insecure setup comes an abandoned black child, then his
   severely depressed mother, Sarah. Coalhouse Walker, the child's father,
   visits regularly to win Sarah's affections. A professional musician,
   well dressed and well spoken, he gains the family's respect and
   overcomes their prejudice initially by playing ragtime music on their
   piano. Things go well until he is humiliated by a racist fire crew, led
   by Will Conklin, who vandalize his Model T Ford. He begins a pursuit of
   redress by legal action but discovers he cannot hope to win because of
   the inherent prejudice of the system. Sarah is killed in an attempt to
   aid him, and Coalhouse uses the money he was saving for their wedding
   to pay for an extravagant funeral.

   Having exhausted legal resources, Coalhouse begins killing firemen and
   bombing firehouses to force the city to meet his demands: that his
   Model T be restored to its original condition and Conklin be turned
   over to him for justice. Mother unofficially adopts Sarah and
   Coalhouse's neglected child over Father's objections, putting strain on
   their marriage. With a group of angry young men, all of whom refer to
   themselves as "Coalhouse Walker", Coalhouse continues his vigilante
   campaign and is joined by Younger Brother, who brings his knowledge of
   explosives. Coalhouse and his gang storm the Morgan Library, taking the
   priceless collection hostage and wiring the building with dynamite.
   Father is drawn into the escalating conflict as a mediator, as is
   Booker T. Washington. Coalhouse agrees to exchange Conklin's life for
   safe passage for his men, who leave in his restored Model T. Coalhouse
   is then shot as he surrenders to the authorities.

   Interwoven with this story is a depiction of life in the tenement slums
   of New York city, focused on an Eastern European immigrant referred to
   as Tateh, who struggles to support himself and his daughter after
   driving her mother off for accepting money for sex with her employer.
   The girl's beauty attracts the attention of Evelyn Nesbit, who provides
   financial support. When Tateh learns Nesbit's identity, however, he
   takes his daughter out of the city.

   Tateh is a talented artist and earns a living cutting out novelty paper
   silhouettes on the street. He tries working in a factory, where he
   experiences a successful workers' strike, but becomes disillusioned
   when he sees it change little about the workers' lives, although in the
   final chapter he still describes himself as a socialist. He starts
   making and selling moving picture books to a novelty toy company,
   becoming a pioneer of animation in the motion picture industry. Tateh
   becomes wealthy and styles himself "the Baron" in order to move more
   easily through high society. He meets and falls in love with Mother,
   who marries him after Father is killed in the sinking of the RMS
   Lusitania. They adopt each other's children, as well as Coalhouse's
   son, and move to California.
