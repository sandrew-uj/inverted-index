   Killy, a silent loner possessing an incredibly powerful weapon known as
   a Gravitational Beam Emitter, wanders a vast technological world known
   as "The City". He is searching for Net Terminal Genes, a (possibly)
   extinct genetic marker that allows humans to access the "Netsphere", a
   sort of computerized control network for The City. The City is an
   immense volume of artificial structure, separated into massive "floors"
   by nearly-impenetrable barriers known as "Megastructure". The City is
   inhabited by scattered human and transhuman tribes as well as hostile
   cyborgs known as Silicon Creatures. The Net Terminal Genes appear to be
   the key to halting the unhindered, chaotic expansion of the
   Megastructure, as well as a way of stopping the murderous robot horde
   known as the Safeguard from destroying all of humanity.

   Along the way, Killy meets and joins forces with a resourceful engineer
   named Cibo. Their quest is indirectly supported by the City's
   Authority, which is unable to stop the Safeguard from opposing them.
   Together, Killy and Cibo meet a young girl named Sanakan and a tribe of
   human warriors called the Electro-Fishers. The Electro-Fishers restore
   Killy's ability to visually scan things including genomes, revealing
   that Sanakan is a disguised Safeguard, who then attacks. Killy and Cibo
   defend the Electro-Fishers by bringing them to the cylindrical
   megastructure of Toha Heavy Industries. Here they meet Mensab, an AI
   independent from the Administration, and her guardian Seu, a human. The
   megastructure is ultimately destroyed due to attacks by Silicon Life
   and Sanakan, but Mensab is able to give Cibo a sample of Seu's DNA.

   Killy and Cibo next come to a region of the City ruled by a group of
   Silicon Life, where they ally with a pair of "provisional Safeguards"
   named Dhomochevsky and Iko. Seu's DNA is stolen by the Silicon leader,
   Davine, who uses it to access the Netsphere. Dhomochevsky sacrifices
   his life to kill Davine, but not before they download an extremely
   powerful Level 9 Safeguard from the Netsphere which manifests in Cibo's
   body. The Cibo Safeguard destroys the entire region.

   14 years later, Killy's body repairs itself from the attack and he
   continues his journey. He discovers that Cibo, having lost her memory,
   was eventually rescued by Sanakan, who is now allied with the Authority
   against the rest of the Safeguard. Cibo's body is incubating a "sphere"
   which contains her genetic information. Ultimately, Cibo and Sanakan
   both die in a final confrontation with the Safeguard, but Killy
   survives and preserves the sphere. An AI he previously met whose body
   was destroyed is seen in a virtual reality, recalling his quest an
   unknown amount of time later. Killy finally reaches the edge of the
   City, where he is shot in the head and incapacitated, but a flood of
   water carries him to a vast ocean-like space where the sphere begins to
   hatch. In the final page, Killy is seen fighting in the corridors of
   the City again, now accompanied by a small child wearing a hazmat suit.
