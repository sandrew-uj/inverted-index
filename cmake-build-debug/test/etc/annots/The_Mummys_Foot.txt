   A man enters an antiques shop and buys a mummified foot which
   supposedly belonged to an Egyptian princess, Hermonthis. He intends to
   use the foot as a paperweight. In the night, he sees a vision of the
   princess, who explains her foot has been stolen, and he agrees to
   return her foot in exchange for a small statuette. The princess steals
   him away to Egypt where he meets her father and several other ancient
   pharaohs. Hermonthis' father, Xixouthros, is appropriately pleased that
   his daughter's foot is returned to the rest of her. Xixouthros asks
   what he can do in appreciation. The protagonist asks Hermonthis' hand
   in marriage, which is refused, as he is only 27 and Hermonthis is over
   30 centuries, and deserves someone who is equally durable. The
   protagonist is abruptly woken from this potential dream by the arrival
   of a friend. Now awake, he observes that the mummified foot that was on
   his desk has indeed been replaced by the statuette.
