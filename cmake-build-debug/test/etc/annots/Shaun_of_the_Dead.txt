   In Crouch End, London, electronics salesman Shaun has no direction in
   his life. He is disrespected by his colleagues, especially Noel, does
   not get along with his stepfather, Philip, and is dumped by his
   girlfriend, Liz. Heartbroken, Shaun gets drunk with Ed, his slacker
   best friend, at their favourite pub, the Winchester. At home, Shaun and
   Ed's flatmate, Pete, complains of a bite wound from a mugger and
   berates Shaun into getting his life together.

   By morning, a zombie apocalypse has overwhelmed London. Shaun and Ed
   are slow to notice until they encounter two zombies in their garden,
   whom they beat to death with a shovel and cricket bat. They devise a
   plan to rescue Liz and Barbara, Shaun's mother, and then wait out the
   crisis in the Winchester. They escape in Pete's car and pick up Philip,
   who's already been bitten, and Barbara. They then use Philip's car to
   pick up Liz and her flatmates, David and Dianne. Philip reconciles with
   Shaun before becoming a zombie.

   The group abandon the car and sneak through their London neighbourhood,
   running into friends and evading zombies by imitating them. They take
   refuge inside the Winchester, where Shaun discovers that the Winchester
   rifle above the bar is functional. Barbara reveals she was bitten along
   the way, and dies after giving Liz and Shaun's relationship her
   approval. David attempts to shoot Barbara, but Shaun stops him, causing
   the group to argue: Shaun accuses David of being in love with Liz,
   which Dianne admits. Shaun, distraught, is forced to shoot Barbara when
   she reanimates.

   Zombies break into the pub, devouring David, and Dianne rushes into the
   horde in an attempt to avenge him. The zombified Pete appears and bites
   Ed, and Shaun shoots and kills Pete. Shaun, Liz, and Ed take cover
   behind the bar, which Shaun sets ablaze before the trio take refuge in
   the cellar. Realising they only have two bullets left, Shaun and Liz
   contemplate suicide while Ed elects to be devoured by the zombies.
   Shaun discovers a keg lift that opens out onto the street, and Ed
   volunteers to stay with the rifle as the zombies break in. The arriving
   British Army guns down the horde, and take Shaun and Liz to safety.

   Six months later, civilisation has returned to normal, and surviving
   zombies are used as cheap labour and entertainment. Liz has moved in
   with Shaun, and Shaun keeps the zombified Ed tethered in his shed,
   where they play video games together.
