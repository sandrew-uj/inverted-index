   Written from 17 March to 9 April 1941 and sold on 24 April, the short
   story was published in the September 1941 issue of Astounding Science
   Fiction under editor John W. Campbell. It was the 32nd story by Asimov,
   written while he was a graduate student in chemistry at Columbia
   University. Campbell asked Asimov to write the story after discussing
   with him a quotation from Ralph Waldo Emerson:

     If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would
     men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the
     remembrance of the city of God!

   Campbell's opinion was to the contrary: "I think men would go mad". He
   and Asimov chose the title together.

   At more than 13,000 words, "Nightfall" was Asimov's longest story yet.
   Including a bonus from Campbell, he received US$166 (
   1+1/4 cents per word), more than twice any previous payment for a
   story. Asimov's name appeared on the cover of Astounding for the first
   time, and the story made him one of the field's top writers. Asimov
   later said that before "Nightfall" neither he nor anyone else other
   than perhaps Campbell considered him more than a "third rater".
   Asimov believed that the unusual plot of "Nightfall" distinguished it
   from others, but "The Last Question" was his own favorite story.

   In 1988, Martin H. Greenberg suggested Asimov to find someone who would
   take his 47-year-old short story and - keeping the story essentially as
   written - add a detailed beginning and a detailed ending to it. This
   resulted in the 1990 publication of the novel Nightfall by Isaac Asimov
   and Robert Silverberg. As Asimov relates in the Robert Silverberg
   chapter of his autobiography, "Eventually, I received the extended
   Nightfall manuscript from Bob ... Bob did a wonderful job
   and I could almost believe I had written the whole thing myself. He
   remained absolutely faithful to the original story and I had very
   little to argue with."
