   The Quaker City describes four main characters during the course of
   three days and nights. The story is set mostly in a Philadelphia
   mansion named "Monk Hall", which serves as a private gentlemen's club
   and is also secretly a brothel and opium den patronized by some of the
   city's most respected citizens. The main characters engage in various
   acts of debauchery, including the attempt at deflowering a young
   maiden. Devil-Bug, one of the book's most memorable characters, serves
   as the hall's caretaker and doorman.
