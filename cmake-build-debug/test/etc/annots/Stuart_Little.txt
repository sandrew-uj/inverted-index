   A boy named Stuart is born to an ordinary family in New York City. He
   is normal in every way except that he is only just over two inches high
   and looks exactly like a mouse. At first, the family is concerned with
   how Stuart will survive in a human-sized world, but by the age of
   seven, he speaks, thinks, and behaves on the level of a human of
   sixteen and shows surprising ingenuity in adapting, performing such
   helpful family tasks as fishing his mother's wedding ring from a sink
   drain. The family's cat, Snowbell, dislikes Stuart because while he
   feels a natural instinct to chase him, he is aware that Stuart is a
   member of the human family and thus off-limits.

   On a cold winter's day, the family discovers a songbird named Margalo
   half-frozen on their doorstep. Margalo is taken in and spends the
   winter in the family, where she befriends Stuart; Stuart in turn
   protects her from Snowbell. The bird repays his kindness by saving
   Stuart when he is trapped in a garbage can and shipped out to sea for
   disposal. In the spring, when she is set free from the house, she
   continues to visit Stuart, infuriating Snowbell, who now finds himself
   with two small animals he is not allowed to eat.

   Snowbell makes a deal with the Angora cat to eat Margalo to get rid of
   one of his temptations (reasoning that it's only wrong if he eats her).
   Margalo is warned and flees in the middle of the night. Stuart is
   heartbroken but becomes determined to find her. He first goes to the
   local dentist, Dr. Carey, who is a friend of Stuart. The dentist's
   patient, Edward Clydesdale, suggests that Margalo may have flown to
   Connecticut, and Dr. Carey loans Stuart his motorized, gas-powered toy
   car for the long journey.

   Stuart travels from adventure to adventure and finds himself in the
   town of Ames Crossing, where he takes work as a substitute teacher.
   There he learns that living in Ames Crossing is a fifteen-year-old girl
   named Harriet Ames who is the same size as Stuart but looks like a
   human being. Stuart purchases a miniature souvenir canoe, prepping it
   to make it comfortable and waterproof, and invites Harriet out on a
   boating date. However, when the two arrive for the date, the canoe has
   been discovered and played with by local children, who have ruined it.
   Harriet tries to be polite but is put off by Stuart's sulking over his
   broken boat. Stuart decides to leave Ames Crossing and continue on his
   quest to find Margalo. He sets off once more in his car, thinking that
   he will never see her again.
