   The Passage begins in the near future and details an apocalyptic and,
   later, post-apocalyptic world that is overrun by zombie/vampire like
   beings who are infected by a highly contagious virus. What begins as a
   project to develop a new immunity-boosting drug based on a virus
   carried by an unnamed species of bat in South America eventually
   becomes the virus that transforms the world. The novel begins in 2016
   and spans more than ninety years, as colonies of humans attempt to live
   in a world filled with superhuman creatures who are continually on the
   hunt for fresh blood.
