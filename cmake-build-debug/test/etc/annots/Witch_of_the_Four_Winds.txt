   Brak, a blond, braided and broadsword-wielding barbarian from the
   frozen north, continues his quest to reach the glorious southern realm
   of Khurdisan the Golden. In desolate country, he encounters malevolent
   magic. Boulders fall in a soundless rain, and a mysterious old stranger
   appears to know all about him. An invisible horror rends his pony to
   shreds. It seems he has some sorcerous foe against whom no mundane
   weapon can avail.

   After saving a shepherdess from the monstrous Manworm, Brak reaches the
   city of old Lord Strann, who rules the region as best he can but is
   threatened by the alchemist Nordica and her crony, the wizard Tamar
   Zed. Much of Strann's army has been lured to Nordica's side in the
   expectation of riches; Nordica's father possessed the knowledge of how
   to transmute base metal to gold, a secret for which she is thought to
   have murdered him.

   Brak, attempting to aid Strann, is caught by Nordica, joining three
   other captives--the girl he had previously rescued, an aged sailor, and
   a duplicitous smith. All four are slated to be sacrificed in a rite to
   make the gold. They attempt escape, are betrayed, and face more menace
   from the Manworm and Nordica's bestial familiar Scarletjaw. Ultimately
   Brak is victorious.

   Refusing the amorous advances of the grateful shepherd girl, whose
   attentions he diverts towards Strann's son and heir, Brak continues his
   journey towards Khurdisan.
