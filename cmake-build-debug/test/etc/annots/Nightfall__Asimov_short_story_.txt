   The planet Lagash ("Kalgash" in the novel) is constantly illuminated by
   at least one of the six suns of its multiple star system. Lagash has
   areas of darkness (in caves, tunnels, etc.), but "night" does not
   exist.

   A skeptical journalist visits a university observatory to interview a
   group of scientists who warn that civilization will soon end. The
   researchers explain that they have discovered evidence of numerous
   ancient civilizations on Lagash, all destroyed by fire, with each
   collapse occurring about 2,000 years apart. The religious writings of a
   doomsday cult claim that Lagash periodically passes through an enormous
   cave where mysterious "stars" appear. The stars are said to rain down
   fire from the heavens and rob people of their souls, reducing them to
   beast-like savages.

   The scientists use this apparent myth, along with recent discoveries in
   gravitational research, to develop a theory about the repeated collapse
   of society. A mathematical analysis of Lagash's orbit around its
   primary sun reveals irregularities caused by an undiscovered moon that
   cannot be seen in the light of the six suns. Calculations indicate that
   this moon will soon obscure one of Lagash's suns when it is alone in
   the sky, resulting in a total eclipse that occurs once every 2,000
   years. Having evolved on a planet with no diurnal cycle, Lagashians
   possess an intense, instinctive fear of the dark and have never
   experienced a prolonged period of widespread darkness. Psychological
   experiments have revealed that Lagashians experience permanent mental
   damage or even death after as little as 15 minutes in the dark, and the
   eclipse is projected to last for several hours.

   The scientists theorize that earlier civilizations were destroyed by
   people who went insane during previous eclipses and--desperate for any
   light source--started large fires that destroyed cities. Oral accounts
   of the chaos from crazed survivors and small children were passed down
   through the ages and became the basis for the cult's sacred texts.
   Present-day civilization is doomed for the same reasons, but the
   researchers hope that detailed observations of the upcoming eclipse
   will help to break the cycle of societal collapse.

   The scientists are unprepared, however, for the stars. Because of the
   perpetual daylight on Lagash, its inhabitants are unaware of the
   existence of stars apart from their own; astronomers believe that the
   entire universe is no more than a few light years in diameter and may
   hypothetically contain a small number of other suns. But Lagash is
   located in the center of a "giant cluster", and during the eclipse, the
   night sky--the first that people have ever seen--is filled with the
   dazzling light of more than 30,000 newly visible stars.

   Learning that the universe is far more vast--and Lagash far more
   insignificant--than they believed causes everyone, including the
   scientists, to go insane. Outside the observatory, in the direction of
   the city, the horizon begins glowing with the light of spreading fires
   as "the long night" returns to Lagash.
