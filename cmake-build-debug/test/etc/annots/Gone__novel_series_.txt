   Gone is a bestselling book series written by Michael Grant.^[1]

   The series is centered on the fictional Southern Californian town of
   Perdido Beach, in which every human aged 15 and older vanishes. The
   town and surrounding areas become encased within an impenetrable
   barrier that burns to the touch, with many of its inhabitants
   developing supernatural powers. The books follow the exploits of the
   protagonist/hero, Sam Temple, as he battles antagonists Caine Soren,
   Drake Merwin, and Diana Ladris as well as a mysterious, malevolent
   creature, known as the Darkness or the Gaiaphage (gai-uh-fage) (derived
   from Gaia, a Greek personification of the Earth, and "phage", from the
   Greek fagen phagein "to devour" or "worm").

   The first novel in this series, titled Gone, was published in 2008. The
   second book, Hunger, was released a year later, followed by the third
   book, Lies, on May 4, 2010. The fourth book, Plague, was released on
   April 5, 2011. The fifth book, Fear, was released on April 3, 2012, in
   the United States and the United Kingdom, although it was released as
   early as March 23 in Australia and Hong Kong. The sixth book, Light,
   was released on April 2, 2013. The series - "a fun, no-brainer read
   directed towards teenagers" - has been hailed as "ridiculously popular"
   and "a sensation in the young adult world".^[2]^[3]

   A planned Monster Trilogy, also known as Season Two, began on October
   17, 2017 with the release of Monster. It was set four years later from
   the events that took place in the other books. Villain was released on
   October 18, 2018 and Hero was released on October 1, 2019.
