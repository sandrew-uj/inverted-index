   A planet in the Alastor Cluster, Trullion is a bucolic place, inhabited
   by generally unambitious, somewhat hedonistic Trills, as the resident
   humans call themselves. Other inhabitants include the human nomadic
   Trevanyi, a generally despised gypsy-like people, and merlings, hostile
   semi-intelligent indigenous beings who keep to the water.
