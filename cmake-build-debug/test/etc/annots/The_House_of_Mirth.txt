   Poster for the serialized debut of The House of Mirth in Scribner's
   Magazine (1905)

   Lily Bart, a beautiful but impoverished socialite, is on her way to a
   house party at Bellomont, the country home of her best friend, Judy
   Trenor. Her pressing task is to find a husband with the requisite
   wealth and status to maintain her place in New York society. Additional
   challenges to her success are her advancing age--at twenty-nine, she
   has been on the "marriage market" for more than ten years--her penchant
   for gambling at bridge that has left her with debts beyond her means to
   pay, and her efforts as part of upper-crust society to keep up
   appearances with her wealthy friends. Lily's choices are further
   complicated by her innermost desire to marry for love as well as money
   and status, and her longing to be free of the claustrophobic
   constrictions and routines of upper-crust society.

   Judy has arranged for her to spend more time in the company of Percy
   Gryce, a potential suitor who is wealthy but whom Lily finds boring.
   Lily grew up surrounded by elegance and luxury--an atmosphere she
   believes she cannot live without, as she has learned to abhor
   "dinginess." The loss of her father's wealth and the death of her
   parents left her an orphan at twenty. Lacking an inheritance or a
   caring protector, she adapts to life as a ward of her strait-laced aunt
   Julia Peniston from whom she receives an erratic allowance, a
   fashionable address, and good food, but little direction or parenting.
   Lily is not fond of her aunt Julia and avoids her whenever possible
   while simultaneously relying on her for both necessities and luxuries.

   In the opening sentence of the House of Mirth Edith Wharton places Lily
   in "Grand Central Station" where Selden, a friend and possible love
   interest, is taken by surprise to see her. Threats to Lily's
   reputation exist because of her tendency to push the limits of polite
   and acceptable behavior. On the way to visit Bellomont, she impulsively
   accompanies Selden during her two-hour wait for the change of trains to
   his Manhattan flat in the Benedick Building. On leaving the building,
   she encounters Mr. Rosedale, a Jewish businessman known to her set and
   the owner of the building. Attempting to cover the appearance of an
   indiscretion, she worsens the situation by telling Rosedale she had
   been consulting her dress-maker. This obvious lie is the first of a
   series of faux pas Lily gets caught up in. As she makes an effort to
   explain away the social chances she takes, she becomes easy prey for
   her enemies to misrepresent her intention and behavior.

   Near the week's end, the tall, handsome and engaging Lawrence Selden
   unexpectedly shows up at Bellomont. Having already failed to meet Percy
   for morning church services, and fully aware that Lawrence has just
   ended an illicit relationship with the married but vindictive Bertha
   Dorset, Lily chooses to go for a long walk with Lawrence and to spend
   the afternoon with him instead of with Percy or the rest of the party.
   Even though Lily has already made it clear to Selden during their
   tete-`a-tete in his flat that she looked at him as that friend who
   won't be afraid to say disagreeable things to her, she becomes
   drawn to him romantically. Succumbing to her agreeable femininity,
   Selden is in love with Lily. He feels foolish in nurturing an emotional
   attachment to her because she clearly states that she cannot and will
   not marry a man of his modest means. Fresh out of his four-year affair
   with Bertha Dorset Lawrence begins to slide into another emotional
   attachment with the equally unavailable Lily.

   Lily's week at Bellomont ends up in a series of failures beginning with
   losing a large sum at bridge. She fails to become engaged to Percy
   Gryce despite his initial interest in her. Although she has presented
   herself as a conservative, innocent person so as to snare a
   conservative husband, her actions with Selden reveal her pretense. She
   exaggerates the extent of her relationship with Percy until everyone at
   Bellomont thinks an engagement between them is imminent. Bertha still
   has feelings for Lawrence notwithstanding her recent breakup with him.
   As she notices Selden's fondness for Lily, she decides to sabotage
   Lily's budding romance with Percy by filling him in on the most
   salacious and scandalous rumors about Lily's card-playing and past
   romantic life. This effectively frightens Percy away. Lily manages to
   cast the blame on Judy for having been the one to set the match up.

   On her last day at Bellomont, Lily creates threats to her social
   standing. Gus Trenor, a very skilled stockbroker, is married to Lily's
   best friend Judy. Judy is not particularly jealous of Gus's occasional
   conversations or flirtations with other women, unless he becomes so
   emotionally attached to them as to spend money on them or to give them
   money, which Judy rightly recognizes as a sign that the relationship
   has become a threat to their marriage. Lily is fully aware of Judy's
   jealousy on the money issue, and she is aware that Judy does not
   approve when other women, such as the financially embarrassed Carry
   Fisher, persuade Gus to speculate on their behalf in the stock market.
   Yet Lily persuades Gus to do just that. Lacking the financial knowledge
   to understand the difference between a legitimate loan or speculation,
   Lily flirts with Gus and allows him to hold her hand and lean against
   her. She convinces herself that Gus is making investments on her behalf
   and accepts several large checks from him. On several occasions,
   however, Gus makes it clear that he expects romantic attention from
   Lily in exchange for his financial expertise. Instead of discussing the
   issue openly, Lily begins to play cat and mouse with him. To avoid
   being with him in private, she appears in public with him at the opera
   and for late afternoon walks in Central Park with him. This attracts
   other people's attention.

   Gradually, Lily begins to suffer the consequences of her indiscreet
   behavior. Percy, having been scared away by Lily's behavior and Bertha
   Dorset's malicious gossip, proposes to a young woman named Evie Van
   Osburgh, who is much better suited to him than Lily and who was
   introduced to him by Bertha Dorset herself. Mrs. Dorset's public pride
   in her match-making victory results in social ridicule for Lily from
   the people whom she directly and indirectly misled into thinking she
   and Percy were all but engaged. Finally, in retribution for a social
   snub, Lily's cousin Grace Stepney informs their aunt Julia about rumors
   that Lily has gambling debts which she may be trying to cover through
   an inappropriate relationship with Gus Trenor. This sows seeds of doubt
   and discomfort in Aunt Julia who though shocked, does not discuss the
   situation with her niece so as to avoid a scene.
   The tragic heroine of The House of Mirth (1905), Lily Bart, lingers at
   the broad staircase, observing the high-society people gathered in the
   hall below.

   Furthermore, Lily has destroyed her relationship with Gus and Judy
   Trenor. Judy's attitude toward Lily has cooled, partly due to Lily's
   financial relationship with Gus and partly because Lily now avoids
   Bellomont because she does not wish to hold up her end on what
   everybody else believes to be a pay-for-play relationship.

   To avoid having to spend time alone with her aunt, the Trenors, Simon
   Rosedale, or anyone else she considers a possible source of
   embarrassment or boredom, Lily begins to accept invitations from people
   with whom she would not ordinarily socialize. These include the
   Wellington Brys, who are newcomers to the New York social scene whose
   social rise is being engineered by Carry Fisher. Carry, who earns money
   by acting as a social secretary to usher newly wealthy people into
   fashionable society, invites Lily to social events hosted by Louisa
   Bry. Lily also attends the opera with Carry, Simon Rosedale, and Gus
   Trenor. In the eyes of high society, Lily cheapens herself by
   voluntarily associating with her social inferiors. She returns briefly
   to Bellomont only to find that she is now being teased by her social
   peers for socializing with the upstart Brys and with Simon Rosedale.

   Lily is not entirely without resources for social rehabilitation or at
   least blackmail. One of her aunt's temporary servants, who is also the
   charwoman at Selden's apartment, sells Lily a package of torn love
   letters. These were written by Bertha Dorset, and they represent an
   opportunity for Lily to blackmail her enemy. But instead of
   blackmailing Bertha into a positive relationship, Lily tries to
   neutralize the gossip by making herself useful to Bertha. Bertha, who
   has a new love interest in the form of a young man named Ned Silverton,
   relies on Lily to distract her husband George Dorset.

   The extent to which Lily's reputation is damaged becomes obvious when
   Lily publicly appears in a way that comes across as advertising her
   availability for an illicit relationship. Following Mrs. Fisher's
   advice, the Wellington Brys throw a large "general entertainment"
   featuring a series of tableaux vivants portrayed by a dozen fashionable
   women in their set, including Miss Bart.

   The piece de resistance of this highly successful event turned out to
   be the portrayal of Mrs. Lloyd in Sir Joshua Reynolds' famous
   18th-century painting (1775-1776). The portrait shows an attractive
   woman suggestively clad. As the curtain opens on this last scene,
   the gasp of approval heard from the audience was not so much for
   Reynold's brilliant interpretation of Mrs. Lloyd as it was for the
   loveliness of Lily Bart herself--marking the pinnacle of her social
   success but also the annihilation of whatever reputation is left to
   her. For better or for worse, she has transitioned from a marriageable
   "girl" to a not-quite-reputable woman similar to Carry Fisher. Yet she
   does not do as Carry Fisher does, and accept the loss of her
   respectability as the price she must pay to maintain a position in
   society.

   As Selden observes her in this elegantly simple tableau, he sees the
   real Lily Bart as if for the first time and feels the desire to be
   with her. He finds her alone in the ballroom toward the end of the
   musical interlude, as the collective praise from her admirers is
   subsiding. He leads her to a garden where he tells her he loves her and
   they kiss. Lily sighs, " 'Ah, love me, love me--but don't tell me so!'
   " and takes her leave. As Selden gathers his coat to leave, he is
   disturbed by Ned Van Alstyne's remarks, ". . . .Gad, what a show of
   good-looking women; but not one of 'em could touch that little cousin
   of mine. . . . I never knew till tonight what an outline Lily has."

   The next day, Lily receives two notes--one from Judy Trenor inviting
   her to dine that evening at her town house and the other from
   Selden--asking to meet with her the following day. Though she had a
   dinner engagement, she agreed to a visit with Judy at ten o'clock.
   However, her late-evening encounter turns out to be with Gus alone. Gus
   vehemently demands the kind of attention he thought he had paid for.
   Pleading naivete about business matters and appealing to their
   friendship, she promises to pay back the almost $10,000 she owes him.
   With heightened anger and resentment, he accuses Lily of playing with
   him while entertaining other men. Lily gets him to back off and flees,
   getting into a hansom cab. Shaken and feeling very much alone, she is
   unaware that she has been seen by both Ned Van Alstyne and Lawrence
   Selden, both of whom were aware that Judy was out of town and that the
   Trenor house in New York is occupied by Gus alone. The unspoken
   conclusion, shared between the two men, is that the rumors of Lily's
   romantic involvement with Gus Trenor have a solid basis in fact. Ned,
   as a relative of the family, asks Lawrence to not tell anybody what
   they saw. But the damage is done. Lily calls on her friend Gerty Farish
   for succor and shelter for the rest of the night, and returns to her
   aunt in the morning.

   The following day Lily pleads with her aunt to help her with her debts
   and confesses that she has lost money gambling at bridge even on
   Sundays. Aunt Julia refuses to help her, except to cover the $1,000 to
   $2,000 bill for clothes and accessories. Feeling trapped and disgraced,
   she turns to thoughts of Selden as her savior and has a change of heart
   towards him as she looks forward to his visit at four o'clock.

   Instead, her visitor turns out to be Simon Rosedale who, so smitten by
   her appearance in the tableau vivant, proposes a marriage that would be
   mutually beneficial. Considering what Rosedale knows about her, she
   skillfully pleads for time to consider his offer  Selden does not
   appear for his 4:00 appointment nor does he send word in explanation.
   Instead he has departed for Havana and then on to Europe on business.
   This comes as a shock to Lily.

   To escape the rumors arising from the gossip caused by her financial
   dealings with Gus Trenor, and also disappointed by what she interprets
   as Selden's emotional withdrawal, Lily accepts Bertha Dorset's
   spur-of-the- moment invitation to join her and George on a
   Mediterranean cruise aboard their yacht, the Sabrina. Bertha intends
   for Lily to keep George distracted while Bertha carries on an affair
   with young Ned Silverton. Lily's decision to join the Dorsets on this
   cruise proves to be her social undoing.

   In order to divert the attention and suspicion of their social circle
   away from her, Bertha insinuates that Lily is carrying on a romantic
   and sexual liaison with George by commanding that she not return to the
   yacht in front of their friends at the close of a dinner the Brys held
   for the Duchess in Monte Carlo. Selden helps by arranging a night's
   lodging with her cousin Jack Stepney, under the promise that she leave
   promptly in the morning. The ensuing social scandal ruins Lily's
   reputation and almost immediately causes her friends to abandon her and
   Aunt Julia to disinherit her.

   Undeterred by such misfortunes, Lily fights to regain her place in high
   society by befriending Mr. and Mrs. Gormer and becoming their social
   secretary, so as to introduce the Gormers to high society and groom
   them to take a better social position. However, her enemy, the
   malicious Bertha Dorset, gradually communicates to them the
   "scandalous" personal background of Lily Bart, and thus undermines the
   friendship which Lily had hoped would socially rehabilitate her. Only
   two friends remain for Lily: Gerty Farish (a cousin of Lawrence Selden)
   and Carry Fisher, who help her cope with the social ignominy of a
   degraded social status while continually advising Lily to marry as soon
   as reasonably possible.

   Despite the efforts and advice of Gerty and Carry to help her overcome
   notoriety, Lily descends through the social strata of New York City's
   high society. She obtains a job as personal secretary of Mrs. Hatch, a
   disreputable woman who very nearly succeeds in marrying a wealthy young
   man in Lily's former social circle. It is during this occupation she is
   introduced to the use of chloral hydrate, sold in drugstores, as a
   remedy for malaise. She resigns her position after Lawrence Selden
   returns to warn her of the danger, but not in time to avoid being
   blamed for the crisis. Lily then finds a job in a milliner's shop; yet,
   unaccustomed to the rigors of working class manual labor, her rate of
   production is low and the quality of her workmanship is poor,
   exacerbated by her increased use of the drug. She is fired at the end
   of the New York social season, when the demand for fashionable hats has
   diminished.

   Meanwhile, Simon Rosedale, the Jewish suitor who previously had
   proposed marriage to Lily when she was higher on the social scale,
   reappears in her life and tries to rescue her, but Lily is unwilling to
   meet his terms. Simon wants Lily to use the love letters that she
   bought from Selden's servant to expose the love affair between Lawrence
   Selden and Bertha Dorset. For the sake of Selden's reputation, Lily
   does not act upon Rosedale's request and secretly burns the love
   letters when she visits Selden one last time.

   Lily is stopped on the street by Nettie Struther, who Lily once helped
   get to a hospital. Nettie is now married and has a baby girl, and she
   invites Lily to her apartment to meet and feed the baby with her. Lily
   goes to Nettie's and they play with the baby.

   Eventually, Lily Bart receives a ten-thousand-dollar inheritance from
   her Aunt Peniston, which she arranges to use to repay Gus Trenor.
   Distraught by her misfortunes, Lily has by this time begun regularly
   using a sleeping draught of chloral hydrate to escape the pain of
   poverty and social ostracism. Once she has repaid all her debts, Lily
   takes an overdose of the sleeping draught and dies; perhaps it is
   suicide, perhaps an accident. As she is dying, she hallucinates
   cradling Nettie's baby in her arms. That very morning, Lawrence Selden
   arrives to her quarters, to finally propose marriage, but finds Lily
   Bart dead. Among her belongings are receipts for her payments toward
   the debt she owed to Gus Trenor, proving that her financial dealings
   with Trenor were honorable and not evidence of an improper
   relationship. His realization allows him to feel sympathy and closeness
   for her, and he is clearly distraught at her death.
