   As the beginning of the story, all is well in the Kingdom of Calabiyau.
   King Toeyad, ruler of the Fee, a race of fairies, is benevolent and
   just, and the twelve clans of fairies live in relative peace. When the
   king dies, his teenage daughter, Kandide, is expected to ascend to the
   throne. While preparing for her coronation, one of Kandide's wings is
   crushed. The Fee value beauty above all else and so, to prevent the
   disgrace of having an "Imperfect" take the throne, Kandide's mother
   banishes her to the Veil of the Mists, a land to the East populated by
   treacherous creatures and imperfect Fee. Without a clear heir to the
   throne, Calabiyau is thrown into turmoil. Kandide's mother is put in
   mortal danger and cruel Lady Aron threatens to take the throne.
   Kandide's younger sister, Tara, and brother, Teren, are sent to find
   Kandide and bring her home in hopes that she can set everything right.
