   Mount Saint Helena in 1873

   Halpin Frayser, a 32-year-old resident of the Napa Valley, awakens from
   a dreamless sleep speaking the mysterious words "Catherine Larue" into
   the darkness. Earlier that day, Frayser went hunting in the vicinity of
   Mount Saint Helena. As he wanders the darkness and chooses a "road less
   travelled", it is clear there is something devious about. Halpin dreams
   about a haunted forest dripping with blood and is stricken with fear.
   In his dream, Halpin grabs a red-leather pocketbook and begins to write
   with blood a dark poem (in the manner of Freneau's "The House of
   Night") but before he can write too much, he is confronted by the
   corpse of his mother.

   The story then switches to Frayser's upbringing in Nashville,
   Tennessee. He never fit in with most of his family except for his
   mother. His penchant for poetry (albeit bad poetry) makes him a
   favorite to her. As Frayser becomes a young man, the relationship
   between mother and son is perceived as strange as they are together
   constantly. One day, Frayser tells her that he will go to California
   and though she initially tries to go with him, she relents. She has a
   dream that her son will die there by strangulation. While in San
   Francisco, Halpin is kidnapped onto a ship and spends several years at
   sea.

   The story switches back to the day after Halpin's confrontation with
   his mother's corpse. A deputy and detective are walking the roads near
   where Halpin was last seen, looking for a criminal named Branscom. They
   heard he is in town and plan to capture him. He's wanted for slicing
   the throat of a woman in California. While exploring an area beyond a
   graveyard, they find a body that clearly was in a struggle before
   dying. They discover that this is Halpin's body and a poem on him that
   he had just written. Nearby, they discover another headboard with the
   name Catherine Larue.

   It's at this point that the officer remembers that Larue was Branscom's
   original last name and Frayser was the name of the woman whom Branscom
   killed. The detectives hear an "unnatural" and "unhuman" laugh that
   fills them with dread.
