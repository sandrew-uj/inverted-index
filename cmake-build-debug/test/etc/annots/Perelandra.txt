   The story starts with the philologist Elwin Ransom, some years after
   his return from Mars at the end of Out of the Silent Planet, receiving
   a new mission from the Oyarsa (the angelic ruler) of Mars. Ransom
   summons narrator-Lewis to his country home. Ransom explains to Lewis
   that he (Ransom) is to travel to Perelandra (Venus), where he is to
   counter some kind of attack launched by Earth's Black Archon (Satan).

   Ransom is transported in a casket-like vessel seemingly made of ice,
   which contains only himself. Lewis blindfolds him so the sunlight will
   not blind him once he travels beyond the earth's atmosphere. He does
   not wear any clothes on the journey, as Oyarsa tells him clothes are
   unnecessary on Venus. He returns to Earth over a year later and is met
   by Lewis and another friend, then recounts his experiences. The
   remainder of the story is told from Ransom's point of view, with Lewis
   acting as interlocutor and occasional commentator.

   Ransom arrives in Venus after a journey in which he is surrounded by
   bright colours; the box dissolves, leaving Ransom on what appears to be
   an oceanic paradise. One day is about 23 Earth hours, in contrast to
   the roughly 24 and 25-hour days of Earth and Mars. The sky is golden
   but opaque, hence the sun cannot be seen. Daylight is somewhat dimmer
   than on Earth and the night is pitch black with no stars visible.

   The planet is covered, so far as Ransom can at first see, by a
   sweet-water ocean, which is dotted with floating rafts of vegetation.
   These rafts resemble islands, to the extent of having plant and animal
   life upon them, including a kind of dragon-like creature Ransom
   encounters early on. As the rafts have no geologic foundations, they
   are in a constant state of motion. The planet's sole observable
   geological feature is a mountain called the Fixed Land.

   Ransom soon meets the Queen of the planet, whose name is later revealed
   to be Tinidril; she is a carefree being who soon accepts him as a
   friend. Unlike the inhabitants of Mars in Out of the Silent Planet, she
   resembles a human in physical appearance with the exception of her skin
   colour, green; this is said to be the preferred form assumed by
   sentient creatures as a result of the incarnation of Maleldil, the
   second person of God, in human form. She and the King of the planet,
   who is largely unseen until the end, are the only human inhabitants and
   are the Eve and Adam of their world. They live on the floating
   raft-islands and are forbidden to sleep on the "Fixed Land".

   The rafts or floating islands are Paradise, not only in the sense that
   they provide a pleasant and care-free life, but also in that Ransom is
   for months naked in the presence of a beautiful naked woman without
   once lusting after her or being tempted to seduce her.

   This Paradise changes when Professor Weston arrives in a spaceship and
   lands in a part of the ocean quite close to the Fixed Land. He at first
   announces to Ransom that he is a reformed man after the events on Mars,
   but appears to still be in search of power. Instead of the strictly
   materialist attitude he displayed when first meeting Ransom, he asserts
   he has become aware of the existence of spiritual beings and pledges
   allegiance to what he calls the "Life-Force". Ransom, however, warns
   against Weston's position that not all spirituality is inherently good,
   and Weston, after a fit of pride, succumbs to full demonic possession.

   In this state, the possessed Weston finds the Queen and tries to tempt
   her into defying Maleldil's law by spending a night on the Fixed Land.
   Ransom tries to counter this through debate. Well versed in the Bible
   and Christian theology, Ransom realises that if the pristine Queen, who
   has never heard of Evil, succumbs to the tempter's arguments, the Fall
   of Man will be re-enacted on Perelandra. He struggles through day after
   day of lengthy arguments tempting the Queen to spiritual pride, as the
   demonic Weston shows super-human brilliance in debate, and moreover
   appears never to need sleep. He introduces the Queen to clothing and
   mirrors, and while she sleeps displays moronic, asinine behaviour and
   petty cruelty toward animals.

   With the demonic Weston on the verge of winning, the desperate Ransom
   senses in the night what he gradually realises is a Divine command to
   battle the Tempter physically, hand to hand. The bookish Ransom is
   afraid, and debates for hours with the divine inner voice. A curious
   twist is introduced here; although Ransom knows that his name derives
   historically from "Ranolf's Son", God reminds him that the Passion of
   Jesus was a ransom for humanity, and Ransom's name was actually
   arranged to foreshadow his present role. Inspired, Ransom decides to
   confront the Tempter outright.

   Ransom physically attacks his opponent clumsily. Weston's body is
   defeated despite the Tempter's superior guile, and he flees. Ransom
   chases him over the ocean on the backs of giant friendly fish. During a
   feigned truce, the "real" Weston temporarily re-emerges to recount his
   experience of Hell, the horror of being "digested" into the Devil,
   losing all independent existence. The moment Ransom is distracted by
   horror and pity, the demon takes Ransom by surprise and nearly drowns
   him. The chase continues into a cavern, where Ransom seemingly kills
   Weston's body and, believing his quest over, searches for the surface.
   Weston's body, horribly injured but still animated by the Tempter,
   follows him. When they meet for the last time in another cavern, Ransom
   defeats a psychological assault by a gruesome apparition, and finally
   throws Weston into the volcanic flames.

   Returning to the surface, Ransom recuperates from his injuries, except
   for a bite on his heel which continues bleeding for the rest of his
   life. Ransom carves a memorial inscription for Weston, to commemorate
   his scientific achievements and pioneering space travel, though also
   recording his surrender to the Devil.

   Ransom meets the King and Queen together with the Oyeresu of Mars and
   Venus, the latter of whom transfers dominion of the planet to the King
   and Queen. All the characters celebrate the prevention of a second
   biblical "Fall" and the beginning of a utopian paradise in this new
   world. The story climaxes with Ransom's vision of "The Great Dance":
   the exchange of higher and lower, as when an advisor gives power to a
   royal child. This is an allegory of life, and possibly of the nature of
   God, and alludes to the journey of Dante in the Divine Comedy.

   His mission finished, Ransom reluctantly returns to Earth; his new
   mission is to continue to fight evil on its home territory: the Earth.
