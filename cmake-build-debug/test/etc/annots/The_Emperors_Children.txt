   In 2001 in New York City three friends, who all showed signs of
   brilliance in their youth, reach their 30s without having achieved the
   promise they showed a decade earlier. Danielle Minkoff is the only one
   of her friends to hold a steady job, working as a producer for a TV
   program that makes documentaries. Marina Thwaite is the daughter of a
   revered literary critic and author, Murray Thwaite, who was offered a
   book contract to write about children's fashion years earlier and,
   having used up all her advance money and facing a hard deadline, moves
   back into her childhood home with her parents. Meanwhile, Julius
   Clarke, a brilliant and witty critic for The Village Voice, cannot
   sustain himself with his literary work and is forced to take temp jobs
   to supplement his income which, he finds demeaning. At one of his temp
   jobs he meets a successful, slightly younger, man called David Cohen
   and seduces him, eventually moving in with him and allowing himself to
   be kept like a housewife. He keeps Marina and Danielle away from David.

   Meanwhile, Danielle begins two flirtations, one with Ludovic Seeley, an
   Australian editor who has moved to New York City to start a literary
   journal called The Monitor, after Le Moniteur Universel, and another
   with Marina's father, Murray, who begins an email correspondence at
   first using her job and later concern over Marina's unemployment as
   reasons to keep contacting her.

   Marina, still hanging on to the last traces of her It-girl status, is
   unsettled by the arrival of her 19-year-old cousin Bootie, who has
   dropped out of university to pursue a program of educating himself by
   his own design. Bootie reveres the Thwaites and looks up to his uncle
   Murray, in whose footsteps he wants to follow; but Marina is
   dismissive, calling him "Fat Fredrick," and finds that he has installed
   himself in the Thwaite home creepy. Despite this, things quickly fall
   in line for Bootie: Murray is impressed by both his desire to leave his
   small town and his desire to self-educate and offers him a salary and
   work as his private secretary. Through Marina, Bootie also is able to
   rent Julius's old apartment.

   Though Danielle is more attracted to Seeley, she makes the mistake of
   introducing him to Marina as a possible editor for his magazine and
   watches from the sidelines as the two begin to work together and start
   a relationship. Seeley also inspires Marina to begin to work on her
   book anew, which she decides to name The Emperor's Children Have No
   Clothes, inspired by something that Seeley tells her. As the
   possibility of being with Seeley dissolves, Danielle begins sleeping
   with Murray.

   Working as Murray's secretary, Bootie discovers that his uncle is not
   the high-principled man he once thought he was and discovers that he
   self-plagiarizes articles, blows off low-paying events for star-studded
   ones and is writing a secret indulgent book called How to Live.
   Additionally, after discovering Murray's affair with Danielle, Bootie
   decides to write an expose on Murray for The Monitor.

   Over the 4th of July holiday weekend, Seeley and Marina become engaged,
   to the annoyance of Danielle and Murray, both of whom suspect that
   Seeley has some ulterior motive to take down Murray. Around the same
   time, Marina finishes her book and gives it to Murray to read. Finding
   it vapid and soulless, he urges her not to publish the book, causing a
   rift between father and daughter. Around the same time, Bootie finishes
   his expose on Murray and gives copies to his mother, Marina and Murray.
   Expecting them to applaud him for his honesty, he is shocked when all
   three are horrified by what he has written. Making matters worse,
   Seeley likes the piece and wants to publish it, causing a fight between
   him and Marina.

   Bootie becomes estranged from the Thwaites. Furthermore, after David
   loses his job, Julius takes back his apartment, causing Bootie to move
   to rent a room in an apartment and begin temping downtown.

   Marina goes forward with publishing her book and marrying Seeley. At
   their wedding, Danielle asks Murray to spend an entire night with her,
   something he has never done, always returning home after their trysts
   to his wife, Annabel. Murray has a cancellation on September 10 and
   thus decides to spend that night with Danielle. They spend the evening
   together and the following morning are able to see the September 11
   attacks from Danielle's apartment window. Terrified about what has
   happened, Murray abandons Danielle to go to Annabel. Danielle is
   heartbroken, realizing that though she thought of Murray as her
   soulmate, he has chosen Annabel over her. At the headquarters of The
   Monitor, Seeley realizes that his project is completely doomed as the
   launch was to take place that day but the attacks mean that the
   magazine cannot go to print, and that all the articles will seem
   obsolete anyway. Bootie's mother Judy waits to hear from her son and
   becomes disconcerted as days pass and she hears nothing. She enlists
   the Thwaites to help find her son and though they manage to track down
   the temp agency where he worked, they are unable to locate him and
   assume he has died.

   In a state of shock over her breakup, Danielle contacts her mother, who
   takes her on a vacation to Miami. While there Danielle sees Bootie
   working as a waiter. She tries to talk to him but he tells her his name
   is Ulrich New. After she leaves him he goes back to his hotel to flee
   once more.
