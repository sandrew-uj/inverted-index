   Billy Behan is an impoverished Irish American fifteen-year-old living
   in The Bronx with his crazy mother. One afternoon Billy is present when
   the Jewish mobster Dutch Schultz arrives to inspect a beer warehouse.
   When Billy demonstrates his skill at juggling, Schultz calls him a
   "capable boy" and tips him. After he later infiltrates the gang's
   offices, Schultz's accountant, Otto Berman, begins mentoring Billy, who
   assumes the surname of Bathgate after a local street.

   When Berman tasks Billy to spy on the gangsters who regularly
   congregate at a nightclub Schultz owns, Billy witnesses one of
   Schultz's lieutenants, Bo Weinberg, meeting with a pair of men
   affiliated with the Italian mafia. Schultz then has Weinberg and his
   girlfriend, a socialite named Drew Preston, kidnapped at gunpoint.
   Billy follows them out to a riverboat, where he witnesses Schultz
   getting Weinberg thrown into the East River with his feet encased in
   cement. Afterwards Schultz has Billy take Drew back to her apartment to
   get her belongings. There Billy learns that her wealthy husband,
   Harvey, is a closeted homosexual and that they share a marriage of
   convenience.

   Seeing Schultz as simply the latest of her sexual conquests, Drew
   agrees to become his gun moll and is taken with him when he settles in
   Onondaga as part of his plan to avoid conviction for tax evasion. There
   Billy is represented as Schulz's ward with Drew as his governess, while
   Schultz uses his money to buy several townspeople out of debt and
   cements his position within the community by converting to become a
   member of the local Catholic church. One afternoon, Drew goes for a
   country hike with Billy and asks him to tell her how Bo died.
   Afterwards, she scrambles down the side of a waterfall and swims in the
   pool underneath, where Billy comforts her.

   For the sake of appearances, Berman instructs Billy to take Drew to the
   races at Saratoga Springs while the trial takes place at Onondaga and
   the two begin an affair. But Billy comes to realize that the real
   reason Berman sent Drew away was to have her killed, as she has become
   a liability, so Billy arranges for ostentatious flowers and other gifts
   to be delivered to Drew's box at the races to draw attention to her. It
   is now impossible to touch her without being noticed. The ruse buys
   enough time for Harvey, whom Billy contacted beforehand, to collect her
   and take her out of the country before the hitmen sent by Schultz can
   act. Billy meanwhile deflects suspicion from himself by explaining that
   "rich folk" commonly act on impulse in this way.

   After Schultz is acquitted at his trial, federal prosecutor Thomas E.
   Dewey gives orders to have Schultz arrested if he returns to New York.
   Schultz flees to Newark and sets up an office in the back room of a
   chophouse. Against Berman's advice, Schultz decides to assassinate
   Dewey and orders Billy to shadow his apartment block in order to
   determine the best time to murder him. Before this can happen, gunmen
   sent by a rival gang leader storm the chophouse and shoot Schultz,
   Berman, and their bodyguards. Billy is small enough to escape out of a
   bathroom window and returns in time for the dying Berman to give Billy
   the code to Schultz's personal safe. Billy later hides in the hospital
   room and notes down the delirious Schultz's stream of consciousness
   monologue as he is dying. Later he uses clues from this to locate
   Schultz's concealed resources.

   The rival leader summons Billy to ask him about the location of
   Schultz's money, but Billy manipulates him into believing that Schulz's
   attorney Dixie Davis knows where it is hidden. Billy then returns to
   the Bronx to care for his mother. Next year Drew's chauffeur arrives at
   Billy's new home with an infant son, the product of his and Drew's time
   in Saratoga Springs. Now a father, and financed with the contents of
   Schultz's safe, Billy gets himself an education and takes part in World
   War II. It is only on his return that he retrieves Schultz's larger
   fortune to gain an undisclosed renown for himself.
