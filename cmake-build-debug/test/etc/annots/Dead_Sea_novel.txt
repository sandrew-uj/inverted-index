   The streets of the city are no longer safe. They are filled with
   zombies - the living dead, rotting predators driven only by a need to
   kill and eat. For Lamar Reed and a handful of others, their safe haven
   is an old ship out at sea. But it will soon become a deathtrap, and
   they'll learn that isolation can also mean no escape.
