   Dream Park is a 1981 novel written by Larry Niven and Steven Barnes set
   in a futuristic amusement park of the same name. It was nominated for
   the 1982 Locus Award^[1] and later expanded into a series of books: The
   Barsoom Project (1989), The California Voodoo Game (1992), The Moon
   Maze Game (2011). The books describe a futuristic form of live action
   role-playing games (LARPs), although the term was not in use when the
   original novel was published. The novels inspired many LARP groups,
   notably the International Fantasy Games Society, named after a
   fictional entity in the book.^[2]
