   The series is set thousands of years in the future in a time known as
   the Traction Era, in which Earth has been reduced to a wasteland by a
   devastating conflict known as the Sixty Minute War. Nations no longer
   exist except in the lands of the Anti-Traction League; whereas Traction
   Cities--mobile cities mounted on caterpillar tracks--are fiercely
   independent city-states that use giant mechanical jaws to dismantle one
   another for resources. Trade is mostly accomplished by airship or
   between mobile cities of roughly equal size (which are thus unable to
   devour each other). Old-Tech (technology from before the Traction Era,
   some from the 21st century) is the most sought-after commodity.
     * The Great Hunting Ground - Consists of Europe and Northern Asia,
       and is the domain of the Traction Cities. It is a muddy wasteland,
       in which the constant movement of the cities has destroyed all
       vegetation. The land is identified by city-dwellers as the
       "Out-Country".
     * The Ice Wastes - New name for the Arctic, wherein Traction Cities
       use iron runners to skate across the ice. In some places, the ice
       is thin, and they risk falling in the ocean.
     * Africa - Africa is split between the Sahara Desert, governed by
       Traction Cities, and the southern regions, run by
       Anti-Tractionists. Areas of the southern continent include the
       static cities of Zagwa and Tibetsi, and the highland area known as
       the Mountains of the Moon.
     * The Dead Continent - North America, supposedly reduced to an
       irradiated wasteland by the Sixty Minute War. In Predator's Gold,
       it is proven not to be completely dead; in the north, there are
       forests with some animals that survived the Sixty Minute War.
     * Asia - The stronghold of the Anti-Traction League. Eastern China is
       evidently irradiated by the War, and the Himalayas is now the
       center of civilization, where the mountains make it impossible for
       cities to approach.
     * Nuevo Maya - New name for South America, severed from North America
       when "slow bombs" destroyed Central America during the war. Static
       settlements rule the Andes, but the lowlands are filled with
       ziggurat Traction Cities. Protagonists Tom and Hester visit Nuevo
       Maya between the first two books, but it is never visited in the
       text.
     * Antarctica - Mentioned only once, and evidently the domain of
       oil-drilling Traction Cities. Tom and Hester visit Antarctica
       between the first two books, but it is not described in the text.
     * Anchorage-in-Vineland - The static and stable version of the
       Traction City of Anchorage, which had decided to stop wandering the
       Arctic wastes and settle in the green and unspoiled land of
       Vineland (in North America). When Anchorage was a Traction City, it
       was not predatory but gained its wealth by trading with other
       cities under more scrupulous leaders.
