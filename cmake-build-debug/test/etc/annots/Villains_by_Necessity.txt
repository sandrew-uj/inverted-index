   Over a century after the ultimate triumph of good over evil, the
   world's last assassin and the world's last thief discover from a druid
   that, without more evil, the world will be destroyed. With the help of
   an evil sorceress and a black knight, the party sets out to save it
   from the misguided forces of good.
