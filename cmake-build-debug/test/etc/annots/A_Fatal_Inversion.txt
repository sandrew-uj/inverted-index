   In the process of burying a beloved dog in the animal cemetery of Wyvis
   Hall, a beautiful Suffolk country house, the owner unearths the
   skeletons of a dead woman and baby. The horrific discovery challenges
   the buried memories and guilt of a small group of young people who, 10
   years earlier, spent the broiling Summer of 1976 in a self-indulgently
   irresponsible idyll at Wyvis Hall, unexpectedly inherited by one of
   their number. Slowly the facts emerge and the past catches up with
   them. But which woman is dead? And whose child?
