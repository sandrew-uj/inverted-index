   A human starship intercepts a mysterious signal and tracks it back to
   Carina 4269, a star system 212 light years from Earth. Two elite
   scouts, Adam Reith and Paul Waunder, are dispatched in a small
   scout-boat to investigate the planet whence it came. Seconds later, a
   missile destroys their mothership. The two survivors nurse the severely
   damaged scout-boat to the planet before ejecting into a forest.

   The crash site is first discovered by a band of technologically
   primitive humans who wear special, personality altering emblems. Reith
   is amazed to find men on a heretofore unknown, distant planet. One of
   them casually kills Waunder; Reith remains undetected. A second party
   approaches in a large sky-raft, sending the humans scurrying into
   hiding. It is manned (as Reith later learns) by massive, alien Blue
   Chasch and their human Chaschmen servants. Their investigation of the
   wreckage is interrupted by a third group, belonging to the Dirdir. The
   Chasch ambush the tall, pale Dirdir and their human Dirdirmen, driving
   them off. The Chasch then haul the scout-boat away.

   Injured and helpless, Reith cannot avoid being taken captive by Traz
   Onmale, the grave, mature boy-chieftain of the Kruthe, the
   Emblem-wearing tribe which killed Waunder. While his wounds heal, Reith
   incurs the wrath of the "magicians" who are actually in charge, by
   showing kindness and affection to a slave girl, a grave violation of
   tribal social norms. Before he can be castrated to make him more
   docile, he escapes, taking Traz with him. The teen is not unwilling to
   go, since he would be expected to sacrifice himself to the gods in the
   near future due to the misfortunes the tribe has faced.

   On their trek, Reith rescues an outcast Dirdirman, Ankhe at afram
   Anacho, from a Phung, an extremely dangerous native. With no plans of
   his own, he joins them. From Anacho's explanation of Dirdirman
   theology, Reith deduces that the Dirdir were responsible for bringing
   humans to Tschai tens of thousands of years ago. His mission is now
   clear - he must alert Earth to the possible threat of the Dirdir.

   The mismatched trio join a trade caravan. Among the other passengers is
   a group of priestesses, taking a beautiful female captive, Ylin-Ylan,
   home to participate in an important rite. Reith frees her, but on the
   lawless steppes, the woman is stolen by the caravan's scouts and
   returned to the priestesses. Reith rescues her from the seminary and
   learns that the mysterious signal originated from her people.

   The caravan is attacked by Green Chasch just outside the run-down city
   of Pera, but Reith's group manages to reach safety. The town is ruled
   by Naga Goho and his brigands. Ylin-Ylan attracts his attention; she
   and Traz are taken prisoner, forcing Reith to organize a revolt to
   overthrow the tyrant. Naga Goho is publicly hung.

   Reith's locator indicates his scout-boat is in the nearby Blue Chasch
   city of Dadiche. He sneaks in and finds his ship, apparently intact,
   but is spotted before he can make a closer inspection. He barely
   escapes with his life. When he returns to Pera, he finds to his chagrin
   that he has been elected the new chief of the city. He begins trying to
   bring civilization to it by organizing a form of government and,
   importantly on the Steppes, an army. At first the army is a sad sight,
   but Reith uses his experience as a soldier to guide them into something
   resembling a coherent force.

   A group of Blue Chasch arrives in Pera, demanding Reith's surrender.
   When he refuses, a battle erupts, which the newly organized humans win
   thanks to the element of surprise; the Chasch did not think advanced
   tactics possible from humans. The Blue Chasch then send their entire
   armed might, but Reith arranges for the Green Chasch, the mortal
   enemies of the Blue Chasch, to ambush and wipe them out.

   With Dadiche now defenseless, Reith and the men of Pera take charge.
   While their training made them good fighters, it failed to instill true
   discipline. The army goes on a revenge fueled rampage that, despite his
   best efforts, Reith is unable to control and the Blue Chasch and any
   Chaschmen who move to resist are slaughtered. He frees the surviving
   Chaschmen and gives them the city, after revealing that they had been
   duped. The Chaschmen had been told they were transformed at death into
   Chasch. Baby Chasch were implanted in their corpses in secret, to
   emerge before Chaschmen witnesses.

   When Reith checks his scout-boat, he discovers to his dismay that it
   has been gutted. Ylin-Ylan convinces him to take her back to
   technologically advanced Cath, where he might be able to build a ship
   with the backing of her wealthy father.
