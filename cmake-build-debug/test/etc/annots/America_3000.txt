   Young Plugots, Korvis and Gruss, are taken as slaves to the 'Comb of
   the Friscos', a Frau base. Korvis starts a riot, and the pair manage to
   escape. The boys flee into 'the contamns', an old irradiated territory
   where the religious Frau cannot pursue them. In the contamns, Korvis
   and Gruss find a children's book, and a top-hat.

   Korvis and Gruss band together with other escaped Plugots, and spend
   years forming a comb of their own in the contamns, out of the ruins of
   an old 'Murcan' army base named Camp Reagan. Korvis spends his free
   time reading and educating himself from the children's book, coming to
   the realization that they are all 'Men', rather than Plugots. Gruss
   goes on to elaborate that, while the refined males of their camp were
   now 'Men'; feral, less intellectual Plugots still did exist, driven by
   hunger and stupidity. On the way back to the Comb of the Friscos, Reya,
   the Queen of the Frau (known as a Tiara), is gravely wounded during an
   ambush by feral Plugots.

   Upon arrival at the Comb of the Friscos, Reya is near death, and
   informs her daughters about a secret map in her shelter, instructing
   them to follow it. Reya passes on her title of Tiara to the eldest
   daughter, Vena, much to the dismay of the younger sister, Lakella. Upon
   hearing of Reya's death, Morha, the Tiara of Kansos, and her sister,
   Freyha, arrive at the gates of the Comb of Frisco. A funeral for Reya
   and a celebration for Vena's crowning are held at the camp. A prayer is
   held, blessing Vena's rule until the great 'Prezeedent' arrives to lead
   them all to salvation. Lakella is seen as the stronger sister by Morha,
   and was expected to be the new Tiara of Frisco. Morha and Freyha
   discuss the unrest during Vena's crowning, and look for an opportunity
   to annex the comb into their own fold. Vena finds the map, which shows
   a path through the entirety of 'the contamns'. Lynka, Vena's closest
   friend, warns her that, if her sister Lakella finds out about her
   intent to break the sacred rules, Vena will certainly be overthown.

   Korvis attacks the Comb of the Friscos and releases the remaining male
   slaves, but finds himself needing to distract the pursuing Frau. He
   leads Lakella and Vena into the contamns, where the women catch up to
   him. Lakella shoots Korvis, knocking him into a ravine. Korvis awakens,
   narrowly avoiding death, as Lakella's arrow was stopped by the
   children's reading book. Korvis searches for an exit, but instead comes
   across an old vault door. Inside the vault, Korvis discovers a stash of
   laser weapons, a boombox, a radiation suit, and a message for the
   President of The United States. Korvis uses his newfound technology to
   roleplay the mythical god-character of 'The Prezeedent', and seeks to
   kidnap a close friend of Vena to trade in exchange for diplomacy.

   Gruss and Relk ambush a Frau seeder camp, and capture Lynka. Later that
   night, Korvis rains fire from the sky and terrorizes the Frau to get
   their attention, commanding that Vena meet 'the prezeedent' at sunrise
   in the contamns. Vena meets with 'the prezeedent' and, in exchange for
   Lynka's life, follows him to the presidential bunker. Inside, Korvis
   reveals his true identity to Vena, and shows her that, as she is
   'woman', he is 'man'. Korvis invites her to feel his flesh, ultimately
   leading to the couple having intercourse. Meanwhile, back at the Frau
   base, Morha and Freyha conspire against Vena, and convince Lakella to
   usurp her sister's crown. In a display of power, Lakella launches an
   assault on the Plugot base.

   During the assault on the mens camp, many lives are lost. Morha is
   knocked off her horse by a grenade and is trampled by the remaining
   soldiers, Amie is killed by an oncoming thunder-rock, and Lakella is
   killed in hand-to-hand combat with Gruss. Korvis, upon arriving home to
   the wreckage, angrily launches a counter-offensive, believing Vena is
   to blame. At the Frisco gates, Korvis meets a surrendering Vena, who
   was unaware of the ambush plans or her sister's treachery. Vena and
   Korvis throw down their weapons, and kiss. The onlooking men and women
   follow suit, signaling an end to the war between them.
