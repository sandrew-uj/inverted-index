   Dorothy is a young girl who lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and
   dog, Toto, on a farm on the Kansas prairie. One day, she and Toto are
   caught up in a cyclone that deposits them and the farmhouse into
   Munchkin Country in the magical Land of Oz. The falling house has
   killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of the Munchkins.
   The Good Witch of the North arrives with three grateful Munchkins and
   gives Dorothy the magical silver shoes that once belonged to the Wicked
   Witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return
   home is to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and ask the
   great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her. As Dorothy embarks on her
   journey, the Good Witch of the North kisses her on the forehead, giving
   her magical protection from harm.

   On her way down the yellow brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet held
   by a Munchkin named Boq. The next day, she frees a Scarecrow from the
   pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted
   joints of a Tin Woodman, and meets a Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants
   a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Lion wants courage, so
   Dorothy encourages them to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald
   City to ask for help from the Wizard. After several adventures, the
   travelers arrive at the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the
   Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes
   from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see
   the Wizard. He appears to Dorothy as a giant head, to the Scarecrow as
   a lovely lady, to the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and to the Lion
   as a ball of fire. He agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked
   Witch of the West, who rules over Winkie Country. The Guardian warns
   them that no one has ever managed to defeat the witch.

   The Wicked Witch of the West sees the travelers approaching with her
   one telescopic eye. She sends a pack of wolves to tear them to pieces,
   but the Tin Woodman kills them with his axe. She sends a flock of wild
   crows to peck their eyes out, but the Scarecrow kills them by twisting
   their necks. She summons a swarm of black bees to sting them, but they
   are killed while trying to sting the Tin Woodman while the Scarecrow's
   straw hides the others. She sends a dozen of her Winkie slaves to
   attack them, but the Lion stands firm to repel them. Finally, she uses
   the power of her Golden Cap to send the Winged Monkeys to capture
   Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion, unstuff the Scarecrow, and dent the Tin
   Woodman. Dorothy is forced to become the witch's personal slave, while
   the witch schemes to steal her silver shoes.
   The Wicked Witch melts, from the W. W. Denslow illustration of the
   first edition (1900)

   The witch successfully tricks Dorothy out of one of her silver shoes.
   Angered, she throws a bucket of water at the witch and is shocked to
   see her melt away. The Winkies rejoice at being freed from her tyranny
   and help restuff the Scarecrow and mend the Tin Woodman. They ask the
   Tin Woodman to become their ruler, which he agrees to do after helping
   Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy finds the witch's Golden Cap and
   summons the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her friends back to the
   Emerald City. The King of the Winged Monkeys tells how he and his band
   are bound by an enchantment to the cap by the sorceress Gayelette from
   the North, and that Dorothy may use it to summon them two more times.

   When Dorothy and her friends meet the Wizard again, Toto tips over a
   screen in a corner of the throne room that reveals the Wizard, who
   sadly explains he is a humbug--an ordinary old man who, by a hot air
   balloon, came to Oz long ago from Omaha. He provides the Scarecrow with
   a head full of bran, pins, and needles ("a lot of bran-new brains"),
   the Tin Woodman with a silk heart stuffed with sawdust, and the Lion a
   potion of "courage". Their faith in his power gives these items a focus
   for their desires. He decides to take Dorothy and Toto home and then go
   back to Omaha in his balloon. At the send-off, he appoints the
   Scarecrow to rule in his stead, which he agrees to do after helping
   Dorothy return to Kansas. Toto chases a kitten in the crowd and Dorothy
   goes after him, but the ropes holding the balloon break and the Wizard
   floats away.

   Dorothy summons the Winged Monkeys and tells them to carry her and Toto
   home, but they explain they can't cross the desert surrounding Oz. The
   Soldier with the Green Whiskers informs Dorothy that Glinda, the Good
   Witch of the South may be able to help her return home, so the
   travelers begin their journey to see Glinda's castle in Quadling
   Country. On the way, the Lion kills a giant spider who is terrorizing
   the animals in a forest. They ask him to become their king, which he
   agrees to do after helping Dorothy return to Kansas. Dorothy summons
   the Winged Monkeys a third time to fly them over a hill to Glinda's
   castle. Glinda greets them and reveals that Dorothy's silver shoes can
   take her anywhere she wishes to go. She embraces her friends, all of
   whom will be returned to their new kingdoms through Glinda's three uses
   of the Golden Cap: the Scarecrow to the Emerald City, the Tin Woodman
   to Winkie Country, and the Lion to the forest; after which the cap will
   be given to the King of the Winged Monkeys, freeing him and his band.
   Dorothy takes Toto in her arms, knocks her heels together three times,
   and wishes to return home. Instantly, she begins whirling through the
   air and rolling on the grass of the Kansas prairie, up to the
   farmhouse, though the silver shoes fall off her feet en route and are
   lost in the Deadly Desert. She runs to Aunt Em, saying "I'm so glad to
   be home again!"
