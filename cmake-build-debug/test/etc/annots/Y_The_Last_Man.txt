   On July 17, 2002, all living mammals with a Y chromosome--including
   embryos and sperm--simultaneously die, with the exception of a young
   amateur escape artist named Yorick Brown and his Capuchin monkey,
   Ampersand. Many women die from disasters caused by the men's deaths,
   such as plane crashes. Society is plunged into chaos as infrastructures
   collapse, and the surviving women everywhere try to cope with the loss
   of the men, and the belief that, barring a rapid, major scientific
   breakthrough or other extraordinary happening, humanity is doomed to
   extinction.

   Yorick's mother, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives,
   commissions Agent 355 of the Culper Ring to protect Yorick. The two
   travel to meet geneticist and cloning expert Dr. Allison Mann, who
   works to discover why Yorick survived and find a way to save humankind.
   Due to damage at Mann's laboratory in Boston, the trio first travel
   across the country to Mann's other lab in San Francisco, then to
   Australia and Japan.

   During the trip, the group is chased by multiple parties who know of
   Yorick's existence and want to capture or kill him for their own
   purposes, including an Israeli army commando named Alter, the militant
   Daughters of the Amazon, and a ninja. They also meet friendly women
   such as Yorick's sister Hero (who is initially brainwashed to kill her
   brother), a Russian soldier named Natalya, an astronaut named Ciba, a
   former flight attendant named Beth who becomes pregnant after a
   one-night stand with Yorick, and Rose, an Australian sailor.

   In China, the group learns Mann's father, Dr. Matsumori, is also still
   alive and has created many clones of Allison Mann. He also reveals that
   Ampersand had been one of his lab animals, and that he only ended up in
   Yorick's care by accident. When Mann learns that Matsumori plans to
   murder Yorick before committing suicide, she kills him. Armed with the
   samples and information she needs, Mann stays in China to work on
   cloning.

   Yorick and 355 journey to Paris, France, where Yorick is reunited with
   his fiancee. After initially celebrating their reconnection, Yorick
   realizes he actually loves 355. It's not the woman he was looking for
   that he loved, but the woman walking alongside him. 355 feels the same,
   but at the moment they finally come together 355 is killed by Alter.
   When the Israeli commando attempts to capture Yorick, he defeats her
   and learns her dedicated pursuit of him was actually a roundabout way
   of suicide. He lets her live, and she is remanded into the custody of
   the Israelis.

   Yorick marries Beth, and their daughter becomes President of France.
   Hero and Yorick's former fiancee become lovers, Mann successfully
   begins cloning humans, and society eventually stabilizes. At least
   seventeen Yorick clones are produced, and geneticists are able to
   produce clones of other males. At age 85, Yorick is institutionalized
   following a joke interpreted as a suicide attempt. After imparting
   advice to one of his clones, he frees himself from his straitjacket and
   escapes.
