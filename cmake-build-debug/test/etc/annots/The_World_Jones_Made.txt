   The World Jones Made is set in the year 2002 AD. On a then-future
   post-apocalyptic Earth, there was a devastating conflict that involved
   the use of atomic weapons. Many American cities were targeted, and the
   People's Republic of China (and Soviet Union) also collapsed, leading
   to the imposition of a Federal World Government (Fedgov).

   In this particular dystopia, Relativism (a political theory having
   little to do with Albert Einstein) emerged as the governing political
   orthodoxy. Relativism is said to be a moral and ethical philosophy that
   states everyone is free to believe what they wish, as long as they
   don't make anyone else try to follow that principle. Relativism has
   become established law after the destructiveness of the war unleashed
   by clashing ideologies. (However, dissidents from that orthodoxy do end
   up in forced labor camps.) This sacrosanct principle is challenged by a
   man named Floyd Jones, whose assertions about the future prove correct.

   Relativism enables legal consumption of drugs like heroin and
   marijuana, as well as watching live sex shows with hermaphrodite human
   mutants. Due to the mutagenic effects of radiation from wartime nuclear
   exchanges, mutants earn their living within the entertainment industry,
   although one group has been subjected to deliberate genetic
   engineering, which later enables them to settle (an inhabitable) Venus.

   Doug Cussick is an agent of Fedgov, and his involvement with Jones
   encompasses this book. Jones has precognitive abilities that let him
   see a year into the future, which allows Dick to explore questions of
   predestination, free will and determinism.

   Fedgov encounters apparently unintelligent alien lifeforms named
   Drifters, which turn out to be one gamete of a spore-based migratory
   alien life form. Their apparently pointless destruction leads to a
   retaliatory alien quarantine of the human race to a few nearby star
   systems. The presence of the Drifters in the story is to give Jones an
   initial rallying-point for all of his xenophobic followers. The
   collapse of Fedgov and rise of Jones to become world dictator have some
   similarities to the historical fall of the Weimar Republic and rise of
   Hitler to power in Germany. Jones' ability to see the future a year in
   advance makes him a charismatic leader, whose followers see him as
   infallible - forgetting that seeing a year in advance leaves him just
   as blind as anyone to what might happen later than a year in the
   future.

   In the event, the plot demonstrates, in the context of ensuing events,
   that Jones is far more susceptible to error than he was previously
   willing to admit. His whole approach has been one of an all-or-nothing
   gamble on the infallibility of his precognitive powers.

   Jones foresees his own assassination one year before it actually
   happens. Not only does he not attempt to avoid his execution, but he
   actually facilitates it by leaping into the path of a bullet meant for
   a bodyguard. This does not occur, however, before he and his followers
   create a cult that overthrows Fedgov, leading to the resettlement of
   Doug, his wife Nina and their three-year-old son in an artificial
   habitat on Venus.

   The novel addresses questions of Jones's agenda and trustworthiness as
   well as the decidedly ambiguous benefits of individual precognition.
