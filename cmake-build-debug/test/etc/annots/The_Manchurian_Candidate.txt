   Major Bennett Marco, Sergeant Raymond Shaw, and the rest of their
   infantry platoon are captured by an elite Soviet commando unit during
   the Korean War in 1952. They are taken to Manchuria, and brainwashed
   into believing Shaw saved their lives in combat - for which Shaw is
   subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.

   Years after the war, Marco, now back in the United States working as an
   intelligence officer, begins suffering a recurring nightmare in which
   the seated platoon members are surrounded by a group of sweet little
   old ladies who had been a part of their brainwashing. One of the ladies
   tells Sergeant Shaw to murder two of his platoon comrades. The backdrop
   with the old ladies changes back and forth between them and
   Chinese/Soviet intelligence officials. When Marco learns that another
   of the platoon's soldiers has been suffering the exact same nightmare,
   he starts looking into why this is happening.

   Major Marco looks up Sergeant Raymond Shaw and discovers that Shaw's
   new manservant is someone he recognizes from Korea. Marco and the
   manservant start fighting in Shaw's house and both are bloodied
   significantly. Marco is arrested, and when Shaw sees that it is his old
   major they rekindle their old friendship. Both find love interests: for
   Marco, it is Rose Cheyney, whom he meets on a train; and for Raymond,
   it is Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of Senator Thomas Jordan, a neighbor
   of Shaw's. Senator Jordan and Shaw's mother do not like each other, but
   Raymond continues to see Jocelyn.

   It is revealed that the Communists have been using Shaw as a sleeper
   agent who, activated by a post-hypnotic trigger, immediately forgets
   the assignments he carries out and therefore can never betray the
   operation either purposely or inadvertently. In Shaw's case, the
   suggestion that he play solitaire is the trigger. Seeing the queen of
   diamonds playing card transforms him into an assassin who will kill
   anyone at whom he is directed. Shaw's KGB handler is his domineering
   mother, Eleanor. Married to McCarthy-esque Senator Johnny Iselin,
   Eleanor has convinced the Communist powers to help install her husband
   as president and allow them to control the American government through
   him.

   By observing Shaw, Marco discovers the trigger shortly before the
   national convention of Iselin's political party. He uses the queen of
   diamonds card to draw out Eleanor's plan: after she obtains the vice
   presidential nomination for Iselin, Shaw is to shoot the presidential
   candidate so that Iselin can succeed him. Blaming the killing on the
   Communists will enable Iselin to assume dictatorial powers. Marco
   reprograms Shaw, although it is unclear until the final pages whether
   this is successful. At the convention, Shaw instead shoots and kills
   his mother and Senator Iselin. Marco is the first person to reach
   Shaw's sniper nest, getting there just before Shaw turns the gun on
   himself and commits suicide.
