   In the early 1960s, at a San Francisco pet store, socialite Melanie
   Daniels meets lawyer Mitch Brenner who is looking to buy lovebirds for
   his sister Cathy's 11th birthday. Recognizing Melanie from her court
   appearance regarding a practical joke gone awry, Mitch pretends to
   mistake her for a shop employee. Mitch tests Melanie's knowledge of
   birds, which she fails. He discloses his prior knowledge of her and
   that his ruse was intended to make her appreciate being on the other
   end of a joke. Mitch leaves without buying anything. To make amends,
   and finding him attractive, Melanie buys the lovebirds and drives to
   Bodega Bay, after she learns Mitch has gone there for the weekend to
   his family's farm. Melanie is directed to the local teacher, Annie
   Hayworth, to learn Cathy's name. Annie previously dated Mitch, but
   ended it due to Mitch's cold, overbearing mother, Lydia, who dislikes
   any woman in Mitch's life.

   In town, Melanie rents a boat and crosses the bay to discreetly leave
   the lovebirds at the Brenner farm. Mitch spots Melanie during her
   retreat and drives into town to meet her at the dock. As Melanie
   approaches the wharf, a gull attacks her. Mitch tends her head wound
   inside the cafe. Lydia arrives, meets Melanie, and Mitch announces to
   Lydia that he is inviting Melanie to dinner. Melanie returns to Annie's
   house and asks to spend the night. At the farm, Lydia's hens are
   suddenly refusing to eat. Lydia expresses her disapproval of Melanie to
   Mitch, due to her exaggerated reputation as reported in gossip columns.
   Mitch calls Melanie and invites her to Cathy's birthday party being
   held the next day. Shortly after, there is a violent thud at Annie's
   front door. A dead gull is found at the threshold.

   At Cathy's party, Melanie privately tells Mitch about her troubled past
   and her mother running off with another man when Melanie was Cathy's
   age. During a game, the children are attacked and some injured by
   gulls. The following evening, as Melanie dines with the Brenners,
   sparrows swarm the house through the chimney. After, Mitch insists she
   delay driving back to San Francisco and stay the night. The next
   morning, Lydia visits her neighbor to discuss why their chickens won't
   eat. She discovers his eyeless corpse, pecked lifeless by birds, and
   flees in horror. As Lydia recovers at home, she fears for Cathy's
   safety, and Melanie offers to pick her up at school. As Melanie waits
   outside the schoolhouse, a large flock of crows slowly engulfs the
   jungle gym behind her. Anticipating an attack, she warns Annie. As they
   evacuate the children, the crows attack, injuring several children.
   Mitch finds Melanie at the restaurant. Outside, when a gas station
   attendant is attacked by gulls, Mitch and several other men assist him.
   Spilled gasoline ignites causing an explosion. During the escalating
   fire, Melanie and others rush out. More gulls attack, and Melanie takes
   refuge in a telephone booth. Mitch rescues her and they get back inside
   the restaurant. A distraught woman blames Melanie for the attacks,
   claiming they began with her arrival.

   Mitch and Melanie go to Annie's house to fetch Cathy. They find Annie's
   body outside, killed by the crows while protecting Cathy. That night,
   Melanie and the Brenners barricade themselves in the family home, which
   is attacked by waves of birds that nearly breach the boarded-up doors
   and windows. During a lull, Melanie investigates a fluttering sound in
   the attic. After discovering that the birds have pecked their way in
   through the roof, they violently attack Melanie, trapping her until
   Mitch pulls her out. Melanie is badly injured and traumatized; Mitch
   insists they all drive to San Francisco to get Melanie to a hospital.
   As Mitch readies Melanie's car for their escape, a menacing sea of
   birds has quietly gathered around the Brenner house. The car radio
   reports bird attacks on nearby communities such as Santa Rosa and the
   military may intervene. Cathy retrieves her lovebirds (the only birds
   who do not attack) from the house and joins Mitch and Lydia as they
   carefully escort Melanie past a mass of birds and into the car. The car
   slowly drives away as thousands of birds are ominously perching.
