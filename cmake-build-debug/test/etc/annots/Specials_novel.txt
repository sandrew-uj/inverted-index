   The third novel in the Uglies series begins two months after events in
   Pretties, when Tally Youngblood has become a member of an elite group
   of "Specials" - surgically enhanced super-humans - called the Cutters.
   The Cutters were founded by Shay, who invented the use of ritual
   self-harm to become "bubbly" and clear-headed in spite of brain lesions
   used to make her pretty-minded. All of the specials in this group were
   able to get rid of the brain lesions on their own, and now live in the
   wild. They were adopted into Special Circumstances and given enhanced
   senses, strength and reflexes, and are among the youngest agents
   working for Dr. Cable.

   The Cutters disguise themselves as Uglies in order to crash a party in
   Uglyville and search for members of the New Smoke. Tally successfully
   finds a girl giving out pills which cure the pretty lesions, which she
   encourages the Uglies to take to the Crims - Tally and Shay's old
   clique. The Cutters attempt to capture the girl, but she escapes on a
   hoverboard with David's help. Giving chase, the Cutters are ambushed by
   Smokies with unusually advanced technology, including infra-red masking
   sneak suits and electrical weapons. The Smokies kidnap Fausto, one of
   the Cutters, and leave Shay and Tally injured.

   Hearing that the pills are intended for Zane, Tally insists on going to
   see her boyfriend, who suffered brain damage in New Pretty Town and has
   been hospitalized since Tally turned Special. Tally discovers that
   while Zane is free of the pretty lesions, his brain has been damaged
   and his physical infirmity now disgusts her.

   She begins to wonder if she received a brain operation when being made
   Special which has given her feelings of superiority.

   Eager to show Dr. Cable that Zane is cured so that he will be made
   Special, Shay and Tally break into the city Armory to steal something
   to cut off Zane's tracking necklace. They succeed, but in the attempt,
   they accidentally destroy much of the Armory, putting the city on high
   alert. Then, they begin to secretly track Zane and the Crims as they
   journey to the New Smoke, although the pair split up when Tally
   receives a guide to the New Smoke from her friend Andrew Simpson Smith,
   an escapee villager from a reservation of primitive culture. Shay
   follows the guide straight to the Smoke, but Tally insists on staying
   with Zane.

   On the journey, Zane notices Tally and confronts her about her reasons
   for following him. The pair kiss, but Tally is still repulsed by Zane's
   tremors and runs away from him. Tally continues to follow the group to
   the New Smoke - a city called Diego, which accepts runaways freely,
   having widely adopted the pretty cure and rejected the rules about
   surgery, allowing anyone to look how they please rather than following
   the international standard. Tally is amazed by this, but horrified to
   hear that Diego is beginning to expand into the wild, clear-cutting
   forest like the Rusties did.

   Tally finds Fausto at a party for newly arrived runaways, but realizes
   his Special brain surgery has been cured. He had given informed consent
   before he became special to take a "cure" for having a special brain.
   Tally only just escapes being forcibly injected. Her escape attempt
   leaves her helpless, as she jumps off a cliff with only crash bracelets
   to catch her fall. She is picked up by Diego's authorities and locked
   up for her lethal strength and weapon-sharp teeth and fingernails,
   which they insist on removing. The doctors inform her that she has
   received brain surgery to give her flashes of anger and euphoria, along
   with feelings of superiority, although they will not change this
   without her consent. With Shay's help, Tally escapes just before the
   surgery begins.

   Shay and the other Cutters have all been cured by Fausto, but they want
   Tally's help to protect Diego from imminent attack by Dr. Cable, who is
   blaming the so-called New System for the attack on the armory. Tally
   assists in the evacuation of the hospital, but learns after the attack
   that Zane, having just received surgery to cure his tremors, died of
   complications during the confusion of the attack. Grief-stricken, Tally
   leaves immediately to tell Dr. Cable the truth about the attack on the
   armory. Just before she reaches the city, she meets David, who took a
   helicopter to talk to her in time. He tells her that he still believes
   she can think her own way out of her brain surgery, but gives her an
   injector full of the cure so that she has the option of curing herself.

   Arriving at Special Circumstances headquarters, Tally finds that Dr.
   Cable and the Specials have taken control of the city. Dr. Cable knows
   that Tally was responsible for the attack, but has chosen to use the
   attack as a way to seize control over both this city and Diego. Tally
   tricks Dr. Cable into stabbing herself on the injector, and is
   imprisoned underground for a month, watching the feeds as Dr. Cable
   slowly loses her grip on the city and the cure begins to spread. Diego
   publishes scans of Tally's Special body, calling her a "morphological
   violation," and the world is outraged by Dr. Cable's "secret"
   experiments on unconsenting teenagers.

   Eventually, Tally is taken as the last remaining Special to be
   "despecialized," but she resists the surgeons and breaks out with Dr.
   Cable's help, becoming the only true Special left. She returns to
   David, still waiting at the Rusty Ruins, and realizes that her other
   friends have all found their places in the New System. She decides that
   she wishes to remain in the wild, free from surgery, and with David she
   will form the "New Special Circumstances," ensuring that nature is
   protected from humanity's excesses.
