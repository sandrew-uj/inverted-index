   The book is set in Portland, Oregon, in the year 2002. Portland has
   three million inhabitants and continuous rain. It is deprived enough
   for the poorer inhabitants to have kwashiorkor, a protein deprivation
   from malnutrition. Although impoverished, the culture is similar to the
   1970s in the United States. There is also a massive war in the Middle
   East. Climate change reduces quality of life.

   George Orr, a draftsman and addict, abuses drugs to prevent "effective"
   dreams that change reality. After one of these dreams, the new reality
   is the only reality for everyone else, but George retains memory of the
   previous reality. Under threat of incarceration, Orr undergoes
   treatment for his addiction.

   George attends therapy sessions with ambitious psychiatrist and sleep
   researcher William Haber. Orr claims he has the power to dream
   "effectively". Haber, gradually believing the evidence, seeks to use
   George's power to change the planet. His experiments with a
   biofeedback/EEG machine, nicknamed the Augmentor, enhance Orr's
   abilities while producing a series of increasingly intolerable
   alternative worlds based on an assortment of utopian (and dystopian)
   premises:
     * After Haber directs George to dream a world without racism, the
       skin of everyone on the planet becomes a uniform light gray.
     * Eliminating over-population is disastrous after George dreams a
       devastating plague eliminates most humans.
     * George dreams "peace on Earth", resulting in an alien invasion of
       the Moon and uniting everybody against the potential threat.

   Each effective dream gives Haber more wealth and status until he is
   effectively ruler of the planet. Orr's finances also improve, but he is
   unhappy with Haber's meddling and just wants to let things be.
   Increasingly frightened by Haber's lust for power and delusions of
   divinity, Orr contacts lawyer Heather Lelache to represent him against
   Haber. He falls in love with Heather but is unsuccessful in getting
   released from therapy.

   George tells Heather the "real world" was destroyed during nuclear war
   in April 1998. George dreamed it back into existence as he lay dying in
   the ruins. He doubts the reality of what now exists, hence his concern
   for Haber's efforts to improve it.
   Portland and Mount Hood play a central role in the setting of the novel

   Heather is present for one of the sessions, allowing her to remember
   two realities: one where her husband died early in the Middle East War
   and another where he died just before the truce because of the aliens.
   She tries to help George but also tries to improve the planet; when she
   suggests to a dreaming George that the aliens should no longer be on
   the Moon, they invade the Earth instead. In the resultant fighting,
   Mount Hood is bombed and the 'dormant' volcano produces a spectacular
   eruption.

   After that disaster, George dreams about peaceful aliens. For a time,
   everybody experiences stability, but Haber continues meddling. His
   suggestion George dream away racism results in everyone becoming gray;
   Heather's parents are different races, so she never existed in that
   alternative reality. George dreams a gray version of her with a milder
   personality, the two marry. Mount Hood continues to erupt, and he is
   concerned the planet is losing coherence.

   After speaking with one of the aliens, Orr suddenly understands his
   situation and confronts Haber. In their final session, Haber "cures"
   George of his ability to dream effectively by suggesting George dream
   that his dreams no longer affect reality. Haber has become frustrated
   with Orr's resistance and used his research from studying George's
   brain during his sessions to give himself the same power. Haber's first
   effective dream represents a significant break with the various
   realities created by Orr, and threatens to destroy reality. Orr shuts
   off the Augmentor as coherent existence is dissolving into
   undifferentiated chaos. The world is saved, but exists now as a mix of
   random elements from several realities. In this version, George works
   at a kitchen store operated by one of the aliens. Haber survives, his
   mind shattered by his knowledge of unreality, and only exists because
   George's dreams restored him. Heather is also restored, though she is
   left with only a slight memory of George. George is resigned to the
   loss of the Heather he loved, but resolves to romance the one that
   exists now. The story ends as the two have coffee, while his
   inscrutable alien employer observes.
