   The film takes place in a single day and night. The film opens with the
   two main characters, Harry (Anthony Edwards) and Julie (Mare
   Winningham), meeting at the La Brea Tar Pits and immediately falling in
   love. After spending the afternoon together, they make a date to meet
   after her shift ends at midnight at a local coffee shop, but a power
   failure means Harry's alarm fails to wake him and Julie leaves for
   home.

   When Harry awakes that night he realizes what has happened and rushes
   to the shop, arriving at 4 AM. Harry tries to call Julie on a payphone,
   but only reaches her answering machine, where he leaves an apology.
   When the phone rings moments later he picks it up, hearing a frantic
   man named Chip telling his father that war is about to break out in
   less than seventy minutes. When Harry finally gets a chance to talk and
   asks who is calling, Chip realizes he has dialed the wrong area code.
   Chip then pleads with Harry to call his father and apologize for some
   past wrong before he is being confronted and presumably shot. An
   unfamiliar voice picks up the phone and tells Harry to forget
   everything he heard "and go back to sleep" before disconnecting.

   Harry, confused and not entirely convinced of the reality of the
   information, wanders back into the diner and tells the other customers
   what he has heard. As the patrons scoff at his story, one of them, a
   mysterious businesswoman named Landa (Denise Crosby), calls a number of
   politicians in Washington on her wireless phone and finds that they are
   all suddenly heading for "the extreme Southern Hemisphere". After Harry
   tells her some launch codes that Chip told him, she verifies that they
   are real and, convinced of the danger, immediately charters private
   jets out of Los Angeles International Airport to a compound in a region
   in Antarctica with no rainfall. Most of the customers and staff leave
   with her in the owner's delivery van. When the owner refuses to make
   any stops, Harry, unwilling to leave without Julie, arranges to meet
   the group at the airport and jumps from the truck.

   Harry is helped and hindered by various strangers, who are initially
   unaware of the impending apocalypse. In the process he inadvertently
   causes several deaths and is deeply shaken by that, yet still he goes
   on. When he finds Julie and later tells her, she notes that there is no
   confirmation of the attack. Desperate to reach the airport and not
   having a car, Harry finds a helicopter pilot (Brian Thompson) and tells
   him to meet them on the roof of the Mutual Benefit Life Building, where
   Landa ordered a helicopter and a large amount of supplies to be
   delivered. Julie has also tried to find a pilot on her own, and in the
   moments it takes to find her, Los Angeles descends into violent chaos.
   There is still no confirmation any of this is real, and Harry wonders
   if he has sparked a massive false panic in the example of Chicken
   Little. However, when he uses a phone booth to contact the father of
   the man who called him (using the number of the booth and the area code
   the man was trying to use), he reaches a man who says his son is a
   soldier. Harry tries to pass on the message he was given, but the man
   hangs up before Harry finishes.

   When they reach the top of the Mutual Benefit building they find the
   pad empty, and the roof manned only by Landa's drunk co-worker (Kurt
   Fuller). Any doubts about a false alarm are eliminated when a missile
   can be seen streaking across the sky. As they fear the end, the
   helicopter suddenly returns with the pilot badly wounded but fulfilling
   his promise to come back for them. After they lift off from the roof,
   several warheads hit and the nuclear electromagnetic pulse from the
   detonations causes the helicopter to crash into the La Brea pits. As
   the helicopter sinks and the cabin fills with natural asphalt tar,
   Harry tries to comfort a hysterical Julie by saying someday they will
   be found and they will probably be put in a museum, or maybe they will
   take a direct hit and be turned into diamonds. Julie, accepting her
   fate, calms down and takes comfort in Harry's words, and the movie
   fades out as the tar fills the compartment. A final explosion seems to
   imply a direct hit has taken place.
