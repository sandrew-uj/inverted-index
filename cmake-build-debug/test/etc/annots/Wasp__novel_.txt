   Set in an unspecified time in the future (^[2]book states 500 years),
   the plot centres on protagonist James Mowry and an inter-planetary war
   between humans (collectively referred to as "Terrans") and the Sirians
   (collectively referred to as the Sirian Empire, from Sirius). The war
   has been in effect for nearly a year as the story begins. The Terrans,
   while technologically more advanced in most respects to the Sirians,
   are outnumbered and out-gunned by a factor of twelve-to-one.

   The Sirians are a humanoid species that share many of the same physical
   characteristics as their Terran enemies. Some of the more noticeable
   differences are their purple-faced complexions, pinned-back ears, and a
   bow-legged gait. In terms of government, the Sirian Empire is
   reminiscent of fascist states that existed in the Second World War;
   they frequently employ a much-feared secret police force named the
   Kaimina Tempiti, or Kaitempi; they censor much of their media, and they
   actively seek to quell any opposition to the government or the war
   through the use of violence and intimidation.

   The novel begins by introducing James Mowry as he is being recruited by
   the Terran government to infiltrate enemy lines; to become a "wasp," in
   the sense portrayed in the opening passages of the novel. His
   recruitment is somewhat less than voluntary: Mowry is offered the
   alternative of conscription and assignment to the front. His dossier
   states that he can be counted on to do anything, provided the
   alternative is worse. So persuaded, he accepts the assignment.

   Notwithstanding the method of persuasion, Mowry is an ideal recruit,
   having spent the first seventeen years of his life living under the
   Sirian Empire. After extensive linguistic and cultural training and
   surgery designed to make him appear to be Sirian, he is sent to the
   Sirian outpost world of Jaimec to begin his mission. The first phase of
   his mission involves placing stickers with subversive slogans all over
   the Jaimecan towns in the hope of beginning to create the first
   murmurings of confusion and concern in Sirian society.

   Completing his first objective, Mowry begins the second: sending
   letters to various people of importance informing them of several
   deaths by his hand. These threats are always signed by a mythical rebel
   organisation named Dirac Angestun Gesept (Sirian Freedom Party) and
   often emblazoned by the slogan, "War makes wealth for the few, misery
   for the many. At the right time, Dirac Angestun Gesept will punish the
   former, bring aid and comfort to the latter."

   Following this, Mowry moves on to phase three, the hiring of Sirian
   civilians as contract killers to kill prominent members of the Kaitempi
   and other government officials. With the Sirians becoming more
   concerned about the disruption they believe the D.A.G. is causing,
   Mowry's success allows him to move on to phase four of his plan.

   The fourth phase involves Mowry planting fake wire tapping devices on
   several buildings (including the Kaitempi headquarters) to engender
   paranoia. He also continues to spread rumours via Sirian civilians to
   plant other seeds of doubt among the populace.

   With a Terran invasion imminent, Mowry is told to skip to phase nine of
   his operation: the sabotaging of Jaimecan sea-ships in another effort
   to divert the Sirians' concern away from the real - and approaching -
   threat. This time, the Terrans strike and the invasion begins. Mowry is
   captured by a Terran spaceship and is held for a few days before a
   government man recognises that he is not Sirian, but Terran. The novel
   ends with a government man informing Mowry that a wasp on another world
   has been captured, and that he is the replacement.
