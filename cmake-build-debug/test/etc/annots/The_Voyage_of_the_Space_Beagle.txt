   The main protagonist of the novel is Dr. Elliott Grosvenor, the only
   Nexialist on board (a new discipline depicted as taking an actively
   generalist approach towards science). It is Grosvenor's training and
   application of Nexialism rather than the more narrow-minded approaches
   of the individual scientific and military minds of his other shipmates
   that consistently prove more effective against the hostile encounters
   both from outside and within the Space Beagle. He is eventually forced
   to take control of the ship using a combination of hypnotism,
   psychology, brainwashing, and persuasion, in order to develop an
   effective strategy for defeating the alien entity Anabis and saving the
   ship and our galaxy.

   The book can be roughly divided into four sections corresponding to the
   four short stories on which it was based:

   In the first section, the Space Beagle lands on a largely deserted
   desolate planet. Small scattered herds of deer-like creatures are seen,
   and the ancient ruins of cities litter the landscape. Coeurl, a
   starving, intelligent and vicious cat-like carnivore with tentacles on
   its shoulders, approaches the ship, pretending to be an unintelligent
   animal, and quickly infiltrates it. The creature kills several crewmen
   before being tricked into leaving the now spaceborne ship in a
   lifeboat. It then commits suicide when it realizes it has been
   defeated.

   In the second part, the ship is almost destroyed by internal warfare
   caused by telepathic contact with a race of bird-like aliens, called
   Riim. The benign signals that the Riim send are incompatible with the
   human mind. Only Grosvenor's knowledge of telepathic phenomena saves
   the ship from destruction.

   In the third section, the ship comes across Ixtl, a scarlet being
   floating in deep space. It is a vicious survivor of a race that ruled a
   previous universe before the Big Bang, the creation of our own
   universe. Ixtl boards the ship, and being obsessed with its own
   reproduction, kidnaps several crew members in order to implant
   parasitic eggs in their stomachs. It is eventually tricked into leaving
   the ship, after all the crew have left the ship temporarily, leaving no
   prey left for its offspring to feed on.

   In the last section, Anabis, a galaxy-spanning consciousness, is
   encountered. Once again, it is both malevolent, starving and
   aggressive, and under all circumstances must be prevented from
   following the ship back to any other galaxy. Anabis, which is
   essentially a galaxy-size will-o'-the-wisp, feeds off the death of
   living organisms, and has destroyed all intelligent life in its galaxy.
   It transforms all planets it can find into jungle planets through
   terraforming, since it is these kind of worlds that produce most life.
   The crew of the Space Beagle lures the intelligence to chase the ship
   into deep space, causing it to starve to death.

   Running concurrently to this, the book also covers a power struggle on
   the ship among the leaders of individual scientific and military
   groups.
