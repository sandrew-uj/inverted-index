   "Those meddling kids" and their Mystery Machine are at the center of a
   well-meaning experiment gone wrong and they will need to bring all of
   their mystery solving skills to bear (along with plenty of Scooby
   Snacks), to find a cure for a world full of mutated creatures infected
   by a nanite virus that enhances their fears, terrors, and baser
   instincts.
