   The First Doctor and his companions Ben and Polly arrive in the TARDIS
   at the South Pole in the year 1986. Nearby they find the Snowcap Base,
   a space tracking station commanded by General Cutler. The base is
   supervising the mission of the Zeus IV spaceship, running a routine
   probe on the Earth's atmosphere. The spaceship is drawn off-course by
   an unknown force, and Snowcap monitoring staff discover a new, unknown
   planet approaching Earth. Recognising identical landmasses to those of
   Earth, the Doctor reveals that this is Mondas, the Earth's long-lost
   twin planet, and that its inhabitants will soon be visiting Earth.

   A mysterious spaceship lands in the snow and three robotic creatures
   emerge. They kill the guards and infiltrate Snowcap Base, taking
   control. They reveal that they are Cybermen, a race who, though once
   like human beings, have gradually replaced their bodies with mechanical
   parts, and eliminated the "weakness" of emotion from their brains. The
   Cybermen prevent the base staff from saving the Zeus IV, and it is
   destroyed by the gravitational pull of Mondas. The emotionless Cybermen
   state that the lives of the crew are irrelevant to them. The Cybermen
   explain that Mondas is absorbing energy from Earth and will soon
   destroy it. They propose to take humans back to Mondas and turn them
   into Cybermen.

   General Cutler, the Snowcap base personnel and the Doctor's companions
   mount a resistance to the Cybermen, overpowering them and killing them
   with their own cyberweapons. Cutler plans to destroy Mondas using a
   Z-bomb, one of a series of powerful nuclear bombs that are placed at
   strategic points around the world, and contacts Space Command HQ in
   Geneva. The chief scientist Dr. Barclay expresses concerns that the
   radiation caused by the exploding planet would cause immense loss of
   life on Earth, and Ben argues that Mondas might destroy itself anyway
   when it absorbs too much energy. Suddenly, the Doctor collapses from
   exhaustion.

   Faced with dissent, Cutler orders Ben to be imprisoned in a cabin with
   the Doctor. Ben escapes and, together with Barclay, sabotages the
   Z-bomb rocket. Cutler attempts to fire the Z-bomb, but the engines fail
   on the launchpad. When Cutler threatens to kill Ben, Barclay, and the
   Doctor, who has now regained consciousness, he is killed by a new
   squadron of Cybermen. The Doctor, realising that Mondas is approaching
   destruction, attempts to mediate with the Cybermen, offering them a
   home on Earth. The Cybermen take Polly and the Doctor back to their
   spaceship as hostages.

   As the Cybermen take over Space Command in Geneva, the Doctor realises
   that their plan is to destroy the Earth with the remaining Z-bombs,
   thus saving Mondas. The Cybermen order the humans to disarm the Z-bomb
   and send Ben, Barclay, Haines and Dyson into the bomb chamber. Ben
   surmises that the reason the Cybermen send humans to do this work is
   that the Cybermen are highly susceptible to radiation. Using
   radioactive rods from the reactor chamber as a weapon against the
   Cybermen, Ben and the crew regain control of the base. Just as more
   Cybermen enter the Tracking Room, Mondas explodes. Disconnected from
   their power source on Mondas, all the remaining Cybermen die. Geneva
   Space Command contacts the base to announce that the Cyberman threat
   has ended.

   Ben frees the Doctor and Polly from the Cybermen's spaceship. The
   Doctor seems to be very ill, and abruptly departs. Trapped outside the
   TARDIS in the snow, Ben and Polly plead for help. Though weak, the
   Doctor seizes enough energy to open the door from the console room and
   rescues Ben and Polly. The Doctor collapses from old age and transforms
   into the Second Doctor.
