   In the Raven Tower universe, many gods of varying levels of power
   exist. Anything that a god says becomes true; speaking a paradox may
   injure or kill a god. Gods may take the physical forms of animals or
   landmarks. The story is narrated by The Strength and Patience of the
   Hill, a god who inhabited a large boulder and later a millstone.
   Strength and Patience also discusses its long life, from prehistoric
   times through the arrival of humans. The country of Iraden is protected
   by various gods, including the Raven. The port city of Vastai is ruled
   by the Raven's Lease, a human who is granted vast power in exchange for
   a shortened lifespan. When the Raven's possessed bird dies, the Lease
   must die as well.

   Mawat, son of the Lease and commander of Iraden's army, receives a
   message that his father is ill. Mawat is accompanied by his retainer, a
   transgender man named Eolo. When they arrive in Vastai, Mawat's father
   has disappeared and his uncle Hibal is the new Lease. Mawat publicly
   accuses Hibal of foul play, threatening Vastai's stability and trade
   relationships with other territories. In particular, members of the
   Xulhan Empire and their snake god are seeking a new alliance with
   Hibal.

   Eolo discovers that Mawat's father is being held prisoner in the
   dungeons of the Raven Tower. He also discovers that Strength and
   Patience has been enslaved by the Raven. Strength and Patience has been
   protecting Vastai while the Raven's power has secretly been weakening.
   Mawat, believing he is serving the Raven, inadvertently frees Strength
   and Patience from the Raven's control. Mawat is then framed for
   murdering a high-ranking politician. A flood causes a dysentery
   outbreak and hostile forces begin invading, revealing that the Raven is
   no longer able to protect Vastai. Mawat kills Hibal and is then killed
   by the snake god. Strength and Patience states that he has killed the
   Raven. He vows to protect Eolo, but decides to leave Vastai to its
   fate.
