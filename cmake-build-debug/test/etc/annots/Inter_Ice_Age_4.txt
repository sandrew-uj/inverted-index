   Plot elements include submersion of the world caused by melting polar
   ice, genetic creation of gilled children for the coming underwater age,
   and a fortune-telling computer predicting the future and advising
   humans how to deal with it.^[3] Because a similar computer in Moscow is
   being used to make political forecasts, the institute of a Tokyo
   professor decides to avoid politics and try to foresee the future of an
   individual. A man is picked, apparently at random, only to be murdered
   before he can be programmed, but the computer can still read his mind.
   The resulting involvements are complicated by a climatic shift - Inter
   Ice Age 4 - that puts Earth underwater.
