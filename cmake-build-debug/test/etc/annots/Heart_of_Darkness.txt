   Aboard the Nellie, anchored in the River Thames near Gravesend, Charles
   Marlow tells fellow sailors how he became captain of a river steamboat
   for an ivory trading company. As a child, Marlow was fascinated by "the
   blank spaces" on maps, particularly Africa. The image of a river on the
   map particularly fascinated Marlow.

   In flashback, Marlow makes his way to Africa, taking passage on a
   steamer. He departs 30 mi (50 km) up the river where his company's
   station is. Work on a railway is going on. Marlow explores a narrow
   ravine, and is horrified to find himself in a place full of diseased
   Africans who worked on the railroad and are now dying.

   Marlow must wait for ten days in the company's Outer Station, which
   strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation. He meets the company's chief
   accountant, who tells him of a Mr. Kurtz, who is in charge of a very
   important trading post, and a widely respected, first-class agent. The
   accountant predicts that Kurtz will go far.
   Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889

   Marlow departs with sixty men to travel on foot about 200 miles
   (320 km) to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to
   captain is based. After fifteen days, he arrives at the station only to
   learn that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident. He meets the
   general manager, who informs him that he could not wait for Marlow to
   arrive because the up-river stations had to be relieved, and tells him
   of a rumour that Kurtz is ill. Marlow fishes his boat out of the river
   and spends months repairing it. At one point Marlow is invited into the
   room of the station's brickmaker. Hanging on the wall is "a small
   sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded
   carrying a lighted torch". Marlow is fascinated with the sinister
   effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that
   Mr. Kurtz made the painting a year earlier. The brickmaker predicts
   Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy, before telling Marlow that, "The same
   people who sent him specially also recommended you."

   Marlow is frustrated by the time it takes to perform the repairs,
   delayed by the lack of tools and replacement parts. He learns that
   Kurtz is resented, not admired, by the manager. Once underway, the
   journey to Kurtz's station takes two months.
   The Roi des Belges ("King of the Belgians"--French), the Belgian
   riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889

   The journey pauses for the night about 8 miles (13 km) below the Inner
   Station. In the morning the boat is enveloped by a thick fog. The
   steamboat is later attacked by a barrage of arrows, and the helmsman is
   killed. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the
   attackers away.

   After landing at Kurtz's station, a man boards the steamboat: a Russian
   wanderer who strayed into Kurtz's camp. Marlow learns that the natives
   worship Kurtz, and that he has been very ill of late. The Russian tells
   of how Kurtz opened his mind and seems to admire Kurtz even for his
   power and his willingness to use it. Marlow suggests that Kurtz has
   gone mad.

   Marlow observes the station and sees a row of posts topped with the
   severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager
   appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz. The
   area fills with natives ready for battle, but Kurtz shouts something
   from the stretcher and the natives retreat. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to
   the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins. The manager tells Marlow
   that Kurtz has harmed the company's business in the region, that his
   methods are "unsound". The Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the
   company wants to kill him, and Marlow confirms that hangings were
   discussed.
   Arthur Hodister (1847-1892), who Conrad's biographer Norman Sherry has
   argued served as one of the sources of inspiration for Kurtz

   After midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has returned to shore. He
   finds Kurtz crawling back to the station house. Marlow threatens to
   harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm, but Kurtz only laments that he had
   not accomplished more. The next day they prepare to journey back down
   the river. The natives assemble on shore and begin shouting
   unintelligibly. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter
   the crowd of natives.

   Kurtz's health worsens during the trip and Marlow becomes increasingly
   ill. The steamboat breaks down, and while stopped for repairs, Kurtz
   gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and
   a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When
   Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; Marlow hears him
   weakly whisper, "The horror! The horror!" A short while later, the
   "manager's boy" announces to the rest of the crew that Kurtz has died.
   The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury
   "something" in a muddy hole. He falls very ill, himself near death.

   Upon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the
   "civilised" world. Several callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz
   entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows
   they have no interest in. He gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for
   publication if he sees fit. Marlow is left with some personal letters
   and a photograph of Kurtz's fiancee. When Marlow visits her, she is
   deep in mourning although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's
   death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's
   final words. Marlow tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.
