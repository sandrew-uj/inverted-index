   The fantasy story takes place in Whitby and concerns the evil sorcerer
   Reverend Obadiah Demurral who is seeking two powerful amulets, called
   the Keruvim, which he plans to use to control the elements and dominate
   the world. At the start of the book he purchases the first Keruvim
   (which takes the form of a golden statuette of a cherub) from an
   Ethiopian mercenary named Gebra Nubera.

   He then uses the Keruvim to destroy a ship upon which the next Keruvim
   is prophesied to arrive, but when he surveys the wreckage he finds
   nothing.

   The next day an Ethiopian boy named Raphah arrives searching for the
   Keruvim. He befriends the main character, an urchin named Thomas and
   reveals that he is a messenger from God (referred to as Riathamus
   here), and that Demurral is a Shadowmancer, a sorcerer who can control
   the dead. Despite not believing in God, Thomas agrees to assist Raphah
   in regaining the Keruvim because he wants revenge on Demurral for
   evicting him and his dying mother from their home.

   They pursue Demurral and the Keruvim with the assistance of Thomas's
   tomboy friend Kate and the mysterious smuggler, Jacob Crane. During the
   story, Raphah, Kate and Jacob Crane, who all for their own individual
   reasons did not believe in God, do come to believe in him.

   Eventually it is revealed that, in using the Keruvim, Demurral has
   unleashed a demonic race called the Glashan who were imprisoned at the
   dawn of time for rebelling against God. Led by the evil Pyratheon (the
   Devil), they join forces with Demurral so that they can find the other
   Keruvim and harness its power to overthrow God and rule the universe.

   It is eventually revealed that Raphah is the other Keruvim, so Demurral
   and Pyratheon try to capture him, so that they can kill him and turn
   him into an Azimuth (a slave spirit) to activate the Keruvim's full
   power.

   At the climax of the story Thomas, Kate and Raphah meet an angel
   referred to as a Seruvim (a play on the word Seraphim) named Raphael,
   who goes by the alias Abram Rickards. A showdown takes place in
   Demurral's church during which Raphah is killed and Pyratheon obtains
   the Keruvim. He recites the incantation to activate its power and the
   world is temporarily plunged into night. Pyratheon thinks he has
   succeeded in stealing the power of God and gloats. However Abram then
   reveals that while Raphah is dead it has no power and all Pyratheon has
   done is meddle with time. After Abram restores life to Raphah, the sun
   rises, Abram is revealed in his true form and Pyratheon and Demurral
   flee.

   Abram tells Thomas, Kate and Jacob Crane to take the Keruvim away to
   another land so they leave aboard Crane's ship, The Magenta. However,
   in the closing page of the book it is revealed that they are being
   stealthily pursued by sea-demons known as Seloth.
