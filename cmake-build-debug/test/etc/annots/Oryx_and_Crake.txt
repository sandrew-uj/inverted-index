   The novel focuses on a character called "Snowman", living in a
   post-apocalyptic world near a group of primitive human-like creatures
   whom he calls Crakers. Flashbacks reveal that Snowman was once a boy
   named Jimmy who grew up in a world dominated by multinational
   corporations and privileged compounds for the families of their
   employees. Near starvation, Snowman decides to return to the ruins of a
   compound named RejoovenEsense to search for supplies, even though it is
   overrun by dangerous genetically engineered hybrid animals. He concocts
   an explanation for the Crakers, who regard him as a teacher, and begins
   his foraging expedition.

   In Snowman's recollection of past events, Jimmy's family moves to the
   HelthWyzer compound, where his father works as a genetic engineer.
   Jimmy meets and befriends a brilliant science student named Glenn.
   Jimmy begins to refer to him as Crake when he uses that name in an
   online trivia game called Extinctathon. Jimmy and Crake spend much of
   their leisure time playing online games, smoking "skunkweed", and
   watching underground videos such as live executions, graphic surgery,
   Noodie News, frog squashing, and child pornography.^[3]^[4]^[5] During
   one of their child pornography viewings, Jimmy is very much lovestruck
   by the gazing eyes of a young girl seen in the porn.

   After graduating from high school, Crake attends the highly respected
   Watson-Crick Institute, where he studies advanced bioengineering, but
   Jimmy ends up at the loathed Martha Graham Academy, where students
   study humanities, only valued for their propaganda applications. Jimmy
   gets a job writing ad copy, while Crake becomes a bioengineer at
   RejoovenEsense. Crake uses his prominent position to create the
   Crakers, peaceful, gentle, herbivorous humanoids, who have sexual
   intercourse only during limited polyandrous breeding seasons. His
   stated purpose for the Crakers, actually a deliberate deception, is to
   create "floor models" of all the possible options a family could choose
   in the genetic manipulation of their future children. Crake's
   bio-engineering team consists of the most expert players gathered from
   the online Extinctathon community.

   Crake tells Jimmy about another very important project, a Viagra-like
   super-pill called BlyssPluss, which also promises health and happiness,
   but secretly causes sterilization in order to address overpopulation.
   Crake officially hires Jimmy to help market it. At the Rejoov compound,
   Jimmy eventually sees a human in the Craker habitat and recognizes her
   as the girl from the pornographic video. Unaware of Jimmy's obsession
   with her, Crake explains that her name is Oryx and that he has hired
   her as a teacher for the Crakers. Oryx notices Jimmy's feelings for her
   and makes herself sexually available to him, despite also being Crake's
   romantic partner. As their relationship progresses, Jimmy becomes
   increasingly fearful that Crake has found out about it. He also makes a
   promise to both Oryx and Crake that he will look after the Crakers if
   anything happens to them.

   After Crake's wonder drug BlyssPluss is widely distributed, a global
   pandemic, deliberately caused by it, breaks out and begins wiping out
   the human race and causing mass chaos outside of the protected Rejoov
   compound. Realizing that this was planned by Crake all along, and
   sensing that something dangerous is happening regarding Crake and Oryx,
   Jimmy grabs a gun to confront Crake, who is returning with Oryx from
   outside the compound and needs Jimmy to let them in. Crake presents
   himself to Jimmy with his arm around an unconscious Oryx, saying that
   he and Jimmy are immune to the virus. Jimmy lets them in, whereupon
   Crake slits Oryx's throat with a knife. Jimmy then immediately shoots
   Crake dead.

   During Snowman's journey to scavenge supplies, he cuts his foot on a
   sliver of glass and becomes infected. He returns to the Crakers' camp
   and learns that three other humans are camping nearby. Snowman follows
   the smoke to their fire. Snowman is unsure of whether and how to
   confront them, but makes a decision.
