   The series follows the story of 17-year-old Canadian high school
   outcast Josh Wheeler, who is searching for his missing British
   girlfriend Sam Dean in post-apocalyptic Glendale, California. He is
   joined by a ragtag group of misfits, including 10-year-old pyromaniac
   Angelica and Josh's former high school bully Wesley, who is now a
   pacifist would-be samurai. Josh tries to survive among the hordes of
   Mad Max-style gangs (evil jocks, cheerleaders turned Amazonian
   warriors, etc), adults who have turned into zombie-like creatures
   called Ghoulies, and the mysterious Baron Triumph.
