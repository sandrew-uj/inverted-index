   The story begins shortly before the wedding of Michael Crawford, a
   doctor. The night before he marries Julia, he inadvertently places his
   wedding ring in the hand of a statue in a garden. When he goes to
   retrieve it, he discovers the statue has mysteriously vanished.

   Despite this mysterious event, the wedding proceeds. Julia's disturbed
   twin sister Josephine serves as the maid of honor. The next morning,
   Crawford awakes to discover Julia's horribly mutilated corpse next to
   him in the bed. Knowing he will be suspected of murdering his bride,
   Crawford flees to London and passes himself off as a medical student.
   He meets John Keats, who is also studying medicine. One day while
   visiting the wards they encounter the grief-stricken Josephine, who
   attempts to shoot Crawford to avenge her sister. A mysterious
   apparition saves him.

   Keats does his best to help Crawford understand what has happened. By
   placing the wedding ring on the statue Crawford unwittingly attracted
   the attention of one of the nephilim, who now considers herself
   Crawford's true wife. The nephilim killed Julia so she could have
   Crawford for herself. Keats, who has some experience with the nephilim,
   recommends that Crawford visit the Alps. There is a place high in the
   mountains where he may be able to free himself from "the stress of her
   regard".

   While traveling on the Continent, Crawford is called upon to assist
   another Englishman who is suffering from a seizure. The man is Percy
   Shelley, and is accompanied by Lord Byron, John Polidori, and Claire
   Clarmont. Byron and Shelley are also connected to the nephilim, which
   they see as both a blessing and a curse. The nephilim can prolong the
   lives of humans and serve as muses who help to inspire great works of
   creativity, but they are extremely jealous and will destroy anyone they
   see as a rival. Crawford and the two poets make their way up the
   Jungfrau, where it is said one might be able to break the bond with a
   nephilim. After answering a version of the Riddle of the Sphinx
   Crawford manages to free himself from his "wife". In doing so he also
   learns more about the nature of the nephilim.

   Yet the danger is not over for Crawford, the poets, and their loved
   ones. The nephilim are still active, and developments in Venice may
   threaten all humanity. Crawford, Josephine, Shelley, and Byron, all
   haunted by personal tragedy, must find a way to save themselves and the
   rest of the world from the nephilim.
