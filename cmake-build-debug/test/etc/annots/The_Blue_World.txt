   Sklar Hast, the protagonist, had achieved a measure of success and
   prosperity by passing his examination to be a "Hoodwink", or semaphore
   tower operator - a prestigious position on the Blue World, a planet
   with no land at all. During the space of twelve generations, the
   descendants of a crashed prison ship have created a rudimentary
   civilization on the water-covered planet, living on huge sea plants.
   They also have no idea that their ancestors were criminals, believing
   them to have been the victims of oppressors. They have evolved a
   peaceful society, and ignore the hints in texts saved from the first
   generation of what their origins actually were.^[2]

   The world is mostly safe. However, they must beware the kragen, giant,
   semi-intelligent squid-like predators which roam the ocean. The
   colonists eventually develop a relationship with one of these, King
   Kragen. It drives off other kragen in return for offerings of food
   organized by an entrenched quasi-religious priesthood built up over
   generations. King Kragen grows to become the largest and most powerful
   kragen, demanding more and more food as time goes by.

   When Sklar questions the need to continue to worship and feed this
   predator, King Kragen appears, wrecks his home and kills his mentor.
   Rather than regard this as divine punishment, Sklar suspects that the
   conservative priesthood has enough control over King Kragen to kill
   those who oppose their views, and to thus uphold their privileged
   status.

   Sklar's mission is to convince his fellow citizens that they must kill
   King Kragen in order to be free. And, if so, to discover how can they
   do it in a world without materials to make weapons.
