   Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Trillian, and Zaphod Beeblebrox leave the
   planet Magrathea on the Heart of Gold. A Vogon ship bribed by Gag
   Halfrunt and a group of psychiatrists fearful that the discovery of the
   Ultimate Question will end their profession intercepts and fires at
   them. Meanwhile, Arthur gets frustrated that the ship is unable to
   produce any beverages beyond an undrinkable tea-like sludge and gives a
   lengthy description of tea, causing Eddie the Shipboard Computer to
   become jammed and unable to fight the Vogon ship off. Desperate, Zaphod
   decides to hold a seance to call up his great-grandfather Zaphod
   Beeblebrox the Fourth to rescue them. The elder Zaphod scolds his
   descendant and sends him on a quest to find The Ruler of the Universe
   in order to solve the political and economic stability plaguing the
   universe. He transports Zaphod and Marvin to Ursa Minor Beta, the
   tropical home planet of the offices of the Hitchhiker's Guide's
   publisher Megadodo Publications, and leaves the others on the ship in a
   black void.

   Acting on a thought from the portion of his brain unaffected by his
   lobotomy, Zaphod goes looking for Zarniwoop, the Guide's lead editor,
   though his staff insist he has been out on an intergalactic cruise. A
   man named Roosta takes Zaphod to Zarniwoop's offices just as Frogstar
   fighters attack the building and tow it to their home planets, Frogstar
   World B, a planet which collapsed through an economic process called
   the "Shoe Event Horizon" which rendered its economy unable to support
   any enterprises besides shoe stores. The planet eventually became the
   site of the Total Perspective Vortex, a device that drives those that
   experience it mad due to showing them their insignificant contributions
   to the infinite universe. Following Roosta's instructions and escaping
   through Zarniwoop's office's windows, he is caught by Gargravarr, a
   disembodied mind who appears to Zaphod in the form of a large bird, and
   takes him to be exposed to the Vortex. However, Zaphod is unfazed by
   the Vortex, suggesting to a perplexed Gargravarr that it showed him
   that he was the most important being in the universe.

   Left to his own, Zaphod eventually finds a long-abandoned spaceliner
   whose passengers have been forcibly kept in 900 years of suspended
   animation by the autopilot after the collapse of their civilization
   until a new one could develop to load the ship with lemon-coated paper
   napkins. On the ship he discovers Zarniwoop, who reveals Zaphod stepped
   into a computer simulation of the universe when he walked into his
   office, allowing Zaphod to survive the Vortex since the universe was
   designed for his benefit. Zarniwoop further reveals that the ship had
   been microscopically shrunk an placed in Zaphod's pocket so that they
   can use it to find the true ruler of the universe, who he has located.
   However, Zaphod abandons Zarniwoop; reunites with Ford, Arthur, and
   Trillian; and escapes to the nearest restaurant. This turns out to be
   the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, built atop the ruins of
   Frogstar World B and existing in a time bubble near the end of the
   universe, which it offers its guests spectacular views of. At the
   restaurant they meet Zaphod's old acquaitance Hotblack Desiato, a
   member of the rock band Disaster Area, which is known for making the
   loudest sound in the universe and only perform their concerts remotely
   from a distant spaceship. During their dinner, Zaphod receives a
   telephone call from Marvin, who has been stranded on the planet for
   billions of years and is now working as a valet in the restaurant's
   parking lot.

   Knowing Zarniwoop will track them down, Zaphod suggests they leave,
   trying to steal Desiato's sleek, all-black limoship. When the ship
   suddenly starts going back in time with them on board, an agitated
   Zaphod admits that he still wants to solve the Question to the Ultimate
   Answer. Marvin abruptly tells them that the question is imprinted in
   Arthur's brainwaves, but they are distracted before they can ask
   further. They discover that the limoship is actually an unmanned stunt
   ship for Disaster Area, which is programmed to fall into a local sun to
   create solar flares in synchronization with the climax of the band's
   concert. They discover a partially installed emergency teleporter
   without a guidance system, and Marvin reluctantly volunteers to stay
   behind and operate it so the others can escape. Zaphod and Trillian
   find themselves back aboard the Heart of Gold under Zarniwoop's
   control; he forces them to use the ship's Improbability Drive to take
   them to the Ruler of the Universe. On an unpopulated planet, they find
   the Ruler is an old man that has no idea he is the ruler, is not aware
   of a broader universe outside of his home, and is even skeptical if
   anything around him exists. While an enraged Zarniwoop tries to reason
   with the Ruler, Zaphod and Trillian strand him and make their escape in
   the Heart of Gold.

   Meanwhile, Arthur and Ford find themselves aboard Ark Fleet Ship B,
   which is loaded with 15 million passengers from the planet
   Golgafrincham and is commanded by an inept captain who is only
   concerned with taking baths. Although the Golgafrinchans were
   obstensibly evacuated to escape a planetary disaster, in actuality the
   disaster was made up by the Golgafrinchans to divest themselves of a
   useless portion of their population, later going extinct from a
   pandemic caused by dirty telephone receivers after they expelled all
   telephone sanitizers. The Ark crash-lands onto a swamp on an
   undeveloped planet. Arthur and Ford leave to search for a signal from a
   space ship, traveling for hundreds of miles around the continent. Along
   the way the planet's primitive yet friendly hominid-like inhabitants
   usher away from their home settlements and leave them fruit. After
   finding a glacier with a Magrathean inscription honoring
   Slartibartfast, they realize they are on pre-historic Earth in
   2,000,000 BC, that the hominids are Neanderthals, that they have
   traveled across Europe from the future site of Arthur's home city of
   Islington in Great Britain to Norway, and that the Golgafrinchans are
   the ancestors of the modern human race.

   They return to the Golgafrinchans, only to find that they have been too
   preoccupied with trying to form council meetings about
   documentary-making, fiscal policy, searching for hot springs for the
   captain's baths, and warfare to bother with trying to discover fire,
   invent the wheel, or solve pressing issues. Ford and Arthur also find
   that the Golgafrinchans have been killing the Neanderthals. Ford tries
   to warn them that they will be annihilated in 2 million years, but they
   ignore him. Desperate, Arthur tries to teach the surviving Neanderthals
   through a makeshift Scrabble set. When one of the Neanderthals spells
   out the word "forty-two" with the letter tiles, Ford realizes that the
   Neanderthals were part of the matrix of Deep Thought's computer to
   determine the Ultimate Question and that the Golgafrinchans are
   interfering with the machination by displacing them. However, they also
   remember Marvin's claim that the Ultimate Question was embedded in
   Arthur's mind. Hoping that remnants of the programming exist in
   Arthur's subconscious, they have Arthur pull out tiles at random from
   the Scrabble set, only to discover that the Question is "What do you
   get if you multiply six by nine?" Ford thinks this explains why the
   universe is a giant "cock-up", and the two resign to make the best of
   their life on prehistoric Earth. They go on a date with two
   Golgafrinchan women, and Arthur throws his copy of the Hitchhiker's
   Guide in the river.
