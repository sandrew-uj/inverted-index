   Bobby had grown up in a home in suburban Cleveland, Ohio during the
   1960s and 1970s where partying and drugs were a recurring theme. He has
   already witnessed the death of his mother and beloved older brother by
   the time he befriends Jonathan, who comes from a sheltered family.
   After Bobby finds his father is dead, Jonathan's family takes him in.

   Bobby and Jonathan become best friends, and also experiment sexually.
   The two eventually lose touch, but meet up again in their 20s in 1980s
   New York, where Bobby moves in with Jonathan and his eccentric roommate
   Clare. Clare had planned to have a baby with Jonathan (who is openly
   gay), but Bobby and Clare become lovers, while Jonathan still has
   feelings for Bobby. Clare and Bobby have a baby and move to a country
   home together with Jonathan.

   The trio form their own family, questioning traditional definitions of
   family and love, while dealing with the complications of their
   polyamourous relationship.
