   Through a cosmic fluke, humans are the only species in the universe
   with genuine musical talent. As a result, when anthropologists from the
   intergalactic Refined League discover human music in 1977, the
   aesthetic shock revolutionizes their society (with 1977 becoming the
   Year Zero of their new calendar, thus the title), and quintillions of
   Refined citizens spend decades obsessively listening to hundreds of
   thousands of human songs. However, Refined law on cultural heritage
   mandates that the artworks of a given species must be enjoyed in
   contexts defined by that species--and human law on file sharing has
   established that the fine for illicit copies of songs is up to $150,000
   per individual copy per song. As a result, the Refined consider
   themselves to be so deeply in debt to humans ("three trillion
   yottadollars") that--compared to bankrupting the entire
   universe--humanity's extinction might be preferable.
