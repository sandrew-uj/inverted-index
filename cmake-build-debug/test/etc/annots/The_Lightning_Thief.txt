   The Lightning Thief is narrated in the first person past tense by Percy
   Jackson, a twelve-year-old diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD.^[P 1]
   While on a school trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the
   chaperones, Mrs. Dodds, turns into a Fury and attacks him.^[P 2]Percy's
   favorite teacher, Mr. Brunner, lends Percy a magical sword-pen to
   defeat her. After school lets out, Percy goes on a trip to Long Island
   with his mother, Sally. In the middle of the night, Percy's friend
   Grover Underwood reveals himself as a satyr and tells them they are in
   danger. The three drive to a mysterious summer camp, but the Minotaur
   attacks them, grabs Sally, and causes her to disappear in a blinding
   flash of gold light. Believing his mother has died, Percy kills the
   beast with one of its own horns, drags an unconscious Grover into the
   camp, and soon falls unconscious himself. When Percy awakens, he learns
   that the camp is called Camp Half-Blood and that he is a demigod: the
   son of a human and a Greek god. He settles into camp life and meets
   several other demigods, including Luke Castellan and Annabeth Chase.
   After a hellhound attacks him after a game of Capture the Flag, he is
   saved by Chiron and then claimed by his father, the god Poseidon.
   Chiron explains to Percy how the three eldest male gods--Poseidon,
   Zeus, and Hades--swore an oath not to have children more than 70 years
   ago; Percy represents a violation of the oath. He is the second
   violation of the oath, as the first was Thalia Grace, daughter of Zeus.
   She ended up being killed by monsters which were sent by Hades, as Zeus
   had broken the oath. This, coupled with the fact that Zeus's master
   lightning bolt has recently been stolen, has bred much suspicion
   between the gods.

   Percy is given the task of locating Zeus's original lightning bolt
   before an all-out war can break out between the gods. He chooses
   Annabeth and Grover to accompany him to the realm of Hades, as Hades is
   the most likely culprit of the theft. Before he leaves, Percy is given
   Chiron's magic sword Anaklusmos ("Riptide") and Luke's flying sneakers.
   The trio travels towards Los Angeles, where the entrance to Hades's
   realm resides. Along the way, they are attacked by several monsters,
   including the Furies, Medusa, Echidna, and the Chimera. They also do a
   favor for the god Ares, who gives them a backpack full of supplies and
   safe transportation to Nevada. Percy gradually learns more about his
   companions, his powers, and the world of the Greek gods. When they
   arrive in Hades's realm, Grover is nearly dragged into Tartarus by
   Luke's flying shoes. The battered group finally meets Hades, who
   reveals that his Helm of Darkness has also been mysteriously stolen,
   and accuses Percy of stealing it. Hades threatens to kill Sally Jackson
   (who is being held hostage by the god) and reanimate the dead unless
   his helm is returned. When Percy finds the missing master bolt inside
   Ares's backpack, the group realizes they've all been manipulated by
   Ares. Narrowly escaping the Underworld, Percy challenges Ares to a duel
   on the beach. After a long and tough fight, Percy wins, and he gives
   the Helm of Darkness to the Furies. Hades realizes that Percy is not
   the thief of the helm nor the master bolt, and returns Mrs. Jackson to
   their apartment in New York.

   Percy takes the master bolt back to Zeus on Mount Olympus, who rewards
   the young hero by not killing him. Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood as
   a hero and enjoys the rest of his summer there. On the last day of
   camp, however, he goes into the woods with Luke, who reveals himself to
   be the real thief of Hades's Helm and Zeus's bolt, following the orders
   of Kronos. Kronos also manipulated the power-hungry Ares into taking
   part in the scheme. Luke explains his beliefs that the gods are too
   irresponsible and are poor leaders who need to be overthrown. He offers
   Percy the chance to join him, and when Percy refuses, Luke tries to
   kill him with a scorpion. Percy manages to kill it but is badly
   poisoned and faints. When he has awakened and recovered, Percy is given
   the choice of whether to return home for the school year or stay at
   camp year-round. After much thought, he decides to spend the school
   year with his mother, even though it will be more dangerous for him
   with Luke and Kronos on the loose. Grover and Annabeth also leave the
   camp for the year but promise to keep in touch with
   Percy.^[1]^[10]^[11]
