   Conan falls in with Cengh, a priest of the Suddah Oblates, who is
   conveying a jewel known as the Source of Light back to his temple.
   Unfortunately, his talisman is coveted by a necromancer, Neg the
   Malefic, who plans on raising an army of undead warriors with the
   jewel's magic. When an agent of Neg murders Cengh and steals the jewel,
   Conan seeks vengeance for his friend. Joining forces with a warrior
   woman, Elashi, and a beautiful zombie, Tuanne, Conan tracks the
   murderer back to his master. They overcome numerous menaces on the
   journey towards Neg's stronghold, including the Men With No Eyes,
   henchmen of the One With No Name, and a swarm of spiders. Finally,
   Conan faces and kills Neg himself in a great battle.
