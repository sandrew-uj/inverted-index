   City of Illusions takes place on Earth, also known as Terra, in the
   future, twelve hundred years after an enemy named the Shing has broken
   up the defunct League of All Worlds and taken up residence on Earth.
   The indigenous inhabitants of Earth have been reduced to small
   communities that are widely separated, living in highly independent
   rural communes, or in nomadic tribes. The Shing control the human
   population by using various strategies of indirect manipulation, which
   include divide and rule, as well as deceptive telepathic mental
   projection, known as mind-lying. In contrast, innately truthful
   telepathy is known as mindspeech.

   Prior to the opening scene, the main character, who is a descendant of
   the protagonists in Planet of Exile, has been involved in a ship crash,
   and since the Shing do not believe in killing, has had his memory
   erased and been abandoned in the forest; this leaves his mind as a
   blank slate or tabula rasa. As the story begins he must develop a new
   self-identity ex nihilo.
