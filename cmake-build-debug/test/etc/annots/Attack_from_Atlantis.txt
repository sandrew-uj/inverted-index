   At age seventeen, Don Miller is already an accomplished electronics
   technician, helping his uncle, Dr. Edward Simpson, with the testing of
   a new kind of submarine, the Triton I. Accompanied everywhere by his
   dog Shep, a schipperke, he has assumed that he would be aboard the boat
   for its sea trials, though he mans the communications gear on the
   surface support ship during the submarine's first test run somewhere
   south of Puerto Rico. That test run is commanded by Dr. Oliver Drake,
   who designed the submarine's new nuclear propulsion system. The test
   run is successful, in spite of some problems with the control systems
   and stress on certain crew members that has made them believe that they
   have seen, on the television screens that give a view of the outside of
   the submarine, men encased in form-fitting bubbles.

   For the full test run the Triton will descend into the Milwaukee Deep,
   north of Puerto Rico. Because the United States Navy has taken an
   interest in Triton and has partly funded her development, the
   commanding officer on the test run will be Admiral Robert Haller.
   Dexter, the president's science advisor, and Senator Kenney are to
   accompany the crew as observers. Another of the observers going along
   is Sid Upjohn, a reporter. As they descend they find that they are
   losing control of the boat and, further, that they are being rammed by
   a whale. Unable to maneuver, they come down on an undersea plateau,
   twelve hundred fathoms (7200 feet) below the surface. Again they catch
   glimpses of men encased in bubbles, something that should be
   impossible. Emerging from the submarine in a bathysuit, Don makes the
   necessary repairs and the Triton leaves the plateau to head for the
   surface.

   Now the bubble-men attack openly in full force, cementing rocks to
   Triton's hull to drive her down again. Again the crew bring their boat
   down on the plateau where they had stopped for repairs. Again Don
   prepares to go out in the bathysuit to remove the rocks, but the
   bubble-men, which the crew have taken to calling Atlanteans, have
   sealed the hatch through which the bathysuit must emerge. As the crew
   watches helplessly through their closed-circuit televisions, the
   Atlanteans attach thick ropes to the submarine and then bring in
   ichthyosaurs that have evolved to breathe water to tow the boat off the
   plateau. As they pull Triton deeper, the Atlanteans envelope the boat
   in a forcefilm bubble, obliging the navigator, Kayne, to shut down the
   engines. Even with the boat being towed, without power, the helmsman,
   Paul Cavanaugh, continues to steer the boat to give them a smoother
   ride.

   Three miles below the surface they come to a town of about 20,000
   people that they call Atlantis. Lying under a larger version of the
   bubbles that enclose the people surrounding the submarine, the town is
   illuminated by some phosphorescent substance. There Triton is towed
   through the forcefilm dome that covers the town and into a pool large
   enough to accommodate her. Then the Atlanteans break into the boat and
   take the crew prisoner, knocking them out with some kind of electric
   stungun.

   Don regains consciousness in a cell where he meets Muggins, an American
   whom the Atlanteans had rescued from a ship sunk in the war, fifty
   years previously. Muggins tells Don that the people call their town
   Mlayanu and he introduces him to K'mith, the president of Mlayanu. Don
   discovers that K'mith, his family, and several other Atlanteans speak
   English, having learned it from Muggins in order to read the books that
   they find in sunken ships and to understand the radio messages that
   they pick up occasionally through a floating antenna.

   Because Shep resembles the dog-god that the more superstitious
   Atlanteans worship, it is decided that Don and Shep will live with
   K'mith and his family. In K'mith's home he meets K'mith's wife and
   twelve-year-old daughter and his nephew S'neifa, the son of his
   deceased older brother K'mayo, who had rescued Muggins. As Don gets
   settled into K'mith's house, S'neifa tells him how an outcast European
   tribe, some 28,000 years ago, made some accidental discoveries that
   enabled them to live underwater and develop the Atlantean civilization.
   Because he's under eighteen, the Atlanteans assume that Don is
   uneducated, but S'neifa suspects and then confirms the truth. He then
   gives Don a copy of a radio message that the Atlanteans have picked up:
   it tells Don that the garbled distress call from Triton had been
   misinterpreted and that the United States has accused another country
   of capturing the submarine.

   Later Don goes for a walk with Shep and finds the building where the
   town's dome is created and controlled open and unguarded. Sneaking
   around inside the building, he discerns how the system works and he
   takes a discarded diagram as he leaves. That evening he takes the
   diagram to show to Dr. Drake and his uncle. Little can be gleaned from
   the diagram, but the men do discern that the forcefilm could protect a
   city from a nuclear attack. Returning to K'mith's house, Don tells
   K'mith of the discovery, but K'mith already knows about it. As for
   Don's plea to let the Triton and her crew return to the surface, K'mith
   shows Don another intercepted radio message: the United States and the
   country it had accused of taking the Triton have exchanged ultimatums
   and nuclear war is less than a week away.

   That night S'neifa brings Don a bubble suit so that he can free the
   Triton's crew from the small bubble-dome in which they are imprisoned.
   At a certain signal S'neifa will activate the forcefilm bubble around
   Triton so that she can escape her confinement in Mlayanu. All goes well
   until several fights break out. Kayne and Senator Kenney reach the
   submarine, board her, and give the signal. S'neifa activates the
   forcefilm and Kayne takes the boat out of Mlayanu, leaving Don and the
   rest of the crew behind to be recaptured. Later Kayne and Kenney are
   brought into the jail, having been recaptured just after reaching the
   surface.

   Kept in a cell separate from the rest of Triton's crew, Don asks
   Muggins to bring him some metal tubing and tools so that he can make a
   tin whistle to pass the time. He then makes an ultrasonic dog whistle,
   which he uses to call Shep. After several incidents when Shep comes at
   his call the dog is chained up and then begins to howl when Don calls
   him. An angry mob forces K'mith and the dome technicians to allow Don
   to designate the dome-control building as the dog-god's shrine. Don
   then uses a signal generator that he had retrieved from Triton to
   modulate the current creating the dome forcefilm, causing a loud hum
   and salt rain to come from the dome and terrify the mob. Don then
   discovers that K'mith has had his own agenda which meshes perfectly
   with what Don had intended: the Atlanteans have been unable to find any
   more of the crystals that they need and he had hoped that scientists on
   the surface world might be able to make more. Don assures him that they
   can and will. Thus Don and the crew of the Triton are released and the
   Triton, fitted with a forcefilm that will allow the boat's engines to
   run when it is turned on, leave Myalanu with K'mith and S'neifa aboard.
