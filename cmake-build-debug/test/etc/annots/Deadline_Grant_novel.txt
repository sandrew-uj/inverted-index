   Deadline is set several decades after the zombie apocalypse, the
   Rising. Two man-made viruses (cures for cancer and the common cold)
   combined to form Kellis-Amberlee, a normally beneficial virus that, on
   the death of any host mammal over 40 pounds (18 kg) (and sometimes
   spontaneously, before that mammal's death), "goes live" or "amplifies",
   and turns them into a zombie. Most humans reside in controlled zones,
   with rigorous blood testing and decontamination used to stop the live
   KA virus from spreading. Bloggers, in this universe are respected,
   credentialed journalists (generally divided up as the fact-based
   "Newsies", the Steve Irwin-inspired "Irwins", and the entertaining
   "Fictionals") providing news and entertainment. A year after the events
   of Feed, Shaun Mason is still coming to terms with having had to kill
   his infected sister, Georgia, and has stepped back from his role as an
   Irwin to head After the End Times, in an administrative role.

   After returning to Oakland, California, after a field excursion with
   Rebecca "Becks" Atherton (Shaun's replacement as the site's top Irwin),
   Alaric Kwong (a Newsie), and Dave Novakowski (another Irwin), Shaun
   receives a visit from Dr. Kelly Connolly, a Centers for Disease Control
   (CDC) researcher. Kelly had faked her death using a clone after her
   colleagues, researching the abnormally high death rate among people
   with "reservoir conditions" (in whom the active virus is present but
   confined to one part of the host's body, a condition Georgia had while
   alive), began dying at a suspiciously high rate: actions possibly
   linked to the conspiracy uncovered in the previous book. As they
   discuss this, a sizable zombie outbreak occurs; Dave overrides the
   lockdown so the others can escape but dies when the site is firebombed.

   The team flees to Weed, California, where Magdalene "Maggie" Garcia,
   billionaire pharmaceutical company heiress and head Fictional at After
   the End Times, lives. They track down a non-CDC laboratory in Portland,
   Oregon and head there to learn more about Kelly's findings. A rogue
   researcher, Dr. Shannon Abbey, reveals that reservoir conditions are an
   immune response to the virus, and those with the conditions may fight
   off zombification. Shaun and Becks then head to Portland's CDC office,
   where they escape a zombie outbreak staged to kill them. The group next
   returns to Maggie's, and Shaun sends the collected data to Mahir Gowda
   (a British resident and the website's head Newsie), hoping he can find
   independent verification.

   A fortnight later, Mahir arrives unannounced with news that all
   Kellis-Amberlee substrains were lab-engineered, and people with
   reservoir conditions are being killed off before each new substrain
   appears. Armed with this information, Shaun leads Kelly, Becks, and
   Mahir to the CDC office in Memphis, Tennessee, to break in and confront
   Kelly's boss, Joseph Wynne. Dr. Wynne reveals he organised the Oakland
   outbreak to kill Kelly and the bloggers; he is part of a widespread
   conspiracy to keep people afraid and compliant while the zombie virus
   is stabilised. In the following struggle, Dr. Wynne is killed, and
   Kelly is infected with the live virus. She sacrifices herself to
   distract security while the others escape. The team heads back to
   California, driving through a hurricane and finding most of the country
   deserted.

   On reaching Maggie's, Shaun and company learn that most of the country
   has been locked down following massive outbreaks along the Gulf Coast:
   a Second Rising. Shaun figures out that the cause is not an airborne
   strain of live virus as most fear, but it is now being transmitted by
   mosquitoes. He confirms this with Dr. Abbey and receives an offer to
   join her in Shady Cove, Oregon. Shaun and Mahir organise the rest of
   the site's staff to propagate what they have learned, before those at
   Maggie's evacuate. Shortly before reaching Shady Cove, Shaun is
   attacked and bitten, and is quarantined in Abbey's lab. Despite several
   tests, he shows no sign of becoming a zombie. The novel's coda reveals
   that despite her apparent death, Georgia is somehow alive and well in
   an unknown CDC facility.
