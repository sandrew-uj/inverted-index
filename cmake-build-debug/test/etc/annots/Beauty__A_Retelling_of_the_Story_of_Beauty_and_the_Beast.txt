   Roderick Huston, a wealthy merchant and widower, has three daughters;
   Grace, Hope, and Honour. When Honour was a child she asked what her
   name meant and afterwards said she'd rather be named Beauty, a nickname
   which soon stuck. As she grows older, she feels the nickname is
   increasingly ill-fitting, as she remains plain while her sisters become
   lovelier and more socially adept. Grace becomes engaged to Robert
   Tucker, one of her father's ship captains, and Hope to a blacksmith
   named Gervain Woodhouse. When all of Huston's ships are lost at sea,
   Robert is presumed dead and the family become destitute. Gervain, who
   has decided to return to his home town in the countryside to become the
   new blacksmith there, makes the offer that they come with him, and they
   agree. After an arduous two-month journey, they arrive at the small
   town of Blue Hill.

   A year passes. The family slowly adapt to their new lives, and Hope and
   Gervain have married and have two children. One day they receive news
   of one of Huston's ships arriving back into port. Huston leaves the
   next day, but not before asking his daughters if they want any gifts.
   Grace and Hope jokingly ask for jewelry and dresses, while Beauty asks
   for a rose cutting or seeds, as none grow in the countryside.

   Huston returns home sooner than everyone expected, with a beautiful
   rose and saddlebags filled with more treasure than they could possibly
   hold. He explains that on his way home through the forest he became
   lost in a storm, and happened across a mysterious castle. Inside, he
   was given shelter and waited on by invisible servants. As he was
   leaving the next day, he found a beautiful rose garden and plucked a
   single rose for Beauty. The owner of the castle, a terrifying beast,
   appeared, furious that Huston would steal from him after his
   hospitality. The Beast agreed to let him go on the condition that one
   of his daughters must return and live in the castle.

   Despite her family's pleas, Beauty insists that she go. As the months
   pass, Beauty comes to enjoy living in the castle. She grows close to
   the Beast, enjoying walks and talks together and spending time in the
   castle's enormous library, but cannot bring herself to love him and
   refuses his marriage proposal every night. She also dreams every night
   of her family in vivid detail and tries to decipher clues about the
   Beast's past when she slowly starts to hear the voices of the two
   invisible maids that wait on her. When Beauty becomes homesick, the
   Beast shows her a magic mirror that allows her to see her family. In it
   she sees Grace agreeing to marry the local minister, despite still
   loving Robert. She also learns that Robert himself has recently
   returned home after years lost at sea, eager to find Grace. Beauty begs
   to visit her home and tell Grace before it's too late, promising to
   return in a week and stay with the Beast forever afterwards. The Beast
   reluctantly allows her to go.

   When Beauty arrives home her family is overjoyed, but quickly become
   disheartened when they learn she's leaving again. During the days
   without the Beast, Beauty begins to recognize how she truly feels about
   him. At her family's pleading she agrees to stay a while longer, but
   quickly rushes back to the castle when she has a dream about the Beast
   dying. Beauty discovers him nearly dead. Realizing her true feelings,
   she confesses her love and tells him that she will marry him. In an
   instant the enchantment on the Beast and the curse is broken.

   The Beast is returned to his handsome human form, explaining to the
   astonished Beauty about a curse on his family's lineage and how it
   could only be broken by someone loving him despite his appearance. He
   shows Beauty her reflection, revealing how she has blossomed into a
   true beauty. Beauty is reunited with her family, and she and the Beast
   start their new lives together.
