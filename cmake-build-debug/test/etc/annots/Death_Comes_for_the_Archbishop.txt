   The narrative is based on two historical figures of the late 19th
   century, Jean-Baptiste Lamy and Joseph Projectus Machebeuf, and rather
   than any one singular plot, is the stylized re-telling of their lives
   serving as Roman Catholic clergy in New Mexico. The narrative has
   frequent digressions, either in terms of stories related to the pair
   (including the story of the Our Lady of Guadeloupe and the murder of an
   oppressive Spanish priest at Acoma Pueblo) or through their
   recollections. The narration is in third-person omniscient style.
   Cather includes many fictionalized accounts of actual historical
   figures, including Kit Carson, Manuel Antonio Chaves and Pope Gregory
   XVI.

   In the prologue, Bishop Ferrand, an Irish bishop who works in the New
   World, solicits three cardinals at Rome to pick his candidate for the
   newly created diocese of New Mexico (which has recently passed into
   American hands). Bishop Ferrand is successful in getting his candidate,
   the Auvergnat Jean-Marie Latour, recommended by the cardinals over the
   recommendation of the Bishop of Durango (whose territory New Mexico had
   previously fallen under). One of the cardinals, a Spaniard named
   Allende, alludes to a painting by El Greco taken from his family by a
   missionary to the New World and lost, and asks for the new Bishop to
   search for it.

   The action then switches to the primary character, Bishop Jean Marie
   Latour, who travels with his friend and vicar Joseph Vaillant from
   Sandusky, Ohio to New Mexico. At the time of Latour's departure for New
   Mexico, Cincinnati is the end of the railway line west, so Latour must
   travel by riverboat to the Gulf of Mexico, and thence overland to New
   Mexico, a journey which takes an entire year (and includes losing most
   of his supplies in a shipwreck at Galveston). The names given to the
   main proponents reflect their characters. Vaillant, valiant, is
   fearless in his promulgation of the faith, whereas Latour, the tower,
   is more intellectual and reserved than his comrade. Vaillant, described
   as being ugly but purpose-filled, is given the nickname "Blanchet"
   ("Whitey") as well as "Trompe-la-morte" ("Death-cheater") for his
   complexion and his numerous instances of bad health, respectively.
   While the narrative speaks of Vaillant positively, it also alludes to
   his willingness to acquire (he "forces the hand" of a landowner into
   giving him and Latour two prize mules, Angelica and Contento, chastises
   the widow Dona Isabella Olivares for refusing to assert her rights
   under her husband's will and thereby blocking the church from its
   testamentary share, and goes on frank "begging trips" to acquire money)
   and near the end of the novel his questionable financial behaviour
   receives an investigation from Rome. Latour, again presented
   favourably, nevertheless does operate with a view to politics: he
   successfully canvasses donations to build a Romanesque cathedral in
   Santa Fe according to his own desires (he chooses the stone and brings
   the architect Molny from France to complete it), and bides his time to
   remove dissenting priests and help a poor Mexican slave-woman named
   Sada until he is in a position of political strength (his help of Sada
   is never described in the novel). The novel ends with the death of
   (retired) Archbishop Latour in Santa Fe: Vaillant has pre-deceased
   Latour as the first Bishop of Colorado after the Colorado gold rush (in
   reality Machebeuf was the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Denver).

   Near the beginning of the novel, Latour and Vaillant are saved from
   being murdered by the villainous Buck Scales (at whose house they have
   sought shelter for the night) by Scales's abused wife Magdalena. All
   three escape, and Scales is hanged for the murder of four of his former
   guests, while Magdalena ultimately serves nuns whom Latour brings from
   Europe and who run a school in Santa Fe. While some of the clergy
   already established in New Mexico are portrayed favourably (such as the
   Padre of Isleta Pueblo, the blind priest Father Jesus de Baca, who
   collects parrots), several of the entrenched priests are depicted as
   examples of greed, avarice, and gluttony. The priest of Albuquerque,
   Father Gallegos, is removed for not being devout enough (he dances and
   enjoys fine food and hunting), replaced by Vaillant. Father Martinez at
   Taos is removed for denying the necessity of priestly celibacy (and
   having children, although he is also described as starting a revolt and
   then profiting from the executions of the rebels to seize their
   property) and his friend Father Lucero at Arroyo Hondo (described as a
   miser) is also removed when he joins Father Martinez's new church
   (Martinez dies an apostate while Lucero receives absolution from
   Vaillant after repenting near death).

   Cather portrays the aboriginal people of the Pueblos, the Hopi and the
   Navajo sympathetically, including a discussion of the Long Walk of the
   Navajo (mentioned as a reminiscence of the dying Latour of his Navajo
   friend Eusabio and the Navajo leader Manuelito). Latour reflects that
   the removal of the Navajos was a wrong comparable to "black slavery,"
   and the narrator describes Kit Carson's actions with the Navajo as
   "misguided" and "a soldier's brutal work." Cather's characters express
   the near futility of overlaying their religion on a millennia-old
   native culture. For example, while caught in a snowstorm with his
   native guide Jacinto (who dwells in the Pecos Pueblo, which in reality
   was already deserted by the time of Lamy), Latour and Jacinto are
   forced to spend the night in a cave sacred to Jacinto's people. Latour
   initially finds a disagreeable smell, and the unexplained actions of
   Jacinto with regard to the place make him uneasy.
