   The story follows Joe Ledger, a Baltimore detective, who is recruited
   into the Department of Military Sciences, a specialized entity of the
   US Government which answers only to the President, to prevent a
   terrorist plot against America. El Mujahid and his associates create a
   prion disease which causes victims to expire, then re-animate with
   minimal brain function; enough to find, attack and infect more people
   with "Seif al Din". Joe Ledger and the Department of Military Sciences
   must stop El Mujahid before he can release his newer and much more
   powerful strain of the pathogen in Philadelphia.
