   In the far future, a small elite group of humans have returned from
   Altair (over 16 light years away) to Earth, their mother planet, to
   live in nine elaborate, high-tech castles as idle aristocrats. They are
   primarily concerned with theoretical discussions of aesthetics, past
   times and questions of honor and etiquette. Their time is spent
   drinking fine wines, socializing at formal dinners, and striving to
   rise in their political standing. Various enslaved alien races provide
   technicians ("Meks"), transportation ("birds", "power wagons"),
   household service ("Peasants"), and amusement ("Phanes"). Only a small
   minority of humans live a free life outside of the castles, and are
   considered barbaric by the castle inhabitants because they perform
   manual labor to serve their own needs.

   After seven centuries during which the noble humans develop an
   increasingly refined society, the Meks revolt. The inhabitants of some
   castles without defenses are immediately killed, while the inhabitants
   of the best defended castles consider the revolt only a nuisance.
   Complacently the humans consider their high-tech castles
   unchallengeable. To take action themselves rather than only planning
   and commanding is seen as a vulgar loss of dignity. Gentlemen in this
   society only do intellectual activity; all technical work or labour is
   seen as beneath them.

   However, without the Meks, the technology of the castles cannot be
   maintained. Furthermore, the Meks use their inside knowledge of the
   operation of the castles to successfully besiege the remaining castles
   until only Castle Hagedorn is left. While most castle citizens value
   their traditions and social customs and standing higher than their own
   survival, one gentleman however, Xanten, takes it upon himself to
   research the situation and search for allies outside of the castle. He
   eventually accepts that he can learn from the "barbaric" free-living
   outsiders and tribes.

   After a short and hard battle, the Meks take over Castle Hagedorn.
   Xanten and his allies win by destroying the Meks' food supply, which
   starves the Meks after several months. When the Meks call for terms,
   Xanten concludes that humanity cannot go on depending on slave labor,
   so they send the surviving Meks back to their native planet, Etamin 9
   and resolve to live off the land and produce their needs by their own
   labor in the future. Castle Hagedorn becomes a museum to the past ways
   of life.
