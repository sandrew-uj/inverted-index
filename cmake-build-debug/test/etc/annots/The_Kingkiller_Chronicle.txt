   The Kingkiller Chronicle is a fantasy book series by Patrick Rothfuss,
   which recounts the story of Kvothe, an adventurer and musician.^[1] The
   book is largely told in a "story-within-a-story" format, where the
   reader learns about the story of Kvothe's life as he narrates it to a
   scribe. The first two books, The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's
   Fear, were released in 2007 and 2011, respectively. Despite a decade
   having passed, the third novel titled The Doors of Stone has not yet
   been released. The two released books have sold over 10 million
   copies.^[2]

   The plot is divided into two different timelines: the present, in which
   Kvothe tells the story of his life to a man known as the Chronicler in
   the Waystone Inn, and Kvothe's past, which makes up the majority of the
   first two books. The present-day interludes are in third person from
   the perspective of multiple characters, while the story of Kvothe's
   life is told entirely in the first person from his own perspective. The
   series also contains many metafictional stories-within-stories from
   varying perspectives, most of which are recounted by Kvothe, having
   been heard from other characters in his past.

   Several TV networks have also negotiated for the rights to create a TV
   series based on the books, whose release date has not yet been
   announced.
