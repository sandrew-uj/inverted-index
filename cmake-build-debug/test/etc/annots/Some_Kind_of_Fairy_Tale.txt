   The novel takes place in Leicestershire, England in current times. Tara
   disappears after meeting a stranger, Hiero, in Charnwood Forest. After
   a long absence, she returns to her parents on Christmas Day.^[5] She
   claims she had been trapped in a parallel reality populated by fairies.
   Tara believes she was missing for only six months, yet her family knows
   she has been gone for 20 years. During her absence Tara has barely aged
   at all, still resembling a 15-year-old girl. But her parents have
   become elderly and feeble, her brother Peter has become a husband and
   father, and her boyfriend Richie has led a life of underachievement and
   substance abuse, unable to recover from Tara's disappearance.^[6]
   Tara's family refuses to accept her explanation for her disappearance.
   Nevertheless, Tara insists it is true. The family employs Dr. Underwood
   to assess Tara's sanity. The psychiatrist concludes she has
   unconsciously fabricated her story as a defense mechanism to avoid
   confronting some trauma that must have occurred during the period of
   her absence.

   Tara becomes increasingly dissatisfied with life with her parents and
   boyfriend, finding it pales in comparison to her supposed experiences
   in the parallel world. Her neighbor, Mrs. Larwood, claims to have had
   the same experience, and warns her of the dangers involved in moving
   between the two worlds.

   Richie is attacked twice by an unknown assailant, and is later stricken
   with brain cancer. Tara believes that this is the work of Hiero, who
   followed her back to the human world and threatened to "blast" Richie's
   mind. At the novel's conclusion Tara once again disappears, leaving a
   note for Richie indicating that her departure was voluntary, and done
   in an effort to protect him from Hiero's revenge.^[7] Richie discovers
   that his cancer has miraculously disappeared.
