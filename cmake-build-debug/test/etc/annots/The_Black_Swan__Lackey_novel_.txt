   Odile von Rothbart is a young sorceress in training under her father's
   tutelage. She adores and respects him, at least in part because he has
   taught her that women are meant to be loyal to men. Living in the
   gardens is the "flock;" the group of young women von Rothbart has
   enchanted because they were unfaithful to their husbands or fathers.
   They are under a curse which compels them to become swans by day and
   women only during moonlit hours. The most beautiful and noble of these
   is Princess Odette, the Queen of Swans.

   Odile is restless because her father seldom praises her, even though
   (or perhaps because) she is growing to be his equal in magic. She has
   never seen much of the world outside her father's estate, but she knows
   she would like the company of other people. She has no interest in the
   swans because they seem to lack her intelligence, and because von
   Rothbart has taught her to despise them.

   When Odette openly defies von Rothbart, challenging him to give a
   convincing reason for his punishment of the flock, he offers her a
   deal; if she can capture and hold the loyalty of a man for an entire
   month, the curse which keeps the flock captive will be broken. A
   condition of the deal is that the young man must know exactly what
   Odette had done (refused the engagement her father had set for her and
   run away with a member of the court) and still pledge his loyalty to
   her. von Rothbart then leads the flock, plus Odile, on a long journey
   to Siegfried's kingdom.

   In the secondary plot, Queen Clothilde is a competent but ruthless
   woman acting as regent for Siegfried. She does not want to surrender
   power to her son when he turns 18; an event mere months away. She plans
   a birthday celebration for him at which six beautiful princesses, all
   prospective brides, will attend, hoping to distract him from his
   kingship. Clothilde secretly hopes to kill Siegfried and either take
   the throne in right or continue as regent for a grandchild. She is
   aided in her scheme by Uwe, her minstrel and former lover.

   Siegfried himself is a womanizer and a scoundrel, but a religious
   experience convinces him to change his ways. Clothilde is dismayed,
   since the reformed Siegfried is winning the respect of her court. Baron
   von Rothbart pays a visit to Clothilde and requests that his own
   daughter be allowed to attend the festival as a potential bride. She
   agrees, tempted by the prospect of having a sorcerer readily at hand.

   The flock arrives at a small lake. Odile, who has largely been in
   charge of their care, is getting to know the swan maidens and feels
   some sympathy for them. She wants Odette to succeed because she thinks
   she and her father would have more freedom to travel if the
   swan-maidens were no longer their burden. Siegfried, sent out hunting
   by his mother in search of swans, encounters Odette, and it is love at
   first sight. His friend Benno, returning to the lake by daylight to
   investigate, is quickly dismissed by Odile. When both men return to the
   lake at night, Odette is able to allay their suspicions that she is
   some sort of witch. She tells Siegfried why she has been cursed, and he
   agrees to marry her and thus break the curse. Happily, Odile tells her
   father that Odette has fulfilled her part of the bargain.

   The next day is the day of the fete where Siegfried will choose his
   bride. Odette leaves the flock in the morning to find him. von Rothbart
   and Odile also attend, Odile having little idea what to expect. Her
   father casts a spell on her which makes her look like Odette and
   controls her with more magic, keeping her from warning Siegfried. The
   Prince declares his desire to marry "the daughter of Baron von
   Rothbart," which breaks the vow he made to Odette. Worst of all, Odette
   arrives just in time to witness this. She flees, Siegfried follows, and
   Odile runs after them both.

   von Rothbart reveals that his aim the entire time has been to deliver
   judgment on Clothilde, since he knew she was plotting to kill her own
   son. He brings part of the Great Hall down on her and Uwe, who lives
   just long enough to reveal the plot to Benno and the court.

   At the lake, von Rothbart taunts Siegfried and Odette, while Odile
   watches from concealment. At a crucial moment, she kills him with his
   own dagger, then rescues Odette and Siegfried, who have jumped into the
   lake to drown together rather than be separated. When the sun rises,
   the girls remain girls, indicating that Rothbart's spell has died with
   him.

   Odette marries Siegfried and gives Odile a position on her council.
   Odile and Benno appear to be falling in love.
