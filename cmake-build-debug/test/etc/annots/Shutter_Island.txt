   In 1954, widower U.S. Marshal Edward "Teddy" Daniels and his new
   partner, Chuck Aule, go on a ferry boat to Shutter Island, the home of
   Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane, to investigate the
   disappearance of a patient, Rachel Solando (who was incarcerated for
   drowning her three children). Despite being kept in a locked cell under
   constant supervision, she has escaped the hospital and the desolate
   island.

   In Rachel's room, Teddy and Chuck discover a code that Teddy breaks. He
   tells Chuck that he believes the code points to a 67th patient, when
   records show only 66. Teddy also reveals that he wants to avenge the
   death of his wife Dolores, who was murdered two years prior by a man
   called Andrew Laeddis, whom he believes is an inmate in Ashecliffe
   Hospital. The novel is interspersed with graphic descriptions of World
   War II and Dachau, which Teddy helped to liberate. After Hurricane
   Carol hits the island, Teddy and Chuck investigate Ward C, where Teddy
   believes government experiments with psychotropic drugs are being
   conducted. While separated from Chuck for a short while in Ward C,
   Teddy meets a patient called George Noyce, who tells him that
   everything is an elaborate game designed for him, and that Chuck is not
   to be trusted.

   As Teddy and Chuck return to the main hospital area, they are
   separated. Teddy discovers a woman (in a sea cave he tried to take
   refuge in) who says she is the real Rachel Solando. She tells him she
   was actually a psychiatrist at Ashecliffe, and when she discovered the
   illegal experiments being run by them, she was incarcerated as a
   patient. She escaped and has been hiding in different places on the
   island. She warns him about the other residents of the island, telling
   him to take care with the food, medication and cigarettes, which have
   been laced with psychotropic drugs. When Teddy returns to the hospital,
   he can't find Chuck and is told he had no partner. He escapes and tries
   to rescue Chuck at the lighthouse, where he believes the experiments
   take place. He reaches the top of the lighthouse and finds only
   hospital administrator Dr. Cawley seated at a desk. Cawley tells Teddy
   that he himself is in fact Andrew Laeddis (an anagram of Edward
   Daniels) and that he has been a patient at Shutter Island for two years
   for murdering his wife, Dolores Chanal (an anagram of Rachel Solando),
   after she murdered their three children.

   Andrew/Teddy refuses to believe this and takes extreme measures to
   disprove it, grabbing what he thinks is his gun and tries to shoot Dr.
   Cawley; but the weapon is a toy water pistol. Chuck then enters,
   revealing that he is actually Andrew's psychiatrist, Dr. Lester
   Sheehan. He is told that Dr. Cawley and Chuck/Sheehan have devised this
   treatment to allow him to live out his elaborate fantasy, in order to
   confront the truth, or else undergo a radical lobotomy treatment.
   Teddy/Andrew accepts that he killed his wife and his service as a US
   Marshal was a long time ago.

   The ending of the novel has Teddy receive a lobotomy in order to avoid
   living with the knowledge that his wife murdered their children and he
   is her murderer.
