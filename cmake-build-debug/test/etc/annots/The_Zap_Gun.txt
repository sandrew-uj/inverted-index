   This novel is set in a then-future 2004. There is still a (theoretical)
   Cold War between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union
   and its allies. At the elite governmental level, however, both "sides"
   have secretly come to an agreement. They have decided that, instead of
   continuing the ecologically and economically crippling nuclear and
   conventional arms race, they will pretend to be constantly developing
   new weapons, which are then "plowshared". This means that these items
   are transformed into novel but baroque consumer products. Most of these
   weapon designers are mediums, who create their new designs in trance
   states. Design of weapons are extracted telepathically from a motion
   comic book, The Blue Cephalopod Man from Titan, created by mad Italian
   artist Oral Giacomini.

   One Wes-Bloc weapons designer, Lars Powderdry (Mr. Lars of Mr. Lars
   Incorporated) is the central character. He is depressed that his
   industry is little more than a fraud, as none of his "weapons" are
   functional, having become fashion items instead. The plowshared
   guidance system of Item 202, a telepathic featureless brazen head named
   Ol' Orville, explains that this depression is merely a projection of
   his own fears of professional and physical impotence. His female
   Peep-East counterpart is Lilo Topchev, whom he knows nothing about, but
   whom Ol' Orville advises him to seduce. He also has a mistress, Maren
   Faine, head of his company's Parisian branch.

   Apart from the comic overtones of this deception, there is a subplot
   related to alien invasion. Sirian aliens invade Earth, and are
   determined to enslave its populace. The aliens' first target is New
   Orleans, which is enshrouded in a "gray curtain of death". Earth has a
   problem, given the deceptive nature of its arms race and the absence of
   functional weapons technology. Lilo immediately tries to kill Lars,
   despite the intentions of their blocs otherwise, but eventually they
   collaborate. Neither can design functional weapons, however.

   There is a further subplot about a conspiracy theorist, who is elected
   as an "average man" to the governing body of Wes-Bloc. The conclusion
   involves an eclectic mixture of time travel, androids, drugs, toys, and
   comic books.
