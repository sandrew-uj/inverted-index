   Hill House is a mansion in a location that is never specified but is
   between many hills. The story concerns four main characters: Dr. John
   Montague, an investigator of the supernatural; Eleanor Vance, a shy
   young woman who resents having lived as a recluse caring for her
   demanding disabled mother;^[4] Theodora, a bohemian artist implied to
   be a lesbian; and Luke Sanderson, the young heir to Hill House, who is
   host to the others.

   Dr. Montague hopes to find scientific evidence of the existence of the
   supernatural. He rents Hill House for a summer and invites as his
   guests several people whom he has chosen because of their experiences
   with paranormal events. Of these, only Eleanor and Theodora accept.
   Eleanor travels to the house, where she and Theodora will live in
   isolation with Montague and Luke.

   Hill House has two caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, who refuse to stay
   near the house at night. The four overnight visitors begin to form
   friendships as Dr. Montague explains the building's history, which
   encompasses suicide and other violent deaths.

   All four of the inhabitants begin to experience strange events while in
   the house, including unseen noises and ghosts roaming the halls at
   night, strange writing on the walls, and other unexplained events.
   Eleanor tends to experience phenomena to which the others are
   oblivious. At the same time, Eleanor may be losing touch with reality,
   and the narrative implies that at least some of what Eleanor witnesses
   may be products of her imagination. Another implied possibility is that
   Eleanor possesses a subconscious telekinetic ability that is itself the
   cause of many of the disturbances experienced by her and other members
   of the investigative team (which might indicate there is no ghost in
   the house at all). This possibility is suggested especially by
   references early in the novel to Eleanor's childhood memories about
   episodes of a poltergeist-like entity that seemed to involve mainly
   her.

   Later in the novel, the bossy and arrogant Mrs. Montague and her
   companion Arthur Parker, the headmaster of a boys' school, arrive to
   spend a weekend at Hill House and to help investigate it. They, too,
   are interested in the supernatural, including seances and spirit
   writing. Unlike the other four characters, they do not experience
   anything supernatural, although some of Mrs. Montague's alleged spirit
   writings seem to communicate with Eleanor.

   Much of the supernatural phenomena that occur are described only
   vaguely, or else are partly hidden from the characters themselves.^[5]
   Eleanor and Theodora are in a bedroom with an unseen force trying the
   door, and Eleanor believes after the fact that the hand she was holding
   in the darkness was not Theodora's. In one episode, as Theodora and
   Eleanor walk outside Hill House at night, they see a ghostly family
   picnic that seems to be taking place in daylight. Theodora screams in
   fear for Eleanor to run, warning her not to look back, though the book
   never explains what Theodora sees.^[6]^[better source needed]

   By this point in the book, it is becoming clear to the characters that
   the house is beginning to possess Eleanor. Fearing for her safety, Dr.
   Montague and Luke declare that she must leave. Eleanor, however,
   regards the house as her home and resists. Dr. Montague and Luke force
   her into her car; she bids them farewell and drives off, but before
   leaving the property grounds she propels the car into a large oak tree,
   and it is assumed that she is killed. In the short, final paragraph
   that follows, the reader is left uncertain whether Eleanor was simply
   an emotionally disturbed woman who committed suicide, or whether her
   death at Hill House has a supernatural significance.
