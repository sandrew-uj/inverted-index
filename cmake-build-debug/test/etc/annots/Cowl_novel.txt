   The novel follows Polly, an ordinary homeless teenager from the near
   future and Tak, a cyborg soldier programmed for obedience to his
   superiors. Tak is tasked to retrieve a "tor", a biological time
   machine, but it attaches itself to Polly and wrenches her back in time
   throughout history toward the eponymous Cowl. She meets several major
   figures in British history but is no closer to discovering the secret
   behind the tor which is leeching off her energy and life. Meanwhile Tak
   runs into Traveler, a time traveler, who shows him the future of the
   human race where the dominant Heliothane race is threatened by the
   Umbrathane uprising and the battles are being fought throughout time
   itself. Cowl, a Heliothane weapon is a human male that was genetically
   engineered to be the perfect specimen of human evolution. However he is
   also on the run from the Heliothane Dominion, which considers him their
   enemy after he slaughters the station he was born at. In an attempt to
   stop the rule of the dominant Heliothanes, Cowl travels back into
   pre-history with an incomprehensibly massive multidimensional creature
   called the Torbeast. The Heliothane theorize that Cowl intends to
   destroy the human race and supplant them with the Umbrathane checking
   on his progress by having the Torbeast send its parasitic scales into
   the future which drag its victims back to Cowl.
