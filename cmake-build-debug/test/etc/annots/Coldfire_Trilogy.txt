   The main events of the Trilogy take place on the fictional planet of
   Erna, colonized 1200 years before the start of the books by a group of
   humans from a future Earth.

   Erna is a primarily hospitable environment; although a planet with
   severe and intense seismic activity, the planet is similar enough to
   Earth to allow for habitability.

   It has, however, another key difference from Earth. The entire surface
   of Erna is wrapped in a powerful energy field known as the Fae. The Fae
   is a type of energy that comes up to the surface from the core of the
   planet via the plethora of volcanoes and earthquakes that rock the
   planet's surface. This is an energy that the native animals of Erna
   sense, and utilize to a small extent to help them survive (i.e. the Fae
   is often able to tell a Sensitive individual when an earthquake is
   coming, or if the tides are about to shift). This energy field that
   encompasses the planet is likened to Earth's magnetic field. Author
   C.S. Friedman explains how if magic existed, it would be a natural
   force governed by consistent rules. "Like fire, it should be useful
   when controlled, dangerous if uncontrolled," she says. "The fact that
   we build windmills does not mean we stop fearing hurricanes."^[1]

   The energy is also sensitive to the human psyche, as the colonists
   discovered to their dismay. The Fae reacts to human cerebral activity,
   bringing to life dreams and manifesting fears. In fact, many of the
   first colonists were killed by Fae-constructs, demons and beasts that
   fed off of their human progenitors, both physically and mentally. It
   was only by a Great Sacrifice, the loss of all the technology and
   knowledge the colonists had brought with them, that humanity came to
   terms with the Fae, at least enough to learn a rudimentary level of
   control over the power.

   For a few hundred years, humanity has managed to eke out a scant
   existence on the harsh surface of Erna, keeping an uneasy balance with
   the Fae. Mankind grows weary of its tumultuous battle with the
   energy-force however, and multiple organizations try to find ways to
   render the human psyche unable to mold the Fae. One of these groups was
   the Church of Human Unification, an organization that sought to bring
   mankind together in prayer to accomplish two things: 1) make the Fae
   recognize man as a regular race on Erna, allowing them to live in
   harmony with the energy, and 2) allow for a human afterlife by bringing
   mankind to the bosom of a God that either already exists, or will be
   made by the power of the faith of man, and the Fae it will mold. This
   Church eventually brought forth a man who would be their salvation and
   damnation, their Prophet, one Gerald Tarrant.
