   Major Scobie lives in a colony on the west coast of Africa during World
   War II, and is responsible for local security during wartime. His wife
   Louise, an unhappy, solitary woman who loves literature and poetry,
   cannot make friends. Scobie feels responsible for her misery, but does
   not love her. Their only child, Catherine, died in England several
   years before. Louise is a devout Catholic. Scobie, a convert, is also
   devout.

   Throughout the novel the oppressive nature of the climate is a major
   backdrop. The heat and humidity act as weakening factors.

   Scobie is passed over for promotion to commissioner, which upsets
   Louise both for her personal ambition and her hope that the local
   British community will begin to accept her. Louise asks Scobie if she
   can go to live in South Africa to escape a life she hates.

   At the same time, a new inspector, named Wilson, arrives in the town.
   He is priggish and socially inept, and hides his passion for poetry for
   fear of ostracism by his colleagues. He and Louise strike up a
   friendship, which Wilson mistakes for love. Wilson rooms with another
   colleague named Harris, who has created a sport for himself of killing
   the cockroaches that appear in his room each night. He invites Wilson
   to join him, but in the first match, they end up quarrelling over the
   rules of engagement.

   One of Scobie's duties is to lead the inspections of local passenger
   ships, particularly looking for smuggled diamonds, a
   needle-in-a-haystack problem that never yields results. A Portuguese
   ship, the Esperanc,a (the Portuguese word for 'hope'), comes into port,
   and a disgruntled steward reveals the location of a letter hidden in
   the captain's quarters. Scobie finds it, and because it is addressed to
   someone in Germany, he confiscates as it might contain secret codes and
   clandestine information. The captain says it's a letter to his daughter
   and begs Scobie to forget the incident, offering him a bribe of one
   hundred pounds when he learns that they share the Catholic faith.
   Scobie declines the bribe and takes the letter, but having opened and
   read it--contrary to regulations--and finding it innocuous, he decides
   not to submit it to higher authorities, and burns it.

   Scobie is called to a small inland town to deal with the suicide of the
   local inspector, a man named Pemberton, who was in his early twenties
   and left a note implying that his suicide was due to a loan he could
   not repay. Scobie suspects the involvement of the local agent of a
   Syrian man named Yusef, a local black marketeer. Yusef denies it, but
   warns Scobie that the British have sent a new inspector specifically to
   look for diamonds; Scobie claims this is a hoax and that he does not
   know of any such man. Scobie later dreams that he is in Pemberton's
   situation, even writing a similar note, but when he awakens, he tells
   himself that he could never commit suicide, as no cause is worth the
   eternal damnation that suicide would bring.

   Scobie tries to secure a loan from the bank to pay the two hundred
   pound fare for Louise's passage, but is turned down. Yusef offers to
   lend Scobie the money at four per cent per annum. Scobie initially
   declines, but after an incident where he mistakenly thinks Louise is
   contemplating suicide, he accepts the loan and sends Louise to South
   Africa. Wilson meets them at the pier and tries to interfere with their
   parting.

   Shortly afterwards, the survivors of a shipwreck arrive after forty
   days at sea in lifeboats. One young girl dies as Scobie tries to
   comfort her by pretending to be her father, who was killed in the
   wreck. A 19-year-old woman named Helen Rolt also arrives malnourished
   and dehydrated, clutching an album of postage stamps. She was married
   before the ship left port and is now a widow with a wedding ring too
   big for her finger. Scobie feels drawn to her, as much to the cherished
   album of stamps as to her physical presence, even though she is not
   beautiful. She reminds him of his daughter.

   He soon starts a passionate affair with her, all the time aware that he
   is committing the grave sin of adultery. A letter he writes to Helen
   ends up in Yusef's hands, and the Syrian uses it to blackmail Scobie
   into sending a package of diamonds for him via the departing
   Esperanc,a, thus avoiding the authorities.

   After Louise unexpectedly returns, Scobie struggles to keep her
   ignorant of his love affair. But he is unable to renounce Helen, even
   in the confessional, where the priest instructs him to think it over
   and postpones absolution. Still, to placate his wife, Scobie attends
   Mass with her and receives communion in his state of mortal sin--a
   sacrilege according to Catholic doctrine. Soon after, Yusef's servant
   delivers a "gift" to Scobie, which he refuses. Scobie's servant, Ali,
   however, witnesses this and a romantic embrace between Scobie and
   Helen. Scobie visits Yusef to confront him about the gift, but also to
   relate his suspicion that Ali, whom he had trusted for all of their 15
   years together, is disloyal. Yusef says he will take care of the
   matter, which within a few hours ends up with Ali being killed by local
   teenagers known as "wharf rats". The reader is led to believe that
   Yusef arranged the killing for which Scobie blames himself.

   Having gone this far down the path of ruin and seeing no way out,
   Scobie decides to free everyone from himself--including God--and plots
   his death by faking a heart ailment and getting a prescription for
   sleeping pills. Knowing full well that suicide is the ultimate
   damnation according to Church doctrine, he proceeds in the end to
   commit suicide with the pills. The act, however, yields ambiguous
   results. Helen continues her dreary existence. And Louise, who knew
   about the affair all along, is made to realise by her suitor, Wilson,
   that Scobie's death was a suicide. She tells Wilson she will not marry
   him, but might in time.

   The concluding chapter consists of a short encounter between Louise and
   her confessional priest. Louise tries to rationalise Scobie's suicide
   in relation to his Catholicism, to which the priest advises that no one
   can know what's in a person's heart or about God's mercy.
