   This episode takes place after the events of the rest of the series. It
   shows the long-term effect of the Interstellar Alliance from the point
   of view of one hundred, five hundred, one thousand, and one million
   years after the founding of the Alliance.
     * 2262: Three viewpoints are debated on an ISN broadcast: pro-Clark
       elements try to paint John Sheridan as a madman, others
       (particularly the outer colonies and Mars) view Sheridan and the
       Babylon 5 forces as liberators, and a third commentator treats
       Sheridan in a neutral fashion.
     * 2362: A live televised debate presents two historians mistakenly
       believing that the role of Sheridan and Babylon 5 in the war
       against the Shadows and overthrowing Clark has been mythologized,
       and that Sheridan was power-hungry. An aged Delenn makes a surprise
       entry to the debate, saying that Sheridan was a good, kind, and
       decent man. She chastises the historians for fabricating "facts" to
       fill in the gaps of their knowledge.
     * 2762: Amid growing tension between the Interstellar Alliance and
       xenophobic elements on Human-settled planets, an anti-Alliance
       faction attempts to set up forged holographic records to show the
       heroes of Babylon 5 to be megalomaniacal war criminals. These
       holograms are based on historical data and recorded memories of the
       original crew, with the forged records overriding their
       personalities. Sheridan is programmed to make an impassioned speech
       about conquering Earth before soon-to-be massacred prisoners and
       Dr. Franklin is programmed to act out a scene showing him talking
       clinically about horrific experiments involving human children and
       alien organs. Before Garibaldi is reprogrammed, he stalls by
       getting the programmer, Daniel, to reveal his faction's plans to
       launch a sneak attack on civilian population centers as the start
       of an all-out war while Garibaldi, who is aware that he is a
       computer program, hacks into the computer network and broadcasts
       the conversation. Before Daniel can turn off the holograms, an
       alarm sounds, indicating an imminent missile attack. Daniel runs,
       knowing that pro-Alliance forces have launched their own attack,
       moments before a nuclear explosion envelops the anti-Alliance
       base.
     * 3262: The resulting war reduced human civilization on Earth to
       sparsely-populated medieval villages. Two monks in an abbey discuss
       the greatly mythologized figures from Babylon 5, with the younger
       monk, Brother Michael, doubting that they even existed. The older
       monk, Brother Alwyn, speculates that the Rangers, prophesied to
       return to Earth someday, would probably operate on Earth in secret.
       When Brother Michael leaves, it is revealed that Alwyn is a Ranger
       himself, showing that the pro-Alliance faction won the war and has
       been slowly and secretly building up Earth civilization to avoid
       the development of resentful, anti-alien factions. A series of
       Roman numerals can be found at the bottom left of the screen
       representing the hidden cameras of the Ranger.
     * One million years later: A man is shown to have watched the above
       archived footage. He instructs his computer to transmit all data to
       New Earth. The computer warns that the sun will go nova soon due to
       atypical solar activity. Before leaving the system, the man
       transforms into an energy-based life-form that enters an encounter
       suit similar to the ones used by the Vorlons. As his ship, with a
       Ranger logo on it, departs the system, the Sun goes nova and is
       destroyed.
     * 2262: John Sheridan and Delenn are discussing everything they have
       done, and if anyone will even remember them in a hundred years.
       They conclude that they probably won't be remembered, but did what
       was right anyway.
