   In 1718, French puppeteer John Chandagnac sails to Jamaica on the
   British ship Vociferous Carmichael. He aims to confront his uncle
   Sebastian, who has apparently stolen a fortune that rightfully belonged
   to John's father and could have prevented his poverty-induced death. On
   board, he meets an Englishwoman named Elizabeth Hurwood, who complains
   that her erudite father Benjamin has abandoned his natural philosophy
   work and begun studying dark magic with her lecherous physician Leo
   Friend. The pirate sloop Jenny menaces the Carmichael, neutralizing its
   powerful cannons with vodun magic. Benjamin Hurwood and Friend begin
   shooting their fellow passengers, revealing them as allies of the
   pirates, as the assailants board and seize the Carmichael.

   The pirates allow the passengers to leave on a rowboat, except for
   Beth, whom Hurwood requires for a vodun ritual, and Chandagnac,
   enrolled into the crew after wounding pirate captain Philip Davies. Not
   fond of long words, the pirates change John's name to Jack Shandy. The
   pirates head for New Providence Island to refit the Carmichael for
   piracy. On the way, they are captured by the Royal Navy, but Shandy
   breaks them out, thus ingratiating himself with the pirates. On New
   Providence, Shandy develops a proficiency for cooking and learns about
   vodun: unlike in the Old World, magic is very strong in the Caribbean,
   and pirates hire bocors to channel loas for healing, attacking and
   protection. Male and female sorcerers control different kinds of magic.
   Shandy also meets a rambling old sorcerer named Sawney, and develops an
   affection for Beth.

   Hurwood has concluded an alliance with Blackbeard to lead him to the
   fabled Fountain of Youth in Florida, a powerful source of magic that
   will make Blackbeard immortal and allow Hurwood to resurrect his late
   wife -- a process which involves evicting Beth's soul from her body.
   Davies and Shandy join him, fighting through a hostile, sentient jungle
   on the way. Davies defends himself from a curse by tossing enchanted
   soil into the air; Shandy takes note and saves some soil for himself.
   Shortly after he returns from the Fountain, Shandy finds that Friend
   has seized the Carmichael and abducted Beth. He gives pursuit in the
   Jenny, and fights off Friend's magical zombie crew, with assistance
   from the ghost ship Nuestra Senora de Lagrimas, which Friend
   accidentally summoned along with the ghost crew. Davies is killed and
   Hurwood takes Beth for himself after defeating Friend in a wizards'
   duel.

   Not knowing where to find Beth, Shandy becomes a drunken wreck and
   accepts the King's pardon from Woodes Rogers, along with most of the
   pirates on New Providence, while Hurwood assumes a new identity as
   Ulysse Segundo and begins pirating. Meanwhile, Blackbeard is killed by
   the Navy, and Shandy receives an education in magic from old Sawney
   (actually a 200-year-old Juan Ponce de Leon) and a vision he gets after
   using the Fountain of Youth soil during a fight. A survivor of
   Segundo's raids relates the mannerisms of his undead crew, and Shandy
   recognizes them as the old Carmichael crew. Hearing that Segundo was
   last seen heading for Jamaica, Shandy sails on the Jenny, facing a
   storm and a mutiny on the way.

   Using Sawney's cryptic tips--involving blood and the magic-dampening
   power of magnetized iron--he defeats Hurwood and destroys his wife's
   soul. In Jamaica, he barely escapes the Navy and fights his way to the
   house of Hurwood's accomplice, who turns out to be Sebastian. He frees
   Beth and makes his way to a harbor, where he is met by Blackbeard, now
   resurrected and assuming a new identity. Combining his male magic with
   Beth's female magic, he vanquishes Blackbeard and marries Beth. The
   book ends as he prepares for the voyage out of Jamaica.
