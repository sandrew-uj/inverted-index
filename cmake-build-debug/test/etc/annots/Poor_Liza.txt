   Liza is a poor serf girl who lives with her elderly sick mother. Her
   father died, leaving Liza the breadwinner of her family at age 15. One
   of Liza's primary ways of making money is to sell flowers she
   picked in Moscow.

   2 years later, while Liza is selling lily-of-the-valley flowers, she
   meets a handsome rich man named Erast. They fall in love, and begin
   spending many nights together, next to the Simonov Monastery lake. Liza
   keeps Erast a secret from her mother by Erast's request. What Liza does
   not know is that Erast, while having a good heart, is a weak, fickle,
   lecherous young man. Erast wants to have a pure love with Liza but
   finds his desire for her growing by the day.

   One summer evening, Liza comes to Erast in tears, as her mother desires
   her to marry a well-off man who she does not love. She declares she can
   only love Erast, and in the heat of the moment, she loses her virginity
   to him. Erast promises he will marry Liza, but in reality, he has
   lost interest in Liza, as she has become unpure to him.

   In the autumn, Erast tells Liza that he is going off to war and leaves
   her. Two months later, when Liza comes to the city, she discovers the
   truth: in the army, he lost all his money in gambling, and he had
   married a rich widow to escape his debt. He gives her a hundred
   rubles, and tells her to forget him. In her grief, Liza drowns
   herself in the lake of the monastery garden where she and Erast
   had spent their time together.
