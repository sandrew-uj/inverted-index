   The game describes the United States in the mid-21st century, after a
   nuclear war started by a cybernetic revolt, which molded the continent
   into a barren wasteland. It seems that the reason for the war to break
   out was a sentient Artificial Intelligence commonly referred to as
   Moloch and made up of interconnected net of military computers:
   automated factories, military facilities, power plants and alike, that
   now cover the whole north of the U.S., from Oregon to the Great Lakes.
   On the south, there is another creation, called the Neojungle, that
   poses a threat to those who survived the war. It is a semi-intelligent
   carnivorous vegetation that grows very quickly, advancing north from
   Latin America. Right in the middle, there are humans. They are
   surrounded by mutant creatures, some bred by Moloch and hostile towards
   humans, and some simply animals and humans misshapen by nuclear
   fallout. On top of that there are Moloch's deadly machines lurking to
   complete the picture. But what is stressed in the book is that the
   worst enemy of humans is within them: hatred, indifference, greed.
