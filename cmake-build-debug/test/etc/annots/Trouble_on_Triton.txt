   As the subtitle implies, the novel offers several conflicting
   perspectives on the concept of utopia. Utopia literally means "good
   place" or "no place". Delany takes the term heterotopia from the
   writings of philosopher Michel Foucault.^[2] Literally, heterotopia
   means "other place" or "a place of differences". Foucault uses the term
   to designate spaces outside everyday fixed institutional and social
   spaces, for example trains, motels and cemeteries. In the novel's
   future solar system, Neptune's moon Triton supports one of several
   human societies independent from Earth, which has developed along
   radically libertarian lines in some ways: though a representative
   government exists, it has virtually no power to regulate private
   behavior, and citizens may choose to live in an area where no laws
   apply at all. Technology provides for a high degree of
   self-modification, so that one can change one's physical appearance,
   gender, sexual orientation, and even specific patterns of likes and
   dislikes.
