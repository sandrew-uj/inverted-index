   Anthropologists Ben Hazard and Ed Stone join a top-secret project which
   uses a time-travel device, affectionately known as "the Bucket", to
   return in time to observe human development throughout history. They
   are shocked to discover that, if they travel far enough into the past
   to research hominids such as Sinanthropus, they find nothing. There is
   no trace of humans or any related species in the deep past.

   Hazard returns from a trip in which he proves that Sinanthropus did not
   exist in the time indicated by the age of the bones. He, Stone and
   their mentor, Franz Gottwald, discuss the problem. Gottwald, a
   by-the-book scientist, insists on facts, not speculation. They
   therefore decide on an exhaustive effort to discover when, and how,
   humans did appear on Earth.

   Travelling back and forth in the past, Hazard and Stone happen upon an
   extraordinary event in France, over 25,000 years ago, near a cave where
   Cro-Magnon remains were found in their time. They see a gigantic
   spaceship land. Humans emerge, along with robots of various shapes and
   sizes. Using fantastic technology they shape the land into a primitive
   home, complete with artifacts such as stone tools. They deposit some
   apparently brainwashed humans wearing animal skins. They also bury
   objects in local caves. Hazard is sure that these are bones left for
   future generations to find.

   Returning to modern times, they join Gottwald to try to solve the
   mystery. Clearly humans did not arise on Earth. The bones planted were
   probably genuine, but must have been brought from the real home of
   humanity. They can understand why humans might be seeded on another
   world, but not why the bones were planted.

   Hazard takes a fishing trip to take his mind off the problem, hoping
   that an idea will occur to him. Remembering one of the chimpanzees used
   by his project trying to solve a simple puzzle, he decides that the
   whole thing is a gigantic experiment, a puzzle to be solved with some
   reward at the end. He also realizes that a necessary part of the
   experiment is an observer, someone who can monitor it. Such a person
   would want to get close to the time-travel project, and the best
   candidate is Gottwald himself, who came from Europe and never talks
   about his past.

   Hazard finds Gottwald's house deserted. Entering, he finds a letter
   addressed to him, from Gottwald. It tells him that he has solved part
   of the puzzle, and for the rest he must press a hidden button and stand
   outside. He does this and is transported to the spaceship, still in
   orbit about Earth after 25,000 years. There he meets Gottwald and his
   wife, who are the last survivors of the people who came in the ship.
   Humans arose on a distant world, discovered faster-than-light space
   travel, carved an empire for themselves, and were then almost
   exterminated by the Enemy, a race of vicious monsters. So horrific are
   these creatures that they are part of human "racial memory", being the
   demons and dragons and other creatures out of nightmare.

   The ship is one of four sent as a last desperate measure. The human
   race had to start again. It needed a "transfusion" of new ideas and
   ways of thinking, in order to survive the inevitable future encounter
   with the Enemy. Gottwald tells Hazard that his people never discovered
   time-travel. It may be the answer they were seeking. They wait for Ed
   Stone, who will surely solve the problem and join them. After that,
   they will begin the process of giving the ship's technology back to
   humanity, so they can be ready for the battles to come.
