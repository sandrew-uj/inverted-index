   The hero discovers he is both cursed with bad luck and blessed with a
   miraculous power - the power to occupy other people's minds - provided
   he dies first. A series of freak accidents bring him closer and closer
   to death, until at last he does die - but miraculously transmigrates
   into the nearest body around. His power to occupy minds is involuntary,
   and when it happens, he overwhelms those he invades, though he is able
   to communicate with them. Unwilling to depart from the bodies he
   occupies, he learns that the only way out of the body he is possessing
   is by dying, presenting him with an unusual ethical conflict.
