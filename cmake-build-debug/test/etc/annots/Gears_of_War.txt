   The Gears of War series takes place on Sera, a fictional Earth-like
   planet. Human civilization develops on Sera and endures a
   millennia-long conflict that leaves humanity on the brink of
   extinction. Sera's leaders broker an era of peace that ushers an era of
   scientific advancements and a cultural renaissance. Humanity's
   population sporadically grows and demands more energy provided by
   fossil and nuclear fuels. Sera's scientists discover Imulsion, a
   naturally occurring substance that can be refined into a potent energy
   source. Imulsion solves Sera's energy crisis but ultimately creates
   great economic disparity. Nations with direct access to Imulsion
   prosper, while other nations fall into financial turmoil.

   Sera's citizens balkanize into two warring factions: the Coalition of
   Ordered Governments (COG) and Union of Independent Republics (UIR). The
   ensuing 79-year strife, known as the Pendulum Wars, consumes millions
   of lives with both sides locked in a virtual stalemate. The UIR
   develops the 'Hammer of Dawn', a system of satellites capable of
   delivering precise and potent orbital-to-surface laser strikes.
   However, a contingent of COG commandos, led by Marcus Fenix, Dominic
   Santiago, and Victor Hoffman launch a daring raid on a UIR stronghold
   and steal the schematics for the Hammer of Dawn. The UIR surrenders
   after witnessing the Hammer of Dawn devastate one of their naval
   vessels after being completed by Marcus Fenix's father, scientist Adam
   Fenix.

   Six weeks after the COG and UIR agreed to an armistice, a race of
   creatures known as the Locust Horde emerge from Sera's depths and begin
   assaulting human cities, wiping out 25% of the world population in the
   first 26 hours. The Locust Horde overwhelms the already battleworn COG
   forces during this surprise attack, referred to as 'Emergence Day'. The
   COG retreats to cities located on the Jacinto Plateau, their last
   bastion where the Locust cannot dig through, and reluctantly bombard
   their own cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust Horde's
   offensive. The ensuing scorched earth tactic destroys much of Sera's
   cities and human population. The COG continues to operate out of the
   capital city of Ephyra and cities on the plateau such as Jacinto, while
   the surviving humans, known as Stranded, are left to wander through
   Sera's charred ruins.

   Five years after Emergence Day, the Locust reemerge and begin a
   campaign of occupying human cities located on the Jacinto Plateau to
   act as stepping stones in order to destroy Ephyra. The Locust are able
   to emerge and overrun the COG capital of Ephyra ten years after
   Emergence Day. During the chaos, Marcus Fenix leads an unauthorized
   mission to save his father, Adam, from the Locust assault. A helicopter
   is shot down by the Locust Horde and crash-lands into the Fenix estate,
   presumably killing Adam Fenix. The COG's leadership court martials
   Marcus and sentences him to life imprisonment. After losing Ephyra, the
   remainder of the COG retreats to Jacinto City, which resides on the
   edge of the plateau against an ocean.

   Gears of War is set fourteen years after the Locust emerged and
   attacked Sera's human population. The COG forces devise a last-ditch
   offensive to destroy the Locust Horde with the Lightmass Bomb,
   weaponized forms of Imulsion. Marcus Fenix, now a disgraced veteran, is
   reinstated into the COG army four years after imprisonment to
   supplement the COG's depleted ranks. Marcus joins his best friend,
   Dominic Santiago, on a mission to map the Locust Horde's tunnel network
   in preparation for the bombing. Their unit is ambushed by Locust Ground
   forces and sustain heavy casualties. Fenix and Santiago regroup with
   two other survivors, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, and continue their
   mission. Marcus prevails in mapping and successfully deploying the
   Lightmass Bomb and crippling the Locust Horde. The Locust Queen Myrrah
   pledges to continue the war effort.

   In the weeks following the Lightmass Bombing, the human population
   suffers from a condition known as Rustlung, a fatal disease caused by
   the inhalation of Imulsion fumes - due to the evaporation of Imulsion
   caused by the Lightmass Bomb. The Locust reemerge and bring with them a
   force allowing them to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau.
   Following the sinking of nearby cities Tollen and Montevado, and the
   desperate raid attacks on Jacinto City, the COG fears that the Locust
   might be trying to sink Jacinto as well.

   In Gears of War 2, the COG forces deploy thousands of soldiers into the
   depths of Sera to battle the Locust Horde and stop their plans to sink
   Jacinto. The COG discovers after the sinking of Ilima City that the
   Locust have been using a gargantuan worm to sink the cities on the
   Jacinto Plateau. After killing the Riftworm, Delta Squad is ordered to
   locate the Locust stronghold by accessing intel from a decommissioned
   COG laboratory called New Hope, which is full of genetically altered
   humans called Sires, which Marcus believes were experiments that led to
   the creation of the Locust Horde. Locating the Locust stronghold Nexus
   under Mount Kadar, the COG discovers during the battle that members of
   the Locust Horde are mutating from exposure from Imulsion into
   "Lambent". These abominations have been forcing the Locust to abandon
   their underground civilization to try to claim the surface world as
   their new home. Marcus devises a plan to intentionally sink Jacinto and
   using the surrounding sea water to flood the Locust and Lambent tunnel
   network. The COG evacuate Jacinto just as the city collapses and drowns
   a majority of the Locust Horde.

   The remaining population of the COG rediscover an island base not
   attacked by the Locust Horde called Vectes, with a town known as
   Pelruan. The Stranded gangs on the island threaten the safety of the
   town, but the COG and Stranded cease when the Lambent begin to overrun
   the island and surrounding ocean. Due to the underground being flooded,
   the Imulsion from the Hollow was raised into the surface of Sera,
   causing a pandemic and turning all life into Lambent organisms. The
   leader of the COG, Chairman Richard Prescott, is believed to be holding
   secrets from the population. Prescott abandons the COG, forcing them to
   disband and live as nomads, surviving against the Lambent and Locust
   stragglers.

   Gears of War 3 is set two years after the COG disbanded. Prescott
   returns to reveal that he kidnapped Marcus Fenix's father during the
   fall of Ephyra and transported him to a secret island facility known as
   Azura, and that Adam has created a device known as the Imulsion
   countermeasure that could neutralize both the Lambent and Locust.
   However, the island was attacked and is occupied by Queen Myrrah and
   the remaining Locust forces. Marcus and his allies reach Azura after
   Dominic sacrifices himself to rescue his friends from imminent demise.
   Adam is rescued and releases his anti-Imulsion weapon but reveals he
   infected himself with the Lambent contagion to develop the weapon. The
   Imulsion countermeasure vaporizes all Lambent, including Adam, and
   crystallizes the Locust. Marcus kills Myrrah and dedicates her demise
   to his fallen friends, family, and comrades.

   Gears of War: Judgment focuses on Baird and Cole during the early
   months after Emergence Day. With military cadet Sofia Hendrick and
   Garron Paduk, a former UIR soldier, they comprise the Kilo Squad. Baird
   disobeys orders to use a Lightmass Missile to destroy Locust forces and
   save survivors at Halvo Bay. Despite also killing the powerful Locust
   leader Karn, the squad is court-martialed because they disobeyed
   orders. But because they saved Col. Ezra Loomis and killed Karn, they
   avoid execution or imprisonment, with Baird demoted from lieutenant to
   private. A separate campaign, "Aftermath", portrays Baird, Cole, and
   Paduk in the hours before the activation of the anti-Imulsion energy
   wave.

   Following the end of the Locust War and Lambent Pandemic, the humans of
   Sera began to rebuild and started with reorganizing the Coalition of
   Ordered Governments. Led by First Minister Anya Stroud, wife of Marcus
   Fenix, the humans begin to rebuild civilization with the assistance of
   robotic engineers created by Damon Baird. The COG was successful in
   creating New Ephyra and other walled cities known as Settlements
   outside of New Ephyra. Following fertility treatment, Anya was able to
   bear Marcus Fenix's son, James Dominic "JD" Fenix. Anya died from
   birthing complications and the COG began a more authoritarian rule -
   prompting many civilians to abandon the COG and live off the land,
   known as Outsiders. JD was sent to boarding school and met his friend
   Delmont "Del" Walker. After joining the military, both JD and Del were
   forced to execute civilians during a protest in Settlement 2, prompting
   them to leave the COG and becoming Outsiders. They joined a village led
   by Reyna Diaz and her brother-in-law, Oscar. Reyna's daughter, Kait,
   became close with JD and Del.

   Gears of War 4 takes place 25 years after the original Gears of War
   trilogy. JD, accompanied by Kait and Del, conduct frequent raids on COG
   fortifications to acquire various supplies. The three successfully fend
   off a COG counterattack only to have their encampment devastated by a
   new foe, called the Swarm. Kait's mother, Reyna, is captured during the
   chaos. JD, Kait, and Del reach out to Marcus, a disgruntled COG
   expatriate, who reluctantly agrees to help them. The COG, led by First
   Minister Mina Jinn, pursue the group after erroneously believing they
   are behind a string of kidnappings. The four reach a Locust burial
   site, where they uncover evidence suggesting that Adam Fenix's
   countermeasure caused the Locust Horde to enter a cocooned
   metamorphosis state. Their fears are confirmed when various Locust
   Horde soldiers attack them in conjunction with the Swarm. The group
   receives assistance from Damon Baird along with Augustus Cole and
   Samantha Byrne. They battle their way to the Swarm's hive and defeat
   multiple Swarm and Locust monstrosities. However, they reach the hive
   to learn that Swarm's hive-mind has forcefully integrated with Reyna.
   Kait frees her mother, knowing she will die but will no longer suffer.
   Reyna gives Kait a parting gift that belonged to her mother - a
   necklace bearing the insignia of the Locust Queen, Myrrah.

   Kait, JD, Del, and Marcus rejoin the COG and offer their intelligence
   to Jinn in order to help fight the Swarm. Kait begins to have
   nightmares and visions related to her mother, the Swarm, and the Locust
   - but refuses to tell the others about it. Marcus and Baird believe
   they will need the Hammer of Dawn back online to help defend against
   the upcoming war with the Swarm. Baird then uncovers additional Hammer
   of Dawn satellites at Azura.

   In Gears 5, JD, Kait, Del, and Marcus travel to Azura to launch the
   Hammer of Dawn satellites. Afterwards, they assist in the evacuation of
   Settlement 2 as the Swarm have begun their attack on COG Settlements.
   Four months later, Kait is captured by the Swarm and connects her to
   the Swarm hivemind, allowing her to control the Swarm to kill the
   humans, including her uncle. She is freed by Marcus and JD, but in her
   grief reveals that she has been having visions and nightmares and
   believes them to be messages by the Swarm, as evidenced by her amulet
   which bears the Locust symbol. Marcus has Kait and Del find answers at
   the New Hope facility. After discovering New Hope and an additional lab
   in Mount Kadar, Kait and Del learn that the Locust were the result of
   genetic experiments done to human children sick with Rustlung and
   splicing them with the DNA of creatures in the Hollow. The mutant
   children, known as Sires, were used to fertilize the stem cells of
   Myrrah, who was born with a genetic immunity to Imulsion. Kait
   discovers that Myrrah was Reyna's mother, making Kait the next in line
   for Queen of the Swarm. She manages to disconnect herself from the
   Swarm hivemind, but in doing so allowed Reyna to be awoken and become
   queen of the Swarm. The Swarm becomes stronger and more intelligent now
   that they have a queen and launch an attack against New Ephyra. Using
   the Hammer of Dawn, the COG is able to repel the Swarm attack, and Kait
   vows to kill Queen Reyna before she can attack again.
