   In a post-apocalyptic world, Malorie Hayes advises two young, unnamed
   children that they will be going down a river in a rowboat. She sternly
   instructs them to not remove their blindfolds or they will die.

   Five years earlier, a pregnant Malorie is visited by her sister,
   Jessica. There is a news report on TV about unexplained mass suicides
   quickly spreading across Europe. While at the hospital for a routine
   checkup, Malorie witnesses a woman hurting herself before others begin
   to panic and chaos erupts. Jessica sees the entity, causing her to
   deliberately crash her car erratically before killing herself by
   walking in front of an oncoming truck.

   As Malorie flees on foot, a woman invites her into a house for safety.
   The woman then sees the entity before going into a trance and then
   sitting inside a burning car, which explodes. A passerby, Tom, picks up
   Malorie from the street, and they are let into the house, where about a
   dozen other people are taking shelter. One is a man employed by a
   grocery store, who theorizes that demonic entities have invaded Earth,
   driving people insane. They in the house cover all the windows and
   blindfold themselves whenever they go out. The house's owner offers to
   monitor the surveillance cameras to watch the entities indirectly, but
   he kills himself while watching.

   A new pregnant survivor, Olympia, arrives, and half of the group go to
   a nearby supermarket due to the diminishing food supply. Malorie gets
   some pet birds along with their supplies, and the presence of the
   entities causes the birds to go into hysterics. The group is attacked
   by a co-worker of Charlie's, but Charlie sacrifices himself to save the
   others, who make it back to the house.

   Sometime after, Felix and Lucy steal the car and drive away. Olympia
   lets Gary, a stranger, into the house, against Douglas' wishes.
   Threatening Gary with a shotgun, Douglas is knocked out and locked in
   the garage. As Olympia and Malorie go into labor simultaneously, Gary
   works on various drawings of the entities and undergoes some form of
   trance before exposing Douglas to the entities and knocking out Tom.
   Gary then proceeds upstairs and uncovers all the windows in the room.
   Olympia fails to look away in time and jumps out the window, killing
   herself. Malorie hides with both of the newborn babies under a cover,
   while Gary then forces Cheryl to look at the entities, causing her to
   stab herself in the neck with a pair of scissors. Douglas blindly
   attempts to kill Gary with a shotgun, but Gary kills him with a pair of
   scissors. As Malorie protects the newborns, Tom recovers consciousness
   in time to overpower and kill Gary.

   Five years later, Tom and Malorie are living together with the
   children, who are called "Boy" and "Girl". They receive a transmission
   from a survivor telling them about a safe community hidden in the
   forest. As they leave their house, they are ambushed by a group of the
   unblindfolded survivors, and Tom runs to distract them so Malorie and
   the children can flee. Tom then uncovers his eyes in order to shoot
   them all, but he is then infected by the entities.

   Malorie and the children make their way blindfolded down the river on a
   boat, carrying the birds to have a warning against the entities. The
   boat flips in the rapids, but they manage to find each other. All three
   are soon separated again when Malorie accidentally slides down a hill,
   and the entities attempt to trick the children into removing their
   blindfolds using Malorie's voice. Malorie regains consciousness,
   telling the children where to find her.

   They eventually reach the community, a former school for the blind.
   Malorie releases the birds and finally gives the children names, Tom
   and Olympia, acknowledging herself to be their mother.
