   An opening narration explains that Earth was being observed by
   extraterrestrials with immense intelligence and no compassion. As man
   dominated the world without doubt, much in the way microorganisms swarm
   in a drop of water, these beings plotted to take it all from us.

   Divorced longshoreman Ray Ferrier works as a crane operator at a dock
   in Brooklyn, New York, and is estranged from his children: 10-year-old
   daughter Rachel, and teenage son Robbie. Ray's pregnant former wife,
   Mary Ann, drops the two off at his house in Bayonne, New Jersey, on her
   way to visit her parents in Boston. Later, a strange storm occurs
   during which lightning strikes multiple times into the middle of a
   local intersection, causing an EMP that instantly fries almost all
   electronic devices. Ray reluctantly joins the crowd at the scene of the
   impacts, where a massive "tripod" war machine emerges from the ground
   and uses powerful energy weapons to destroy the area, disintegrating
   most of the witnesses into a grey dust.

   Ray then collects his children, steals a van from the local mechanic
   after he advised him on how to fix it before heading into town, and
   drives to Mary Ann's empty home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge.
   That night, they take shelter in the basement, but they soon hear a
   strange roaring noise followed by an explosion, which destroys the
   house. The next morning, Ray and Robbie discover that a Boeing 747 had
   crashed into the neighborhood. Ray then meets a wandering news team
   scavenging the wreckage for food, who explain to him that there are
   multiple tripods that have attacked major cities around the world,
   adding that the tripods have force shields to protect them from most of
   humanity's defenses, and the tripods' pilots traveled to Earth within
   the lightning storms as a way to enter their machines, which are
   assumed to have been buried underground for thousands of years.

   Ray then decides to drive the kids to Boston to be with their mother,
   but a desperate mob swarms their vehicle, forcing them to abandon it.
   They eventually get to a Hudson River ferry only to be surrounded by
   tripods, which either massacre or abduct many of the refugees, but
   Ray's family manages to escape. They then witness U.S. Marines engaging
   in a battle with some tripods. Much to Ray's dismay, Robbie eventually
   joins the futile fight against the aliens, while Ray and Rachel quickly
   flee the scene. The US Marines are obliterated with Robbie presumed to
   have been killed with them. Shortly after, the pair are offered shelter
   in a nearby basement by a deranged man named Harlan Ogilvy.

   The three remain undetected for several days, even as a probe and a
   group of aliens explore the basement. They soon discover that the
   aliens have started cultivating a red-colored vegetation across the
   landscape that is quickly spreading, and the group deduces that the
   aliens are terraforming Earth, and potentially using the red vegetation
   as a food source. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown
   upon witnessing the tripods harvesting human blood and tissue to
   fertilize the alien vegetation. Fearing Ogilvy's mad shouting will
   alert the aliens, Ray reluctantly kills him. A second tripod probe then
   catches the Ferriers sleeping, causing Rachel to flee and get abducted
   by the tripod. Ray is then purposely abducted by alerting the aliens
   with grenades. With help from other abductees, Ray eventually uses the
   grenades to destroy the tripod from within, freeing them all.

   A few days later, Ray and Rachel arrive in Boston, where they find the
   alien vegetation withering and the tripods inexplicably collapsing.
   When an active tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it,
   indicating that its force shields have been disabled. Ray alerts the
   soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd, who shoot it down using anti-tank
   missiles. As the soldiers advance on the downed tripod, a hatch opens
   and a pale, sickly alien struggles halfway out before collapsing and
   dying. Ray and Rachel finally reach Mary Ann's parents' house, where
   they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie (who had somehow survived).

   A closing narration then explains that the aliens' deaths was due to
   their immune systems being unable to handle the countless billions of
   microbes that inhabit the Earth, and that humanity has "earned" the
   right to the planet by virtue of naturally coexisting with the rest of
   its biosphere.
