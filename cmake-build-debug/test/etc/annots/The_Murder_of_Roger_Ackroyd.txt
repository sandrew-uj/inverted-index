   In King's Abbot, wealthy widow Mrs Ferrars unexpectedly commits
   suicide, which distresses her fiance widower Roger Ackroyd. At dinner
   that evening in Ackroyd's home of Fernly Park, his guests include his
   sister-in-law Mrs Cecil Ackroyd and her daughter Flora, big-game hunter
   Major Blunt, Ackroyd's personal secretary Geoffrey Raymond, and Dr
   James Sheppard, whom Ackroyd invited earlier that day. During dinner,
   Flora announces her engagement to Ackroyd's stepson, Ralph Paton. After
   dinner, Ackroyd reveals to Sheppard in his study that Mrs Ferrars had
   confided in him that she was being blackmailed over the murder of her
   husband. He then asks Sheppard to leave, wishing to read a letter from
   Mrs Ferrars that arrives in the post, containing her suicide note. Once
   home, Sheppard receives a call and leaves for Fernly Park again, after
   informing his sister that Parker, Ackroyd's butler, has found Ackroyd
   murdered. But when Sheppard arrives at Fernly Park, Parker denies
   making such a call; yet he, Sheppard, Raymond and Blunt find Ackroyd
   dead in his study, stabbed to death with a weapon from his collection.

   Hercule Poirot, living in the village, comes out of retirement at
   Flora's request. She does not believe Paton killed Ackroyd, despite him
   disappearing and police finding his footprints on the study's window.
   Poirot learns a few important facts on the case: all in the household,
   except parlourmaid Ursula Bourne, have alibis for the murder; while
   Raymond and Blunt heard Ackroyd talking to someone after Sheppard left,
   Flora was the last to see him that evening; Sheppard met a stranger on
   his way home, at Fernly Park's gates; Ackroyd met a representative of a
   dictaphone company a few days earlier; Parker recalls seeing a chair
   that had been in an odd position in the study when the body was found,
   that has since returned to its original position; the letter from Mrs
   Ferrars has disappeared since the murder. Poirot asks Sheppard for the
   exact time he met his stranger. He later finds a goose quill and a
   scrap of starched cambric in the summer house, and a ring with the
   inscription "From R" in the backyard.

   Raymond and Mrs Ackroyd later reveal they are in debt, but Ackroyd's
   death will resolve this as they stood to gain from his will. Flora
   admits she never saw her uncle after dinner; she was taking money from
   his bedroom. Her revelation throws doubts on everyone's alibis, and
   leaves Raymond and Blunt as the last people to hear Ackroyd alive.
   Blunt reveals he is secretly in love with Flora. Poirot calls a second
   meeting, adding Parker, the butler; Miss Russell, the housekeeper; and
   Ralph Paton, whom he had found. He reveals that the goose quill is a
   heroin holder belonging to Miss Russell's illegitimate son, the
   stranger whom Sheppard met on the night of the murder. He also informs
   everyone that Ursula secretly married Paton, as the ring he found was
   hers; it was discarded after Paton chastised her for informing his
   uncle of this fact, which had led to the termination of her employment.
   Poirot then proceeds to inform all that he knows the killer's identity,
   confirmed by a telegram received during the meeting. He does not reveal
   the name; instead he issues a warning to the killer. When Poirot is
   alone with Sheppard, he reveals that he knows him to be Ackroyd's
   killer.

   Sheppard was Mrs Ferrars' blackmailer and murdered Ackroyd to stop him
   knowing this; he suspected her suicide note would mention this fact,
   and so he took it after the murder. He then used a dictaphone Ackroyd
   had, to make it appear he was still alive when he departed, before
   looping back to the study's window to plant Paton's footprints; Poirot
   had noted an inconsistency in the time he mentioned for the meeting at
   the gates. As he wanted to be on the scene when Ackroyd's body was
   found, he asked a patient earlier in the day to call him some time
   after the murder, so as to have an excuse for returning to Fernly Park;
   Poirot's telegram confirmed this. When no-one was around in the study,
   Sheppard removed the dictaphone, and returned the chair that concealed
   it from view to its original place. Poirot tells Sheppard that all this
   information will be reported to the police in the morning. Dr Sheppard
   continues writing his report on Poirot's investigation (the novel
   itself), admitting his guilt and wishing his account was that of
   Poirot's failure to solve Ackroyd's murder. The novel's epilogue serves
   as his suicide note.
