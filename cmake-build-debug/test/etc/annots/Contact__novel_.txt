   Contact is a 1985 hard science fiction novel by American scientist Carl
   Sagan. It deals with the theme of contact between humanity and a more
   technologically advanced, extraterrestrial life form. It ranked No. 7
   on the 1985 U.S. bestseller list. The novel originated as a screenplay
   by Sagan and Ann Druyan (whom he later married) in 1979; when
   development of the film stalled, Sagan decided to convert the stalled
   film into a novel. The film concept was subsequently revived and
   eventually released in 1997 as the film Contact starring Jodie Foster.
