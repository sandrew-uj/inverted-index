   The Eyes of the Dragon takes place entirely within the realm of Delain
   (which itself is located within In-World from The Dark Tower series, as
   established in "The Little Sisters of Eluria"). It is told from the
   perspective of an unnamed storyteller/narrator, who speaks casually and
   frankly to the reader, frequently adding his own commentary on
   characters' motivations and the like.

   King Roland's magician, Flagg, seeking to destroy the Kingdom of
   Delain, sees his plans being ruined by the good heart of Queen Sasha.
   After Sasha gives birth to Peter, a noble and worthy future king, Flagg
   realizes that his position, his plans, and his life may be in danger
   because of Peter. When Sasha is pregnant with a second son, Flagg
   seizes the opportunity. He forces the Queen's midwife to cut Sasha as
   the second son, Thomas, is born. Sasha bleeds to death and Flagg begins
   plotting to remove Peter. As Peter becomes a teenager, he begins the
   custom of bringing a glass of wine to his father before bed each night.
   Flagg decides to use this as a means of framing Peter. He dissolves a
   poison called "Dragon Sand" in a glass of wine and delivers it to the
   king after Peter leaves. Previously, in an attempt to win Thomas'
   friendship, Flagg had shown him a secret passage where Thomas could spy
   on his father. Unbeknownst to Flagg, when he delivers the poison,
   Thomas is watching through the glass eyes of the mounted head of
   Roland's greatest trophy, Niner the dragon. Flagg plants evidence
   incriminating Peter.

   After a brief trial, during which the judge decides Peter is guilty, he
   is locked up in the enormous tower called the Needle in the center of
   the city. Thomas is then crowned King, although he is only twelve years
   old; due to his youth and his fearful inexperience, he allows Flagg
   enormous amounts of power. At the start of his long stay in the Needle,
   Peter manages to send a note to the judge who convicted him, Anders
   Peyna, with the seemingly innocuous requests to have his mother's old
   dollhouse and napkins with his meals. Peyna is puzzled by the requests,
   but, seeing no harm in them, grants them. Five years later, Peter
   escapes from the Needle, having used the toy loom in the dollhouse and
   threads from the napkins to make a rope. After the escape he and his
   allies rush to get Roland's bow and arrow. However, it is not to be
   found because Thomas had it once they got into the king's "sitting
   room". Flagg, now revealed as a demonic being, is about to kill them
   when Thomas reveals himself and tells Flagg that he (Thomas) watched
   Flagg poison Roland. Thomas shoots Flagg in the eye, but Flagg uses
   magic to disappear and escape. At the end of the novel, Peter is
   declared to be the rightful king. Thomas, who has become deeply hated
   in Delain, sets off alongside his butler, Dennis, to find Flagg. They
   find him and confront him, but the narrator does not reveal the
   outcome.
