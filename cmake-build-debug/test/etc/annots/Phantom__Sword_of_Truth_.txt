   A continuation of the story in Chainfire, Phantom begins with Richard
   Rahl searching for his wife, Kahlan Amnell, whom only he remembers. As
   the reader discovered in Chainfire, the spell used to make everyone
   forget Kahlan, Chainfire, was initiated by the Sisters of the Dark,
   working for the Keeper of the Underworld. Richard reveals that not only
   the spell but also all magic has been corrupted due to the effects of
   the chimes being in the world. Due to this corruption Kahlan is not
   invisible to everyone and Jagang uses this fact to continue to control
   her.
