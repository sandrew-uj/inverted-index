   Set at a bucolic mid-western college known only as
   The-College-on-the-Hill, White Noise follows a year in the life of Jack
   Gladney, a professor who has made his name by pioneering the field of
   Hitler studies (though he has not taken German lessons until this
   year). He has been married five times to four women and rears a brood
   of children and stepchildren (Heinrich, Denise, Steffie, Wilder) with
   his current wife, Babette. Jack and Babette are both extremely afraid
   of death; they frequently wonder which of them will be the first to
   die. The first part of White Noise, called "Waves and Radiation", is a
   chronicle of contemporary family life combined with academic satire.

   There is little plot development in this first section, which mainly
   serves as an introduction to the characters and themes which dominate
   the rest of the book. For instance, the mysterious deaths of men in
   "Mylex" (intended to suggest Mylar) suits and the ashen, shaken
   survivors of a plane that went into free fall anticipate the
   catastrophe of the book's second part. "Waves and Radiation" also
   introduces Murray Jay Siskind, Jack's friend and fellow college
   professor, who discusses theories about death, supermarkets, media,
   "psychic data," and other facets of contemporary American culture.

   In the second part, "The Airborne Toxic Event," a chemical spill from a
   rail car releases a black noxious cloud over Jack's home region,
   prompting an evacuation. Frightened by his exposure to the toxin
   (called Nyodene Derivative,) Jack is forced to confront his mortality.
   An organization called SIMUVAC (short for "simulated evacuation") is
   also introduced in Part Two, an indication of simulations replacing
   reality.

   In part three of the book, "Dylarama", Jack discovers that Babette has
   been cheating on him with a man she calls "Mr. Gray" in order to gain
   access to a fictional drug called Dylar, an experimental treatment for
   the terror of death. The novel becomes a meditation on modern society's
   fear of death and its obsession with chemical cures as Jack seeks to
   obtain his own black-market supply of Dylar. However, Dylar does not
   work for Babette, and it has many possible side effects, including
   losing the ability to "distinguish words from things, so that if
   someone said 'speeding bullet', I would fall to the floor and take
   cover".

   Jack continues to obsess over death. During a discussion about
   mortality, Murray suggests that killing someone could alleviate the
   fear. Jack decides to track down and kill Mr. Gray, whose real name, he
   has learned, is Willie Mink. After a black comedy scene of Jack driving
   and rehearsing, in his head, several ways in which their encounter
   might proceed, he successfully locates and shoots Willie, who at the
   time is in a delirious state caused by his own Dylar addiction.

   Jack puts the gun in Willie's hand to make the murder look like a
   suicide, but Willie then shoots Jack in the arm. Suddenly realizing the
   needless loss of life, Jack carries Willie to a hospital run by German
   nuns who do not believe in God or an afterlife. Having saved Willie,
   Jack returns home to watch his children sleep.

   The final chapter describes Wilder, Jack's youngest child, riding a
   tricycle across the highway and miraculously surviving.
