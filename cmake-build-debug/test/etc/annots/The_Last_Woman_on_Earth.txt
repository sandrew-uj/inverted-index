   The full film

   Harold Gern (Antony Carbone), a successful businessman from New York
   who is constantly in legal trouble, is spending a holiday in Puerto
   Rico with his attractive wife, Evelyn (Betsy Jones-Moreland), whom he
   married "between trials." They are joined by Martin Joyce (Robert
   Towne, billed as Edward Wain), Harold's lawyer, who has come to discuss
   the latest indictment.

   Harold invites him along on a boat trip during which all three try out
   some newly bought scuba diving equipment. When they resurface, they are
   unable to breathe without using their scuba tanks. They climb back into
   their boat and find Manuel, the crewman, dead, apparently of
   asphyxiation. Upon rowing ashore, they enter the jungle. With their air
   running out, they discover that the foliage gives off oxygen that they
   can breathe.

   When they go into town, they find nobody left alive and cannot contact
   anyone by radio. It dawns upon the three that they might be the only
   survivors in the area, maybe in the world. The domineering Harold takes
   charge. They concentrate on becoming self-sufficient, and the two men
   fish, as marine creatures have survived. Later, they also find living
   insects and baby chicks, presumably newly hatched. Harold feels that in
   the long run, they will have to move north to a colder climate to avoid
   problems with insects and food preservation and to increase their
   chances of meeting other survivors.

   Harold asserts ownership of Eve as the husband. Martin reminds him the
   rules have changed. Eve has never felt love from Harold and was only a
   possession. She finds freedom. Harold and Martin have a physical fight
   after Martin has slept with Eve. She tells her husband she was not
   raped. Harold gives Martin two hours to leave. Eve wants Martin to ask
   her to come with him and he does. The two leave together and Harold
   follows in a chase to the boat. Harold beats up and kills Martin. He
   holds out his hand to Eve and the two go together.
