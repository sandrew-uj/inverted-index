   In 2050, sometime after a nuclear war, much of the ruling elite has
   succumbed to a disease that requires a transfusion of blood. Bands of
   militaristic, government-sanctioned band of nomads called the Warriors,
   led by the Baalca, forcibly use needles to extract healthy blood from
   unwilling females and deliver it to the rulers. Zak (Andrew MacGregor)
   and Iodine (Joe Maffei) are regarded as a subversive threat to the
   blood bank troops. Lucas (William Smith) and Danielle (Melanie Kilgour)
   try to stop the blood harvesting.
