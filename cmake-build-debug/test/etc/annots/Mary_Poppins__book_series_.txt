   Mary Poppins is a series of eight children's books written by
   Australian-British writer P. L. Travers and published over the period
   1934 to 1988. Mary Shepard was the illustrator throughout the
   series.^[1]

   The books centre on the magical English nanny Mary Poppins, who is
   blown by the East wind to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, London, and into
   the Banks' household to care for their children. Encounters with
   pavement-painters and shopkeepers, and various adventures ensue, until
   Mary Poppins abruptly leaves, i.e., "pops out". Only the first three of
   the eight books feature Mary Poppins arriving and leaving. The later
   five books recount previously unrecorded adventures from her original
   three visits. As Travers explains in her introduction to Mary Poppins
   in the Park, "She cannot forever arrive and depart."^[2]

   The books were adapted by Walt Disney into a musical film titled Mary
   Poppins (1964), starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. The film
   Saving Mr. Banks (2013) depicted the making of the 1964 film. Disney's
   sequel to the 1964 film, Mary Poppins Returns, was released in 2018,
   and stars Emily Blunt as Poppins.

   In 2004, Disney Theatrical in collaboration with Sir Cameron Mackintosh
   (who had previously acquired the stage rights from Travers) produced a
   stage musical also called Mary Poppins in London's West End theatre.
   The stage musical was transferred to Broadway, in New York, in 2006,
   where it ran until its closing on 3 March 2013.^[3]
