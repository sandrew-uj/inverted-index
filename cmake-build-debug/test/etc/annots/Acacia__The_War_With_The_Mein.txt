   Leodan Akaran, ruler of the Known World, has inherited generations of
   apparent peace and prosperity, won ages ago by his ancestors. A widower
   of high intelligence, he presides over an empire called Acacia, after
   the idyllic island from which he rules. He dotes on his four children
   and hides from them the dark realities of traffic in drugs and human
   lives on which their prosperity depends. He hopes that he might change
   this, but powerful forces stand in his way. A deadly assassin sent from
   a race called the Mein, exiled long ago to an ice-locked stronghold in
   the frozen north, strikes at Leodan in the heart of Acacia while other
   enemies unleash surprise attacks across the empire. On his deathbed,
   Leodan puts into play a plan to allow his children to escape, each to
   their separate destiny. His children begin a quest to avenge their
   father's death and restore the Acacian empire-this time on the basis of
   universal freedom.

   The novel is notable for the complexity of Durham's imagined world, one
   in which political, economic, mythological and morally ambiguous forces
   all influence the fates of the ethnically and culturally diverse
   population. In some ways the novel uses familiar fantasy frameworks,
   but over the course of the novel many fantasy tropes are overturned or
   skewed in surprising ways. It is a fairly self-contained tale, but the
   author is at work on more volumes set in this world.
