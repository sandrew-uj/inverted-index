   Enoch Wallace, an American Civil War veteran, is chosen by an alien to
   administer a way station for interplanetary travel. His job is to
   monitor the machinery of the way station and make sure arrival
   conditions meet the biological needs of the wide variety of aliens. He
   is the only human being who knows of the existence of these aliens
   until almost a hundred years later, when the US government becomes
   aware of and suspicious about his failure to age or die.
