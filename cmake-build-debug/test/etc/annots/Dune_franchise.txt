   The Dune saga is set tens of thousands of years in humanity's future,
   26,392 A.D. (10,191 A.G.). Faster-than-light travel has been
   developed, and humans have colonized a vast number of worlds, but a
   great reaction against technology has resulted in a ban on any kind of
   "thinking machine", with the creation or possession of such punishable
   by immediate death. Despite this prohibition, humanity continues to
   develop and advance other branches of technology, including ESP and
   instruments of war. At the time of the first book's setting, humanity
   has formed a feudal interstellar empire known as the Imperium, run by
   several Great Houses that oversee various planets. Of key interest is
   the planet Arrakis, known as "Dune". Entirely a desert planet with
   nearly no precipitation, it is the only planet where a special
   life-extending drug, melange or "the spice", can be found. In addition
   to life-extension, melange enhances the mental capacity of humans: it
   enables humans known as Mentats to perform complex calculations without
   the aid of computers, allows for the mutated Spacing Guild pilots to
   navigate folded space and travel the distances between planets, and
   creates the visions and powers of the Bene Gesserit, a religious group
   that secretly seeks to control the direction humanity takes. Melange is
   difficult to acquire not only due to the harsh environment of Arrakis,
   but also the presence of giant sandworms that are drawn towards any
   movement on the sands of the planet. Control of Arrakis, its spice
   production, and the impact on humanity's development become the
   centerpoints of a thousand-years long conflict that develops through
   the series.
