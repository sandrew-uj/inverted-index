   Lily's Crossing is set in the United States in the 1940s. The story is
   about Lily and Albert, two children who face grief at a young age and
   must help and learn from each other through the summer.

   Lily lives in St. Albans, Queens with her father and grandmother. Her
   mother died when Lily was a small girl. Each summer Lily and her father
   (Poppy) stay in Far Rockaway near the Atlantic Ocean at her
   grandmother's (Gram) house. She loves going there because it is far
   from her house and she is able to relax and explore the neighborhood.
   Lily has a friend, Margaret, and they spend most of their summer days
   together gossiping and watching movies. Lily feels she needs to fix
   some problems in her life, one of which is lying because it has become
   a habit for her and she finds it fun.

   This summer is different because the story starts in 1944, which was
   when World War II was occurring in Europe. Her whole world begins to
   change because her father must go overseas and her friend Margaret is
   moving to Detroit with her family for her father to work on planes.
   Lily must find a new friend to replace Margaret. She meets a new friend
   called Albert Orban. Lily begins to follow Albert, which makes him
   uncomfortable and distanced from her, until a series of events leads
   them to cross paths and become friends. Albert is a refugee from
   Hungary who has escaped from the Nazis and dreams of reuniting with his
   family one day. He is not interested in making friends. While Poppy is
   away, Gram becomes very worried for him because she does not have a way
   to contact him and Lily and new view of the war. Lily becomes a support
   system for Albert because he is alone and his family is far away. Lily
   wants to help him pass his hard time by taking him on new adventures.
   Albert learns to swim giving him some trust in Lily. Albert begins to
   open up to Lily about his life in Hungary which Lily describes each
   conversation his voice being restless. Albert has a sister Ruth that he
   is desperately trying to find. She was left behind because she had
   measles and they could not escape together. Albert is willing to put
   his life in danger to find her
