   Annie is 18 and Carl 20. Although both of their families are against
   their marriage, the couple weds anyway. They move to Carl's college
   campus where he is studying to become a lawyer. He quickly discovers
   that it is hard to keep up with school while trying to entertain a
   spouse.

   With the help of the college dean, Carl and Annie are able to stay
   afloat in their new life together. Life seems to be going perfectly
   until Annie learns that she is pregnant. Because she is concerned about
   how Carl, her mother, and her mother-in-law will react, she keeps her
   pregnancy secret. After Carl discovers that Annie is pregnant, he takes
   on two jobs to support them and the baby.

   After Carl's graduation, Annie and their child move to a different part
   of the state where Carl starts a law practice.
