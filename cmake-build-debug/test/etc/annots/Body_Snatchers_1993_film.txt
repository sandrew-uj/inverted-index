   Steve Malone, an agent from the Environmental Protection Agency, is
   sent to a military base in Alabama to test possible effects on the
   surrounding ecological system caused by military actions. With him is
   his teenage daughter from his first marriage, Marti, his second wife
   Carol, and Marti's half brother Andy. On their way to the base, they
   stop at a gas station. In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an MP
   member with a knife. When he notices her fear, he lets go of her,
   satisfied that she shows an emotional response. Before she leaves the
   room, he warns her, "they get you when you sleep".

   Steve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti
   makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day
   in day care, Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider
   among the other somehow conformist children. He is picked up and
   brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim quickly feel
   attracted to each other. Meanwhile, while examining soil samples, Steve
   is approached by medical officer Major Collins, who asks him about
   psychological effects, particularly narcophobia (the fear of sleep),
   and their possible relation to toxication of the environment. Steve
   believes that a physiological reaction would be more likely.

   In the evening, Marti and Jenn go to the bar attended by the station's
   military personnel, where they meet not only Tim but also the MP who
   threatened Marti at the gas station. He denies that they ever met
   before. That night, a group of soldiers can be seen picking giant pods
   from the river running by the base. When Andy wakes up and enters his
   mother's room, Carol's body crumbles to dust, while a naked soulless
   double emerges from the closet. Nobody believes Andy's story that his
   real mother is dead and the person pretending to be Carol is only an
   impostor.

   The following night, Marti and her father are nearly "taken over" too
   by duplicates emerging from the giant pods. Carol attempts to convince
   Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends
   confusion and anger. She also claims that there's no place to go, as
   the events at the base are not an isolated incident. Steve is almost
   shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and Andy drag him out
   the door. Carol emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts other
   "pod people" to the presence of a human being. Now the majority in
   numbers, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans.

   After hiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse, Steve enters Major Collins'
   office. The hysterical Major tries to call for help, but the line is
   blocked. While swallowing sleep-prevention pills Collins announces that
   it is too late to run; all they can do is fight. Their conversation is
   interrupted by the arrival of a group of pod people, led by base
   commander General Platt. While Steve hides, the pod people try to
   convince the Major that the individual is not important, and that only
   conformity can solve the world's problems. The Major shoots himself
   rather than live in such a world.

   Steve returns to his children and tells them to follow him, claiming to
   have found a way out. They drive aimlessly through the military base,
   as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by
   carrying out pods in trucks. Realizing that her father was replicated
   while he was away, Marti swerves the car to the side and tries to
   escape with her brother. Tim, who escaped his former comrades who tried
   to turn him into one of them, suddenly appears and Marti takes his gun
   and shoots the Steve duplicate. Pod Steve's body shrinks into a mass of
   seething, bloody goo.

   Tim manages to get hold of a helicopter gunship, but Marti and Andy are
   taken away by the pod people. They sedate both of them and take them to
   the base infirmary where the remaining human beings are being
   systematically duplicated by pods. Tim is able to rescue Marti, despite
   her naked pod duplicate trying to seduce him. Incomplete, it dies when
   he pulls its connecting tendrils off Marti.

   Marti and Tim leave the building, pretending to be pod people so they
   can get to Tim's helicopter to escape. However, they are spotted by
   Jenn, now a pod duplicate, who gets suspicious and tells Marti she saw
   Andy looking for her. When Marti reacts by displaying emotion, Jenn
   responds by giving out a pod scream to alert the other pod people. Tim
   and Marti manage to get in the helicopter and are joined at the last
   minute by Andy who runs up to them. But right after taking off, Andy,
   who is actually a pod duplicate, attacks both and tries to bring down
   the helicopter. After a short scuffle, a heartbroken Marti is forced to
   throw Pod-Andy out of the helicopter and he gives out a pod scream
   while falling to his death.

   The ending of the film is an ambiguous one. Tim destroys the trucks
   filled with pods with the helicopter's rockets, while Marti confesses
   her profound hatred in a voice-over narration, thereby hinting at a
   loss of humanitarian quality. While they land on another base, the
   words of Marti's replaced stepmother earlier in the film can be heard,
   suggesting that the phenomenon may have already spread beyond the army
   base: "Where you gonna go, where you gonna run, where you gonna hide?
   Nowhere... 'cause there's no one like you left."
