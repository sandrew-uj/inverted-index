   By the 21st century, the Moon has been colonized, and although still
   very much a research establishment, it is visited by tourists who can
   afford the trip. One of its attractions is a cruise across one of the
   lunar seas, named the Sea of Thirst, (located within the Sinus Roris)
   filled with an extremely fine dust, a fine powder far drier than the
   contents of a terrestrial desert and which almost flows like water,
   instead of the common regolith which covers most of the lunar surface.
   A specially designed "boat" named the Selene skims over the surface of
   the dust in the same manner as a jetski.

   But on one cruise, a moonquake causes a cavern to collapse, upsetting
   the equilibrium. As the dust-cruiser Selene passes over, it sinks about
   15 metres below the surface of the dust, hiding the vessel from view,
   and trapping it beneath the dust. Immediately there are potentially
   fatal problems for the crew and passengers inside. The sunken Selene
   has a limited air supply, there is no way for heat generated to escape,
   communications are impossible, and no one else is sure where Selene has
   been lost. As the Selene heats up and the air becomes unbreathable,
   young Captain Pat Harris and his chief stewardess Sue Wilkins try to
   keep the passengers occupied and psychologically stable while waiting
   to be rescued. They are helped by a retired space ship captain and
   explorer, Commodore Hansteen, who is initially traveling incognito.

   Chief Engineer (Earthside) Robert Lawrence is sceptical that a rescue
   can be mounted, even if the Selene can be located. He is ready to
   abandon an initially unsuccessful search, when he is contacted by
   Thomas Lawson, a brilliant but eccentric astronomer who, from his
   vantage point on a satellite high above the Moon, Lagrange II, believes
   he has detected the remains of a heat trail on the surface. An
   expedition is organised and Lawrence indeed makes contact with the
   Selene. However the completely alien environment results in numerous
   unforeseen complications. The rescue mission decides to sink a tube
   supplying oxygen to the Selene first, in an effort to buy time to think
   of a way to get the passengers out. However, this becomes a race
   against the clock, as the heat in the Selene knocks out the chemical
   air purification system and the passengers are suffering from CO[2]
   poisoning. To preserve air, most passengers enter a chemically induced
   sleep, with only Pat Harris and physicist Duncan McKenzie staying
   awake. Just in time, the rescuers manage to drill a hole in the roof
   and deliver an air supply.

   A plan is hatched to save the passengers of the Selene by sinking
   several concrete caissons to the roof of the ship and cutting a hole.
   When the first caisson is sunk, disaster strikes again: the liquid
   waste of the passengers had been expelled out of the ship, turning the
   dust around it into mud, which causes another, smaller, cave-in. The
   Selene sinks once more, this time only a small distance, but crucially,
   at a slope. The caissons cannot be connected to the roof which is now
   sloping at 30 degrees. The air supply and communications have also been
   damaged. After restoring these latter two, a new plan is made to sink
   the caissons, but now the bottom one has a flexible fitting attached to
   it which can be mounted to the sloping roof of the Selene. The rescue
   mission works according to plan: the caissons are sunk, the dust is
   scooped out and the connection is made, but now time is running out
   again. When the air supply holes were drilled, Selene's double hull was
   breached and the space in between slowly filled with dust. The
   metal-rich dust reached the battery packs and short-circuited them.
   This causes the battery compartment in the stern to burn slowly. The
   resulting breach is barricaded by the passengers, but dust is still
   pouring in and there is a fear that the burning material will cause the
   liquid oxygen supply to explode. Meanwhile, Robert Lawrence is working
   in the rescue shaft: he sets a small ring charge to make a hole in the
   roof. Just in time, the hole is made and the passengers escape through
   the shaft. Captain Harris is the last to leave, up to his waist in
   dust. Just when he is clear of the shaft, the liquid oxygen explodes,
   destroying the Selene.

   A short epilogue sees Lawrence writing his memoirs, Pat Harris and Sue
   Wilkins are married. Pat Harris is the captain of the Selene II on its
   maiden cruise which will also be the last cruise for Harris as he is
   hoping to transfer to the space service.

   Duncan McKenzie, one of the Dust-cruiser passengers, is described as of
   Australian Aboriginal descent. A different character, Duncan Makenzie,
   with "dark brown" skin, appears in Arthur C. Clarke's later novel
   Imperial Earth.
