   In 1994, the US Navy is testing a new missile, but after the launch it
   mysteriously disappears and it is clear that if the rocket reaches
   civilian areas they will be in big trouble. Carol Dawson, a journalist,
   is alerted by an unusual sight of whales in the Miami area, and decides
   to go and write about it.

   Armed with special equipment provided by her friend, Dr. Dale Michaels
   from MOI (Miami Oceanographic Institute), goes to investigate the
   rumors of a missing missile belonging to the Marines and that could be
   behind the mysterious whale behavior lately. She hires the services of
   Nick Williams and Jefferson Troy, owners of a little boat so she can
   get to the Gulf of Mexico and investigate closer if a missile has
   something to do with all of the above.

   They end up finding an unknown artifact, bringing a lot of doubts about
   its nature, and even if it is part of a lost treasure that could be
   worth millions. Old friends of Williams and Troy noticed the finding
   and just like the old times, they want to steal it from them.

   In the background of the story, the author talks about a submarine
   snake civilization on a planet called Canthor, and how they were
   struggling to stay alive due to new threats into their ecosystem. It is
   revealed later in the story that the artifact found in the sea is
   actually a cradle that contains seeds with altered superhumans, which
   were extracted from earth millions of years ago and were altered so
   they could live with other species (including the submarine snakes) on
   earth. The spaceship that carries the cradle is manned by
   robots/cyborgs and has hidden itself on Earth's ocean floor to make
   repairs.

   Dawson, Williams and Troy found the damaged ship in the bottom of the
   sea while looking for the missile, and were asked to gather materials
   so the ship can be repaired and it could go back to its mission. Before
   leaving earth, the ship asked the humans to keep the cradle because it
   would enormously help the human race to have such superhuman seeds to
   develop faster and better through time, but in the end the humans
   refuse in order to avoid future wars between the human and superhumans.
