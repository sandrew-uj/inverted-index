   The novel tells the story of the Angeluzzi-Corbos family, a family of
   immigrants living an adopted life in New York City. The head of the
   family is Lucia Santa, a wife, widow and mother of two families. It is
   her formidable will that steers them through the Great Depression and
   the early years of World War II. But she cannot prevent the conflict
   between Italian and American values.
