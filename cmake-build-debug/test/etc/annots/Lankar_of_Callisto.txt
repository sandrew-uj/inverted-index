   Throughout the series, author Lin Carter has portrayed himself as the
   recipient and editor of the manuscripts of protagonist Jonathan Dark
   (Jandar), teleported from the Jovian moon Callisto (moon) (or Thanator,
   as its inhabitants call it) to the ruined Cambodian city of Arangkhor.
   In this volume he finally travels to Cambodia, hoping to learn what
   became of Jandar after the conclusion of the last volume of his
   memoirs, Mind Wizards of Callisto.

   Once in Arangkhor Carter accidentally falls into the well-like
   teleportation device himself, and is duly transported to the jungle
   moon as Jandar had been. A literal babe in the woods, he is hardly cut
   out to become an interplanetary hero; indeed, he spends much of his
   sojourn on Thanator mooning like a tourist over its extraordinary
   sights, likening them to wonders of which he has read or seen portrayed
   in various works of fantastic literature and art.

   Carter is soon taken in hand by an othode, a forest creature with the
   personality of a faithful dog, which becomes his companion and
   protector against the local perils. It defends him against a Vastodon
   and later saves him from an immense spiderweb. Carter acquires another
   companion in the native boy Tarin, who had also been trapped in the
   web, and an abbreviated native-style name, "Lankar," which Tarin finds
   easier to pronounce.

   They subsequently encounter warriors from Shondakar, the kingdom of
   Jandar's love interest Princess Darloona, and join the expedition
   against the hidden city of Kuur, lair of the evil Mind Wizards who hold
   the hero captive. Carter's othode even manages to uncover the secret
   entry to the city, but Carter himself is caught and imprisoned with
   Jandar.

   All comes out well, as they are rescued by Tarin and in a climatic
   battle the Mind Wizards are almost all killed. (One is later revealed
   to have escaped, to permit sequel possibilities.) At the end of the
   story Carter manages to catch the return beam to Earth, content to
   resume his role as redactor, rather than participant, in Jandar's
   adventures.
