   The two main characters of the book are the narrator, Sal Paradise, and
   his friend Dean Moriarty, much admired for his carefree attitude and
   sense of adventure, a free-spirited maverick eager to explore all kicks
   and an inspiration and catalyst for Sal's travels. The novel contains
   five parts, three of them describing road trips with Moriarty. The
   narrative takes place in the years 1947 to 1950, is full of Americana,
   and marks a specific era in jazz history, "somewhere between its
   Charlie Parker Ornithology period and another period that began with
   Miles Davis." The novel is largely autobiographical, Sal being the
   alter ego of the author and Dean standing for Neal Cassady.
