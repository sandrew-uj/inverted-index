   The story begins in May 1863, at the Lidenbrock house in Hamburg,
   Germany. Professor Otto Lidenbrock dashes home to peruse his latest
   antiquarian purchase, an original runic manuscript of an Icelandic saga
   written by Snorre Sturluson, "Heimskringla", a chronicle of the
   Norwegian kings who ruled over Iceland. While leafing through the book,
   Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a coded note written in runic
   script along with the name of a 16th century Icelandic alchemist, Arne
   Saknussemm. (This novel was Verne's first to showcase his love of
   cryptography; coded, cryptic, or incomplete messages would appear as
   plot devices in many of his works, and Verne would take pains to
   explain not only the code itself but also the mechanisms for retrieving
   the original text.) Lidenbrock and Axel transliterate the runic
   characters into Latin letters, revealing a message written in a
   seemingly bizarre code. Lidenbrock deduces that the message is a
   transposition cipher, but achieves results no more meaningful than the
   baffling original.

   Professor Lidenbrock locks everyone in the house and forces himself and
   Axel to go without food until he cracks the code. Axel discovers the
   answer when fanning himself with the deciphered text: Lidenbrock's
   deciphering was correct but simply needed to be read backward in order
   to reveal a paragraph written in rough Latin.^[a] Axel tries to hide
   his discovery from Lidenbrock, afraid of the professor's maniacal
   reactions, but after two days without food, he knuckles under and
   reveals the secret to his uncle. Lidenbrock translates the paragraph, a
   16th century note written by Saknussemm, who claims to have discovered
   a passage to the center of the earth via the crater of Snaefellsjoekull
   in Iceland. In what Axel calls bastardized Latin, the deciphered
   message reads:
   The Runic cryptogram

     In Sneffels Yokulis craterem kem delibat umbra Scartaris Julii intra
     calendas descende, audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges. Kod
     feci. Arne Saknussemm.

   which, when translated into English, reads:

     Go down into the crater of Snaefells Joekull, which Scartaris's
     shadow caresses just before the calends of July, O daring traveler,
     and you'll make it to the center of the earth. I've done so. Arne
     Saknussemm

   Snaefellsjoekull

   A man of astonishing impatience, Lidenbrock departs for Iceland
   immediately, taking the reluctant Axel with him. The latter repeatedly
   tries to reason with his uncle, describing the dangers of descending
   into a volcano that could very possibly reactivate, then putting
   forward several accepted scientific theories as to why the journey is
   flatly impossible. The professor ignores Axel's arguments, and after a
   swift trip via Kiel and Copenhagen, they arrive in Reykjavik. There
   they hire as their guide Icelander Hans Bjelke, a Danish-speaking
   eiderduck hunter, then travel overland to the base of Snaefellsjoekull.

   In late June they reach the volcano, which has three craters. According
   to Saknussemm's message, the route to the earth's center is via the
   crater that's touched by the noontime shadow of a nearby mountain peak,
   Scartaris, just before the end of June. But at that point the weather
   proves too cloudy for any shadows, and Axel hopes this will force his
   uncle to abandon the project and go home. Alas for Axel, the sun
   finally comes out, and Scartaris's shadow indicates the correct crater.

   Reaching the bottom of the crater, the three travelers set off into the
   bowels of the earth, encountering many dangers and strange phenomena.
   After taking a wrong turn, they run short of water and Axel nearly
   perishes, but Hans saves them all by tapping into a subterranean river,
   which shoots out a stream of water that Lidenbrock and Axel name the
   "Hansbach" in the guide's honor. Later on, Axel becomes separated from
   his companions and gets lost deep in the earth. Luckily an odd acoustic
   phenomenon allows him to communicate with the others from a distance,
   and they are soon reunited.

   plesiosaurus.

   Following the course of the Hansbach, the explorers descend many miles
   and reach a cavern of colossal size. It's a genuine underground world
   that's lit by electrically charged gas near its ceiling, is filled by a
   deep subterranean ocean, and surrounded by a rocky coastline that's
   covered with petrified tree trunks, the fossils of prehistoric mammals,
   and gigantic living mushrooms. The travelers build a raft out of
   semipetrified wood and set sail. The professor names the ocean the
   "Lidenbrock Sea" and their takeoff point "Port Graeuben", after his
   goddaughter back home (whom Axel will marry at the novel's end). While
   at sea they encounter the prehistoric fish Pterichthys from the
   Devonian Period and giant marine reptiles from the age of dinosaurs,
   including an Ichthyosaurus, which battles and defeats a Plesiosaurus.
   After the conflict between these monsters, the party reaches an islet
   with a huge geyser, which Lidenbrock names "Axel Island".

   A lightning storm threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but
   instead surprises them by apparently throwing them back onto the very
   coastline they'd previously left. But this section of coast, Axel
   discovers, is the site of an enormous fossil graveyard, including bones
   from the pterodactyl, Megatherium, and mastodon, plus the preserved
   body of a man. Nephew and uncle then venture into a forest featuring
   primitive vegetation from the Tertiary Period; in its depths they are
   stunned to find a prehistoric humanoid more than twelve feet in height
   and watching over a herd of mastodons. Axel isn't sure he has actually
   seen the creature or not, and he argues with Lidenbrock over whether
   it's a manlike ape or an apelike man. In any case, fearing it may be
   hostile, they quickly leave the forest.

   Continuing to explore the coastline, the travelers find a passageway
   marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead, but unfortunately it has been
   blocked by a recent cave-in. The adventurers lay plans to blow the rock
   open with gun cotton, meanwhile paddling their raft out to sea to avoid
   the blast. On executing this scheme, however, they find a seemingly
   bottomless pit beyond the impeding rock and are swept into it as the
   sea rushes down the huge open gap. After spending hours descending at
   breakneck speed, their raft reverses direction and rises inside a
   volcanic chimney that ultimately spews them into the open air. When
   they regain consciousness, they learn that they've been ejected from
   Stromboli, a volcanic island located off Sicily.

   The trio returns to Germany, where Axel and Lidenbrock deduce that the
   electric storm at sea had reversed the poles of their compass -- in
   actuality they hadn't been driven backward but forward to a new shore
   notable for containing gigantic hominids. At home in Hamburg again,
   they enjoy great acclaim; Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the
   great scientists of the day, Axel marries his sweetheart Gretchen, and
   Hans returns to his peaceful, eiderdown-hunting life in Iceland.
