   In humanity's future, a new type of society has been formed after a
   disastrous oil-bug was released upon the planet that killed 98% of the
   human population and left many cities in ruins. The new society is
   composed of about one hundred small post-scarcity, independently run
   city states, spread out across the seven continents, which now have
   different coastlines because of modern-societies' global warming.
   Tally's city is located somewhere in Washington state, west of the
   Cascade Mountains. The new society holds three values at its core:
   Sustainability, Peace, and Equality. The new society promotes these
   values through the use of The Surge, a type of extreme cosmetic surgery
   that all citizens undergo at the age of 16. The Surge transforms
   ordinary humans into paragons of beauty, right down to perfect facial
   symmetry. New Pretties are given access to life in New Pretty Town, the
   innermost part of the city where food, shelter, and entertainment are
   provided by the government free of charge. Within the post-Surge part
   of a persons life, everyone's common beauty inspires peace and equality
   among the citizens.
