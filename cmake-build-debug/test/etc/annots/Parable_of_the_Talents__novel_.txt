   Parable of the Talents is told from the points of view of Lauren Oya
   Olamina and her daughter Larkin Olamina/Asha Vere. The novel consists
   of journal entries by Lauren and passages by Asha Vere. Five years
   after the events of the previous novel Parable of the Sower, Lauren has
   founded a new religious community called Acorn, which is centered
   around her religion Earthseed, which is predicated around the belief
   that humanity's destiny is to travel beyond Earth and live on other
   planets in order for humanity to reach adulthood.

   The novel is set against the backdrop of a dystopian United States that
   has come under the grip of a Christian fundamentalist denomination
   called "Christian America" led by President Andrew Steele Jarret.
   Seeking to restore American power and prestige, and using the slogan
   "Make America Great Again", Jarret embarks on a crusade to cleanse
   America of non-Christian faiths. Slavery has resurfaced with "shock
   collars" being used to control slaves. Virtual reality headsets known
   as "Dreamasks" are also popular since they enable wearers to escape
   their harsh reality.

   During the course of the novel, Acorn is attacked and taken over by
   Christian American "Crusaders" and turned into a re-education camp. For
   the next year and a half, Lauren and the other adults are enslaved and
   forced to wear "shock collars". Their Christian American captors
   exploit them as forced labor under the pretext of "reforming" them.
   Lauren and several of the women are also regularly raped by their
   captors, who regard them as "heathen". In 2035, Lauren and her
   followers eventually rebel and kill their captors. To avoid
   retribution, they are forced to disperse into hiding. By 2036,
   President Jarret is defeated after a single term due to public
   dissatisfaction with the "Alaska-Canada War" and revelations of his
   role in witch burnings.

   Meanwhile, Larkin is adopted by an African American Christian America
   family and renamed "Asha Vere Alexander" after a popular Dreamask hero.
   Unloved and abused by her adoptive parents, Asha grows up never knowing
   who her biological parents are. As an adult, Asha reunites with her
   uncle Marcus "Marc" Duran, who was believed to have perished in the
   events of the previous novel and has since become a Christian America
   minister. With Uncle Marc's help, Larkin becomes an academic historian
   but leaves the Christian faith.

   Unknown to Asha, Uncle Marc had previously re-established contact with
   his long-lost half-sister Lauren. Marc claimed that the "Crusaders"
   were rogue elements who do not represent Christian America. He tells
   Asha that her mother is dead, and never told Lauren he had found her
   daughter. With Jarret's legacy in disgrace, Lauren's Earthseed religion
   grows in popularity in a post-war United States, funding scholarships
   for needy university students and encouraging humanity to leave Earth
   and settle in Alpha Centauri.

   After Asha learns that Lauren is her biological mother, she manages to
   meet with her mother. Though Asha is unable to forgive her mother for
   choosing Earthseed over her, Lauren tells her daughter that her door is
   always open to her. After learning that her half-brother Uncle Marc hid
   the fact that Asha was related to Lauren, Lauren severs all ties with
   her estranged brother. Lauren dies at the age of 81 while watching the
   first shuttles leaving Earth for the starship Christopher Columbus,
   which carries settlers in suspended animation to Alpha Centauri.
