   The Chronicles of Amber is a series of fantasy novels by American
   writer Roger Zelazny. The main series consists of two story arcs, each
   five novels in length. Additionally, there are a number of Amber short
   stories and other works. Four additional prequel books, authorized by
   the Zelazny estate following his death, were authored by John Gregory
   Betancourt.

   The Amber stories take place in two contrasting "true" worlds, Amber
   and Chaos, and in shadow worlds (Shadows) that lie between the two.
   These shadows, including our Earth, are parallel worlds that exist in,
   and were created from, the tension between opposing magical forces of
   Amber and Chaos. The Courts of Chaos are situated at the very edge of
   an Abyss. Members of the royal family of Amber, after walking a Pattern
   that is central to Amber, can travel freely through the Shadows. While
   traveling (shifting) between Shadows, one can alter reality or create a
   new reality by choosing which elements of which Shadows to keep or add,
   and which to subtract. Nobles of the Courts of Chaos who have traversed
   the Logrus are similarly able to travel through Shadow.
