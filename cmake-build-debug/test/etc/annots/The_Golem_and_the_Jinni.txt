   In the Polish town of Konin at the end of the 19th century, a corrupt
   kabbalist named Yehudah Schaalman creates a golem in the shape of a
   woman at the request of young Otto Rotfeld, who seeks a submissive,
   attentive, and curious wife. Rotfeld dies during a subsequent sea
   voyage to New York City, leaving the newly awakened golem in an
   unfamiliar environment. A rabbi in New York takes in the golem and,
   naming her Chava, starts teaching her to pass as human among the
   diverse groups of people living in New York. Meanwhile, a tinsmith in
   New York's Little Syria accidentally frees a jinni from a flask in
   which he has been imprisoned for centuries. With no memory of how he
   was subdued, the jinni is virtually powerless and trapped in human
   form. He takes the name Ahmad and apprentices with the tinsmith while
   searching for a way to return to his natural form.

   Chava and Ahmad eventually meet and become friends, though they have
   different views on being inhuman while living in a human world. Chava
   seeks to be more human and fears losing control and exposing herself,
   whereas Ahmad holds a jaded view towards humanity and engages in
   hedonistic pursuits. Chava and Ahmad's influence on the lives of the
   people around them comes to a climax as Chava's creator comes to New
   York, intent on finding the secret to eternal life. He is discovered
   out to be a reincarnation of the evil sorcerer who trapped Ahmad.
