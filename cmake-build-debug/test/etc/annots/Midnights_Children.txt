   The technique of magical realism finds liberal expression throughout
   the novel and is crucial to constructing the parallel to the country's
   history. The story moves in different parts of the Indian
   Subcontinent. Book One takes us from Srinagar (Kashmir) to Amritsar,
   Agra, Delhi, and Bombay. Book Two starts in Bombay and moves to
   Rawalpindi, Karachi, and the Rann of Kutch. Book Three takes us to
   Dacca and the Sundarbans, back to Delhi, then to Benares -- and finally
   Bombay. Nicholas Stewart in his essay, "Magic realism in relation to
   the post-colonial and Midnight's Children," argues that the "narrative
   framework of Midnight's Children consists of a tale - comprising his
   life story - which Saleem Sinai recounts orally to his wife-to-be
   Padma. This self-referential narrative (within a single paragraph
   Saleem refers to himself in the first person: 'And I, wishing upon
   myself the curse of Nadir Khan...;' and the third: '"I tell you,"
   Saleem cried, "it is true. ..."') recalls indigenous Indian culture,
   particularly the similarly orally recounted Arabian Nights. The
   events in the book also parallel the magical nature of the narratives
   recounted in Arabian Nights (consider the attempt to electrocute Saleem
   at the latrine (p. 353), or his journey in the 'basket of invisibility'
   (p. 383))."

   He also notes that, "the narrative comprises and compresses Indian
   cultural history." "'Once upon a time,' Saleem muses, 'there were
   Radha and Krishna, and Rama and Sita, and Laila and Majnun; also
   (because we are not unaffected by the West) Romeo and Juliet, and
   Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn' (259)." Stewart (citing Hutcheon)
   suggests that Midnight's Children chronologically entwines characters
   from both India and the West, "with post-colonial Indian history to
   examine both the effect of these indigenous and non-indigenous cultures
   on the Indian mind and in the light of Indian independence."
