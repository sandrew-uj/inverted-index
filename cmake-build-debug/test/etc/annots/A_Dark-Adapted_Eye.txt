   Largely set during World War II, the story is told by Faith Severn, who
   at the prompting of a true-crime writer recounts her memories of her
   aunt, the prim, fastidious, and snobbish Vera Hillyard. Vera's life is
   initially centered on her beautiful younger sister, Eden, even to the
   exclusion of her own son, Francis, with whom she has a poor
   relationship. Later, Vera brings up a second son, Jamie, born during
   the war and presumably fathered by Vera's soldier husband, though the
   timing of his birth raises questions. Vera becomes intensely devoted to
   Jamie, while Eden marries the scion of a wealthy family.

   When Eden is unable to have children with her husband, she begins to
   demand custody of Jamie, who she claims is being poorly raised by Vera.
   To the bewilderment and shock of the rest of the family, the custody
   battle escalates to violent levels, leading to tragedy and a series of
   disturbing revelations. Eden's actions drive Vera to a violent
   attack, resulting in Eden's death and Vera's execution for murder.
