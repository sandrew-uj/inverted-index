   When working woman Kay Norris makes the acquaintance of a handsome and
   friendly young man who lives in the same "sliver" building, she does
   not know at first that he is the owner. While keeping a low profile
   himself, he turns out to know an awful lot about the other inhabitants,
   including many of their secrets. It turns out that he is a modern-day
   Peeping Tom who, unknown to everyone, has had surveillance cameras and
   microphones installed in every single apartment, with his own place in
   the building serving as his headquarters. The novel is a murder
   mystery, and the beautiful heroine soon becomes a damsel in distress.
