   A merchant loses all his money when his ships are lost at sea, and is
   forced to move his three daughters to a lonely countryside house called
   Rose Cottage which was left to his youngest, Beauty, in a will, and
   thus is not subject to his creditors. The garden of the house is full
   of strange thorny bushes and vines, which neither of the merchant nor
   his three daughters can identify. Beauty asks in the town and discovers
   that they are the roses the cottage are called after and begins to tend
   them, because she loves gardening and she remembers the smell of her
   mother's rose perfume. Roses are very rare because only great magic or
   great love can grow them. The roses bloom under Beauty's care, and the
   sisters sells wreaths of them in the town. After some time, the
   merchant hears word that one of his ships might have made it back and
   journeys to find out if it's true. He asks his daughters what presents
   they would like him to bring back, and Beauty requests a rose, as her
   bush has not blossomed that year because it has been so cold and rainy
   and miserable.

   The ship had come in, but the creditors had remembered the merchant's
   old debts and seized upon the goods before he could reach them. A man
   who had once worked as his clerk and was now employed by a rival had
   let the merchant stay with him, but his employer found out and demanded
   that he be turned out. Finding that he was nothing but bad luck in that
   city, the merchant refused another offer of aid and set out to make his
   way home on a stout pony allowed to be lent to him, in spite of the
   fierce winter weather. On the way he gets lost in a snow storm, and
   ends up at a magnificent castle where he is given food and shelter. As
   he is leaving he notices a beautiful rose on a table and decides to
   take it back for Beauty. This enrages the castle's owner - a terrifying
   beast. When the merchant explains his actions, the Beast agrees to let
   him go on the condition that Beauty comes to live with him in the
   castle.

   The main part of the book follows the basic plot of the fairy tale
   Beauty and the Beast but with a few alterations: Beauty stays at the
   house for what seems to be seven days, during which she revives the
   roses in the Beast's greenhouse and calls small creatures (bats, birds,
   frogs/toads, hedgehogs) back to the palace, and the Beast has filled
   the roof of his mansion with beautiful paintings. During her time in
   the castle, Beauty dreams every night of her family, and when she
   speaks to the Beast of how real her dreams seem and how strange they
   are, with the amount of time passing in them, he admits to her that
   they are true reflections of reality, and Beauty is distressed to have
   missed so much of her sisters' lives. She begs to be allowed to return
   home to visit, which he allows, but warns her that if she does not
   return to him by placing a petal on her tongue before the last petal
   falls from the rose he gives her, he will die.

   When Beauty returns to the Beast and declares her love for him, she is
   given a choice. Either the Beast returns to his human form and regains
   his wealth and power, thereby also returning her family to their former
   status, or he stays as is and they live a peaceful peasant life in the
   village. Told that their names would be spoken throughout the land if
   she chooses the former, she asks how they will be spoken, and on
   hearing that it would be in fear and dread her choice is easily made.
   The pair return home to Rose Cottage, to Jeweltongue and Lionheart and
   the merchant, and all three girls are married to their respective
   beaus.
