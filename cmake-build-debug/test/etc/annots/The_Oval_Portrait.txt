   The tale begins with an injured narrator (the story offers no further
   explanation of his impairment) seeking refuge in an abandoned mansion
   in the Apennines. The narrator spends his time admiring the paintings
   that decorate the strangely shaped room and perusing a volume, found
   upon a pillow, that describes them.

   Upon moving the candle closer to the book, the narrator immediately
   discovers a before-unnoticed painting depicting the head and shoulders
   of a young girl. The picture inexplicably enthralls the narrator "for
   an hour perhaps". After steady reflection, he realizes that the
   painting's "absolute life-likeliness' of expression is the captivating
   feature. The narrator eagerly consults the book for an explanation of
   the picture. The remainder of the story henceforth is a quote from this
   book - a story within a story.

   The book describes a tragic story involving a young maiden of "the
   rarest beauty". She loved and wedded an eccentric painter who cared
   more about his work than anything else in the world, including his
   wife. The painter eventually asked his wife to sit for him, and she
   obediently consented, sitting "meekly for many weeks" in his turret
   chamber. The painter worked so diligently at his task that he did not
   recognize his wife's fading health, as she, being a loving wife,
   continually "smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly". As the painter
   neared the end of his work, he let no one enter the turret chamber and
   rarely took his eyes off the canvas, even to watch his wife. After many
   weeks had passed, he finally finished his work. As he looked on the
   completed image, however, he felt appalled, as he exclaimed, "This is
   indeed Life itself!" Thereafter, he turned suddenly to regard his bride
   and discovered that she had died.
