   At the beginning of Promise of Blood, Field Marshal Tamas has just
   committed a brutal coup against Adro's monarchy. To ensure the success
   of his coup, he orders the assassination of every member of the Royal
   Cabal, a cadre of mages called 'Privileged' bound to serve the kings of
   the Nine Nations. The Privileged, as they are killed, all utter the
   same mysterious phrase: "You can't break Kresimir's Promise". Concerned
   about this recurrence and what it could mean, Tamas summons Adamat, a
   former soldier and police inspector who is now a private investigator,
   to the Skyline Palace in the center of the capital city of Adopest, as
   the coup is unfolding. The field marshal instructs Adamat to find what
   the words means and what threat it could mean for the future. Tamas
   finds and arrests Manhouch XII, the current King of Adro, and his queen
   while his soldiers round up the nobles present in the city. The next
   day, Manhouch, his queen and many of the arrested nobles are executed
   by guillotine, ending the monarchy in Adro and leading the country on
   the path to civil war. During the purge, a young laundress named Nila,
   who worked for one of Manhouch's cousings, is saved from rape by a
   sergeant named Olem, and escapes the purge with the duke's son, Jakob.

   Adamat conducts his investigation while also dealing with his own
   issues; his attempt to start a printing press business had failed and
   he had fallen into debt with some dangerous people, reporting to a
   mysterious employer. In order to ensure their safety from his creditors
   but also to protect from the unrest threatening Adro, Adamt sends his
   wife and children away from Adopest. As he researches the source of the
   Royal Cabal's mysterious words, he discovers that all the books which
   could have answered his questions have had pages removed, suggesting
   someone did not want them to find out about it. Adamat eventually
   travels to the South Pike, a large mountain to the south of Adro where
   he meets with the last remaining member of the Royal Cabal, Privileged
   Borbador. He tells him that 'Kresimir's Promise' was a story told among
   Privileged Cabals and which comes from the Time of Kresimir, an age in
   the world's distant past when the god Kresimir and the saint siblings
   came down and founded the Nine Nations. When Kresimir had left to
   resume his travels between the stars, he promised the nine kings he had
   appointed that he would return if their lines were ever overthrown.
   Neither Adamat nor Tamas believe the superstition, believing that the
   time of gods had ended when Kresimir left if it had even happened at
   all. Adamat nevertheless discover from Borbador that a curse was placed
   on the Cabals to ensure that, if their king was killed, they would be
   compelled to destroy their killer.

   Taniel Two-Shot, Tamas's son, returns to Adopest shortly after the
   coup, accompanied by a Fatrastan savage named Ka-Poel. Taniel, like
   Tamas and several of his officers and soldiers, are Powder Mages,
   humans with the ability to metabolize gunpowder and use it as fuel for
   various magical powers, including telekinesis and the manipulation of
   gunpowder, such as causing it to explode spontaneously. Considered an
   anomaly by most sorcerers in the Nine, the Adran military has started
   relying on powder mages and using them as sharpshooters. Taniel, who
   has a strained relationship with his father since his mother's death,
   has been fighting in the Fatrastan War of Independence from the kingdom
   of Kez. Back in Adopest, he is instructed by his father to find an
   uncommonly powerful member of the Royal Cabal who managed to escape
   during the coup. To assist him, Tamas assigns a Privileged mercenary
   named Julene, who Taniel struggles to get on with. Taniel, Julene and
   Ka-Poel corner the Privileged, a woman named Rozalia (who had
   previously helped Adamat in his investigation), at Adopest University.
   Julene and Rozalia, who seemingly have a history, engage in a battle of
   magic of such scale that Taniel begins to wonder about their true
   nature. Following these events, Tamas gives Taniel another mission: to
   find and kill Privileged Borbador to prevent him from completing the
   curse. Despite Taniel's reticence, Julene is assigned to go with him to
   South Pike.

   In Adopest, Tamas forms a governing council to govern Adro until such
   time they can establish a permanent replacement for the monarchy. The
   councillors are all men and women who had been involved in the planning
   of the coup alongside Tamas: Ricard Tumblar, the leader of the Warriors
   of Labour (Adro's largest union); Lady Winceslav, an Adran noblewoman
   who leads a powerful mercenary company known as the Wings of Adom;
   Ondraus the Reeve, responsible for Adro's finances; a eunuch
   representing the Proprietor, a major figure in the Adran underworld;
   and Arch-Diocel Charlemund, the leader of the Adran branch of the
   Kresim Church. The first challenge for the coup plotters comes when a
   royalist uprising twenty thousand strong attempts to reestablish the
   monarchy with young Jakob (the boy saved by Nila during the purge of
   the nobles) as king, the remaining nobles to serve as his regents.
   Tamas's forces put down the rebellion and Jakob is taken and seemingly
   executed. Nila, angered by the boy's death, joins Tamas's service to
   get close to the field marshal and kill him. She is stopped by Olem,
   who has been chosen as Tamas's bodyguard due to his ability to go
   without sleep, who reveals that Jakob is still alive and will be sent
   to the countryside to be raised unaware of his claim to the vacant
   throne. Nila tries to free Jakob but discovers he has been taken by a
   shadowy figure called Lord Vetas, who coerces her into joining them as
   the boy's nanny.

   After the royalist uprising, Tamas and his council prepare to receive a
   delegation from the neighbouring kingdom of Kez, a longtime rival of
   Adro. King Manhouch had been preparing to sign accords with Kez,
   effectively turning Adro into a vassal state in exchange for gold to
   pay off his mounting debts. When the delegation reaches Adopest, its
   leader is revealed to be Duke Nikslaus, a Kez Privileged who had
   ordered the execution of Tamas's wife Erika when she had been caught
   saving powder mages from Kez persecution. Tamas throws Nikslaus into
   the Adsea and, aware the move was designed by the Kez king to provoke a
   war with Adro, prepares for war. Sometime after the failed negotiation,
   a Warden (a human mutated by magic and used by the Kez as guards for
   their Privileged) unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate Tamas in the
   secret lair beneath the Skyline Palace where he and his co-conspirators
   had planned the coup. As only he and the members of the council knew
   where he would be, Tamas hires Adamat again to discover who among them
   is working with the Kez.

   On South Pike Mountain, Taniel tracks Borbador but, at the last moment,
   cannot bring himself to kill him as they had been brought up together
   and remain best friends. When Taniel approches Borbador, they are
   attacked by an unusually fierce and strong cave lion. Taniel, Borbador
   and Ka-Poel fight it off with difficulty, Ka-Poel's abilities as a
   Bone-eye sorcerer giving them an edge. Borbador reveals to them that
   the cave lion had been Julene, who wasn't a Privileged as they had
   believe. She belonged to an ancient cast of immortal sorcerers known as
   Predeii. It had been the Predeii who had summoned Kresimir and assisted
   him in establishing the Nine with themselves as the main advisers to
   its royal families. The Predeii had been culled and virtually
   disappeared in the aftermath of a war involing all Nine Nations called
   the Bleakening. Julene, eager for more power, has been planning to
   summon Kresimir back to the world and use him to establish herself as
   the main new power. Shortly after the confronation, the group find the
   Kez army marching on South Pike, its Royal Cabal coming to assist
   Julene in reaching its peak where sthey will summon Kresimir. Alongside
   Adro's Mountain Watch, Taniel, Borbador and Ka-Poel fight for months to
   hold off the Kez forces.
