   Shann Lantee is lucky to be alive. He had sneaked out of the small
   Terran base on the planet Warlock in the Circe system to find two
   artificially evolved wolverines, Taggi and his mate Togi, and bring
   them back to the base before anyone notices that they are missing.
   While he is gone a force of Throgs, implacably hostile insectoid
   aliens, attacks the base and kills all of its occupants. Shann moves
   across country with the wolverines and sees a downed scoutship explode
   and destroy a Throg flying disc.

   A wounded Throg confronts Shann, but a well-aimed rock kills it.
   Shann's rescuer is Ragnar Thorvald, who survived the crash of the
   scoutship and turned it into a booby trap. Together the two men leave
   the scene and begin living off the land in a way that implies a native
   people, not Terrans. Days later they make a night raid on the base, now
   occupied by Throgs, and they and the wolverines barely escape. On a
   raft they head for the distant sea, where they expect to find refuge.

   After evading a Throg search party, they reach their goal. Thorvald
   displays a coin-like disc that suddenly puts him into a trance and
   takes control of his mind. Shann knocks the disc out of Thorvald's
   hand, and Thorvald recovers consciousness, but the disc leaves a
   compulsion in his mind: they must travel across water to a certain
   island. They build a makeshift canoe and reach the island, but
   Thorvald's mind is again assaulted and he leaves the island, marooning
   Shann and the wolverines there.

   Shann seeks to escape from the island, to return to the mainland with
   the wolverines. But he finds that he is also vulnerable to telepathic
   mind-control; during his sleep he sabotages his own work. He sets a
   trap, hoping to catch his telepathic assailant, and soon finds a small
   dragon-like humanoid caught in it. The creature is physically delicate,
   but telepathically powerful. It is also female. She takes him to a
   cavern to meet three other Warlockians, who want to find out who and
   what he is.

   In a fog-filled cavern Shann must confront old memories somehow made
   physically real as long as he believes in them. He has to remain
   focused on what is true in order to survive. During the ordeal he
   reunites with Thorvald, who refers to the natives as Wyverns. Together
   the two men escape from the cavern and Shann saves a young Wyvern from
   a sea monster.

   Now the Wyverns give Shann a mission. He must extract a wounded Throg
   from a cave in which it has taken refuge. The Wyverns are unable to do
   this themselves, because the Throg's mind is so primitive that the
   Wyvern's mind-control techniques do not affect it. Shann manages to get
   the wounded Throg out but is captured by a group of Throgs sent to
   rescue their wounded comrade. The Throgs take Shann back to the Terran
   base and order him to call the colonization ship that is coming, to
   lure it down so that the Throgs can kill the passengers and crew. Shann
   manages to warn the ship and to draw a Patrol cruiser to the base,
   dooming the Throgs. Before the Throgs can begin torturing Shann to
   death, Thorvald and the Wyverns envelop them in a fog that realizes
   their worst fears and kills them. Together the humans from the ship and
   the Wyverns defeat the Throg colonization force utterly.

   After his wounds have healed, Shann discovers that he and Thorvald are
   to form the core of an embassy established on Warlock to maintain
   contact with the Wyverns.
