   In The Second Angel, passages of narrative by an omniscient narrator
   alternate with lengthy, discursive commentaries on the characters, and
   complex observations on human nature and blood by a first-person,
   intrusive narrator, who claims to be the omniscient narrator telling
   the story, but deliberately refrains from disclosing his or her
   identity until the last chapter.

   It is the late 21st century, when 80% of mankind have been infected
   with a virus called HPV2 (human parvovirus 2), or P2, whose spread was
   accelerated with the discovery and use of synthetic blood. P2 disrupts
   the blood's ability to carry hemoglobin around the body, greatly
   shortening the host's life. The only known cure for P2 is a complete
   blood transfusion with healthy blood, coupled with a dose of the drug
   ProTryptol 14. With only 20 percent of the world's population free of
   P2, the price of a litre of healthy blood has reached almost two
   million dollars.

   In the novel, blood has replaced gold and diamonds as a valuable
   commodity (gold was extracted in great quantity from the sea and is now
   valued at about $200 a kilogram). Uninfected people reside in "Clean
   Bill of Health" (CBH) zones within cities to avoid contact with the
   sick, for vamping (murder for the purpose of blood theft) is a major
   risk for healthy individuals. Standard procedure for those who are
   uninfected is to perform autologous donations to enable them to
   completely replace it in the event of becoming infected.

   The healthy blood reserves are kept in state-of-the-art blood banks
   around the world, the largest being the First National Blood Bank on
   the Moon. Due to the high incidence of theft in these banks, they are
   guarded by the most sophisticated security systems. The greatest
   designer of blood banks is Dana Dallas, who works for one of the
   largest security firms in the world, and has designed several
   state-of-the-art blood banks, including the First National Blood Bank.
   His ingenious security systems have never before been bypassed or
   robbed.

   His boss, Simon King, grows concerned when he hears that Dallas's
   daughter Caro has been diagnosed with thalassemia, an illness that can
   only be cured by a lifetime of regular healthy blood transfusions, as
   despite his high position in the company Dallas would never be able to
   afford to pay for this treatment. Rather than risk Dallas leaking
   industrial secrets to the highest bidder, he orders Rimmer, the
   company's security officer, to kill Dallas, his wife and his daughter.
   His wife and daughter are indeed killed, but by chance Dallas survives
   and realises that the company had meant to kill him too.

   Dallas escapes to relative safety outside the city's Clean Bill of
   Health zone, hiding in a hyperbaric hotel. Dallas is now set on revenge
   and recruits a team funded by himself and a mafia boss to rob the First
   National Blood Bank on the moon. The robbery goes according to plan
   with only a few complications.

   On the way back to Earth, Dallas is told by his personal computer that
   a quantum computer has actually evolved in the bloodbank; the
   intrusive, omniscient narrator turns out to be this computer (a
   super-computer that opportunistically used the millions of litres of
   blood stocked in one place to re-create itself, using the unique
   storage and duplicating capacity of DNA); it has gained access to the
   memories of the characters by "merging" with them when they had a blood
   transfusion. The blood contains extremely advanced nanomachines which
   activate an ability to live longer, and be far more resistant to human
   limitations such as the need for food, water and oxygen; it enables
   them to survive in a state of suspended animation for years at a time.
   The supercomputer wanted to combine humans and computers with
   nanomachines in order to explore the galaxy. While Dallas and his crew
   are asleep on their way back to Earth, the supercomputer (unbeknownst
   to the humans) activates their new hibernation state and sets their
   course to deep space.
