   Nuclear-apocalypse survivor Ann Burden lives an agrarian life on her
   family's valley farmstead, sheltered from radioactive contaminants by
   rocky hillsides, favorable weather patterns, and an abundant ground-fed
   water supply. One day, Ann encounters refugee John Loomis. He claims to
   be an engineer, who, aided by medicines and a radiation suit, walked
   from a distant government bunker to Ann's valley. Loomis bathes in
   contaminated water, and immediately sickens, but is nursed back to
   health by Ann, who welcomes him into her farmhouse.

   Loomis regains his strength, and gradually, becomes part of Ann's
   humble rustic life. He helps Ann pump diesel from local petroleum pumps
   and gets the farm's long-disused tractor running to expand her gardens
   for the winter. Ann tells Loomis about her parents and younger brother
   who left the valley to find other survivors... but never returned.
   Loomis speculates hydro-electricity might be generated from the nearby
   waterfall, using a water-wheel fashioned from the Burden church's
   planks and beams. Ann is uncomfortable with this proposal, citing her
   father's involvement as preacher and her deeply-held Christian beliefs.
   Loomis chooses to not pursue the project further.

   Ann and Loomis grow closer, cultivating crops and preparing for
   long-term habitation. Their domestic accord is marred by occasional
   tensions, notably involving matters of religion and Loomis' drinking.
   The two come to the verge of initiating a sexual relationship, but
   Loomis demurs, claiming a sexual relationship will change them, and he
   needs more time.

   Mysterious phenomena (including stolen food supplies and a
   half-glimpsed shadowy figure) culminate in the arrival of a third
   survivor, Caleb. Although Ann welcomes Caleb into the farmhouse, Loomis
   resents Caleb by citing the race card... "...whites belong with
   whites...". Loomis questions Caleb's backstory and motives; Caleb
   repeatedly emphasizes the religious connection he shares with Ann (in
   stark contrast to Loomis).

   The three survivors slowly settle into a marginally-stable partnership.
   Both men relate post-apocalyptic horrors they witnessed before reaching
   the valley; Loomis describes a radiation-sickened child begging him for
   death; later, he privately confides to Ann his belief the dying boy was
   her long-absent brother; Loomis confesses to the murder of the child.
   Caleb pressures Ann to go forward with the water-wheel project, and
   work commences on tearing down her father's church for materials.
   Perceiving their mutual attraction, Loomis awkwardly gives Ann consent
   to pursue a romantic relationship with Caleb, but belies his grief and
   anger in losing Ann through a racist remark. Shortly thereafter,
   following a celebratory dinner, a heavily-intoxicated Loomis tells Ann
   he loves her before passing out in a bedroom in Ann's home. After
   failing to wake Loomis, seeming to want his affection, Ann joins Caleb
   in the adjoining bathroom, where the two engage in sexual activity.

   Further tensions arise between Caleb and Loomis following the sexual
   encounter. The two men finish the water-wheel, moving it and its wooden
   flume into place atop the waterfall. Encumbered by the bulky radiation
   suit, Caleb slips twice during his rope-assisted climb up the slick
   mossy cliff-side. During the second slip, the two men silently lock
   eyes, both holding the rope, while Caleb teeters on the cliff's edge.

   Loomis returns to the farmhouse alone. Ann apologizes for her earlier
   indiscretion; Loomis claims Caleb left in search of other settlements.
   Ann takes this news badly, chasing after Caleb but not finding him, and
   lapses into a sullen silence. The farmhouse's electric lights and
   refrigeration are restored. Ann realizes Loomis moved her beloved
   church organ and three pews into the barn. Ann, playing a hymn,
   exchanges a distrustful glance at Loomis who is sitting and clasping
   his hands, as the scene fades to black.
