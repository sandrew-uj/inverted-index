   Modern science has discovered a way to rejuvenate people. It is just
   like immortality, but the rejuvenation process causes the human brain
   to be "restarted"-effectively losing all its former memories so the
   recipient starts life anew, like a blank slate.

   The world has reached a stage where there is very little privacy, and
   the rigors of modern society invade just about every corner of life.
   Even still, there are outcasts in remote areas who find a way of
   surviving without being part of the wider society.

   The main character, Benny Rice, struggles to maintain a low profile,
   even going so far as to quit and change jobs when offered a promotion;
   his personal history mysteriously dates back to a series of dead ends.
   No matter what job he has had, he always quits before getting promoted.
   An amicable, friendly sort, he is in for quite a surprise when an
   unlikely friend, a multi-billionairess, is so taken with his gentleness
   and kindness that she decides to write him into her will as the
   principal co-beneficiary to her vast estate of billions. The "Trust" is
   a foundation that encourages the successful, the accomplished, and the
   intelligent--basically the cream of the crop--to undergo the
   rejuvenation process. However, her will requires the Rejuvenation
   Foundation give Benny exactly the same treatment reserved to the
   successful and rich. Public notoriety is exactly what Benny Rice does
   not want. He only wants to be left alone and allowed to go on with his
   quiet and peaceful life in a position in life that is least subject to
   public scrutiny.
