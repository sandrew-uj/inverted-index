   The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories concern the lives of two larcenous
   but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of
   Nehwon. In The Swords of Lankhmar, the duo is hired by the city of
   Lankhmar to protect its grain fleets, which have become prey to a
   mysterious threat. A sea serpent ridden by an explorer from another
   world is encountered, but the true foes prove to be legions of
   intelligent rats. Returning to Lankhmar, the protagonists find the
   whole city besieged by the rats. The Mouser, magically shrunken to rat
   size, spies out their plans, but the rats' victory appears certain
   until an intervention by the Gods of Lankhmar and the rats' own ancient
   enemies occurs.
