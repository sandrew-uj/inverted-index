   In search of fuel, highway patrol officer-turned-survivalist Max
   Rockatansky (Bren Foster) journeys to the Plains of Silence with his
   dog. His runs into the War Boys led by Scabrous Scrotus (Travis
   Willingham), son of Immortan Joe (Fred Tatasciore) and ruler of
   Gastown. The War Boys run Max off the road and steal his car and
   supplies, leaving him to die in the desert. Max chases them and
   challenges Scrotus to a duel on the Land Mover. Max stabs Scrotus in
   the head with his own chainsaw but Scrotus kicks out Max and his
   dog.

   With his dog, Max obtains a weapon and clothes from a dead Wastelander.
   In the desert, Max finds a hunchbacked mechanic named Chumbucket (Jason
   Spisak) who calls him the Driver. Chumbucket leads Max to Scrotus and
   the War Boys and tells him that he is building a car, the Magnum Opus,
   but it lacks critical parts; Max agrees to search for them. Max must
   first liberate Wasteland leaders' territories from the War Boys: Jeet
   (Josh Keaton), whose stronghold is in an old lighthouse, and Gut Gash
   (Liam O'Brien), whose followers believe that they will be protected
   from a flood in their ship stronghold. His stronghold is the remains of
   an oil tanker. He must penetrate a massive gate protected by War Boys,
   using the Magnum Opus outfitted with an exploding harpoon. Max and
   Chumbucket must then save Pink Eye (Adrienne Barbeau), a woman whose
   mechanical skill rivals Chumbucket's, from an invasion of her silo base
   led by Stank Gum--one of Scrotus' Top Dogs.

   Searching for a V8 engine for the Magnum Opus, Max learns about a race
   in Gastown with a Big Chief V8 as a prize. After winning the race
   against Stank Gum (Yuri Lowenthal) and defeating the fighter Tenderloin
   in a Thunderdome duel, Max receives the engine and the concubine Hope
   (Courtenay Taylor). His victory is short-lived; Scrotus recognizes Max
   and attacks him. After he is shot with a crossbow and thrown down a
   mine shaft, Max is saved by Hope, who takes him to the Organic Mechanic
   and Scab (Orion Acaba)--also known as the Bloodbag. While Max is
   undergoing surgery, he has a hallucination that his wedding to Hope is
   officiated by Chumbucket and a man with a dog's head. When he wakes up,
   he and Hope steal the Big Chief; they drive to the temple of Deep Friah
   (Robin Atkin Downes), a friendly fire cultist.

   At the temple, Hope asks Max to find her daughter, Glory (Madison
   Carlon), who had fled to Buzzard territory. He travels to the Underdune
   and rescues Glory from the Buzzards. Returning, he discovers that
   Chumbucket took the Magnum Opus to his old home. Max follows him in one
   of Deep Friah's cars, but learns that Scrotus and Stank Gum tortured
   Chumbucket, who revealed Hope and Glory's location and their ties to
   Max. Max kills Stank Gum, rushes back to the temple and finds Hope
   hanged to death and Glory tortured on the floor. Glory dies, and Max
   swears vengeance against Scrotus.

   He returns to Gastown and learns Scrotus' location from Scab. Max and
   Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands, and use
   the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed to the edge of
   a cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus
   but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's
   protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed;
   Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed.
   Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the
   game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw
   blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. Max enters the Interceptor
   and places a picture of his family on the dashboard as he heads off.
