   The novel explores a range of possible attitudes toward space
   exploration and science in the early twenty-first century in which he
   lays down his concerns about anti-intellectualism and the loss of the
   pioneering spirit in modern American politics and culture. In Titan,
   the United States is ruled by a fundamentalist Christian President
   named Xavier Maclachlan who, believing Earth is the centre of the
   universe, orders the equal treatment of the Ptolemaic model of the
   solar system in high school curricula, all the while youth culture goes
   into a rebellious downward spiral with the widespread adoption of
   digital entertainment technology. Due to its far-right isolationist
   policies, the United States have severed ties with the rest of the
   world (including within themselves with seceding nation-states),
   especially while tensions grow with the emerging power of China, which
   is engaged in a determined bid to gain control of space after the
   American Shuttle program comes crashing down with the loss of Columbia
   (but not in the same way as actual events. In this timeline, instead of
   disintegrating on re-entry the shuttle makes an irreparable crash
   landing with the loss of two of the crew), and NASA has no public or
   political support to help recover from the accident. Consequently,
   under Maclachlan's executive plans, the US military merges with the
   space agency for its resources to be diverted into defence spending,
   including using its space-faring vehicles as weapons platforms and
   forcing NASA to develop ethnically-targeted biological weapons tailored
   to attack Han Chinese.

   Amid this negative climate and seeing no future for themselves after
   the permanent shutdown of the space program or for the decadent future
   of humanity, a small team of scientists and astronauts must persuade
   NASA to fund a crewed mission to Titan to confirm findings of life from
   the Cassini and to rejuvenate interest in space exploration to the
   world. They do so by recycling older spacecraft for several purposes:
   space shuttle Atlantis is refitted to carry cargo into orbit as well as
   a restored Saturn V for construction of the main ship (a heavily
   modified version of Discovery using the Shuttle OMS engines for
   chemical propulsion and powered by a TOPAZ nuclear reactor), using
   habitat modules from the mothballed International Space Station, and
   Apollo re-entry capsules are adapted to become Titan landers. On the
   day of the last launch to begin the mission, with the shuttle Endeavour
   ready to carry the crew to space, an insane USAF general driven by
   shallow militarism and hatred for space exploration tries to shoot down
   the shuttle during lift off. Despite damage sustained from an
   anti-satellite missile fired from a restored X-15, Endeavour
   successfully makes it into orbit, and the five crew members begin their
   six-year journey to Saturn by following the gravity-assisted
   Interplanetary Transport Network.

   En route, one crew member dies after a solar storm. The use of a CELSS
   greenhouse for life support provides a continuous food supply, and the
   astronauts rely on vegetables, grain and fruit from the greenhouse as
   they travel on, and dispose of waste via supercritical water oxidation.
   But things take a dark turn as funding and support for resupply and
   Earth-return retrieval are cut by Maclachlan's administration (proposed
   and carried out by the very same men that tried to shoot the shuttle
   down), leaving the team with no hope for survival beyond what they may
   find on Titan. Once they reach Saturn and prepare to land on Titan's
   surface, another crew member is lost during the landing procedure with
   another effectively crippled. Titan is discovered to be a bleak,
   freezing dwarf-planet containing liquid ethane oceans, a sticky
   mud-like surface composed of tholins, and a climate which includes a
   thick atmosphere of purple organic compounds falling like snow from the
   clouds; and the only traces of life they find are fossilised remains of
   microbic bacteria similar to those recovered from Martian meteorites.
   The remaining astronauts relay their findings back to a largely
   uninterested Earth.

   Meanwhile, the Chinese, to retaliate for biological attacks by the US,
   cause a huge explosion next to an asteroid (2002OA), with the aim of
   deflecting it into Earth orbit and threatening the world with targeted
   precision strikes in the future. Unfortunately, their calculations are
   wrong as they didn't take into account the size of the asteroid which
   could cause a Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The asteroid
   strikes Earth, critically damaging the planetary ecosystem. The Titan
   team members are presumably the last humans left alive.

   As the surviving astronauts slowly die of disease and in-fighting, they
   decide to try to ensure life will continue to survive: they take a
   flask of bacteria and drop it into a crater filled with liquid water,
   in the hope that some form of life will develop.

   The novel's final sequence depicts the final two crew members returned
   to life through some unspecified alien process on Titan where they
   died, several billion years in the future. The sun has entered its red
   giant phase, warming the Saturnian system and aiding the evolution of
   life, in the form of strange, intelligent beetle-like creatures, on
   Titan. The astronauts watch as the creatures build a fleet of starships
   to seed new solar systems before the expanding sun boils off the
   surface of the moon.
