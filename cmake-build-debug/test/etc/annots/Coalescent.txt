   The book consists of four distinct parts. The primary purpose of part
   one is the introduction of the characters, in ancient Britain and the
   present. Part two introduces a modern first-person view of the Order in
   Rome while following Regina's budding legacy centuries before. Part
   three hosts the clash and resolution of Poole and the Order's
   realities. Part four is a look eons into Humanity's Expansion into the
   Universe and provides a conclusion in George Poole's present.
