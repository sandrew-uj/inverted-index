   The inspiration for the story was Tolstoy's reminiscences of his stay
   in Como, Italy, in 1838. He wrote of this to his wife in April 1872,
   mentioning the villa Remondi, a girl named Pepina and other
   details. On April 9, 1841, Tolstoy read The Vampire at Vladimir
   Sollogub's; the reading was mentioned by Pyotr Pletnyov in a letter to
   Yakov Grot. In early May 1841 Tolstoy sent the manuscript to censor
   Aleksandr Nikitenko to be reviewed. On May 15 he was granted permission
   to publish it.

   The novella was poorly received by critics, discouraging Tolstoy from
   publishing three other vampire-themed works that he had written at the
   time. One of these, a story titled "Amena", was published in 1846,
   while the other two were only published posthumously. Tolstoy's
   writing on the subject of vampires was at least partly influenced by
   The Vampyre by John William Polidori, which had been published in
   Russian translation in Moscow in 1828.
