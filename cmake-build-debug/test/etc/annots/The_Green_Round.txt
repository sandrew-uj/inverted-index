   The Green Round is a horror novel by Welsh author Arthur Machen. It was
   originally published by Ernest Benn Limited in 1933. The first U.S.
   edition was published by Arkham House in 1968 in an edition of 2,058
   copies. It was the only book by Machen to be published by Arkham House.

   Critic S.T. Joshi has referred to the novel as "a drearily verbose and
   unfocussed rehashing of old themes".^[1]

   According to the Friends of Arthur Machen website, "Machen's final
   full-length work of fiction is judged a failure by some. However, in
   this work, Machen's earlier exploration of the fantastic moves outward
   to embrace the absurd, of Kafka, Camus and Sartre. Not recommended for
   devotees of gothic and horror, but of potential fascination for the
   rest of us." [1]
