   The novel describes escalating phases of what appears to be an invasion
   of Earth by aliens, as told through the eyes of Mike Watson, who works
   for the English Broadcasting Company (EBC) with his wife and
   co-reporter Phyllis. A major role is also played by Professor Alastair
   Bocker - more clear-minded and far-sighted about the developing crisis
   than everybody else, but with the habit of telling brutally unvarnished
   and unwanted truths.

   Mike and Phyllis are witness to several major events of the invasion,
   which proceeds in a series of drawn-out phases; it in fact takes years
   before the bulk of humanity even realise that their world has been
   invaded.

   In the first phase, objects from outer space land in the oceans. Mike
   and Phyllis happen to see five of the "fireballs" falling into the sea,
   from the ship where they are sailing on their honeymoon. Eventually the
   distribution of the objects' landing points - always at ocean depths,
   never on land - implies intelligence.

   The aliens are speculated to come from a gas giant, and thus can only
   survive under conditions of extreme pressures in which humans would be
   instantly crushed. The deepest parts of the oceans are the only parts
   of Earth in any way useful to them, and they presumably have no need or
   use for the dry land or even the shallower parts of the seas. Bocker
   puts forward the theory that the two species could co-exist
   indefinitely, hardly noticing each other's presence.

   Humanity nevertheless feels threatened by this new phenomenon -
   particularly since the newcomers show signs of intensive work to adapt
   the ocean deeps to their needs. A British bathysphere is sent down to
   investigate, and is destroyed by the aliens with the loss of two lives.
   The British government responds by exploding a nuclear device in the
   same location.

   Unfortunately for the humans, the aliens' technology proves formidable;
   an American attack ends in disaster. Moreover, humanity is not united
   in the face of the mounting threat - the Cold War between West and East
   is well under way, with the two sides often suspiciously attributing
   the effects of the alien attacks to their human opponents, or refusing
   to co-operate because of their different political ideals.

   Phase two of the war starts when ships all over the world begin to be
   attacked by unknown weapons and are rapidly sunk, causing havoc to the
   world economy. Shortly after, the aliens also start "harvesting" the
   land by sending up biological "sea tanks", which capture humans from
   coastal settlements, for reasons that are never made clear; the Watsons
   witness one of these assaults on a Caribbean island. These attacks are
   eventually met with sufficiently strong retaliation from humanity that
   they become far less frequent.

   And so, in the final phase, the aliens begin melting the polar ice
   caps, causing sea levels to rise. London and other ports are flooded
   (the government relocates to Harrogate), causing widespread social and
   political collapse. The Watsons cover the story for the EBC until the
   radio (and organised social and political life in general) ceases to
   exist, whereupon they can only try to survive and escape a flooded
   London, relocating to a Cornish holiday cottage which due to the floods
   now exists on an island in its own right. Other coastal countries are
   also disastrously affected - there is a reference to masses of Dutch
   refugees fleeing into Germany, having "lost their centuries-long war
   with the sea".

   Ultimately, scientists in Japan develop an underwater ultrasonic weapon
   that kills the aliens. The population has been reduced to between a
   fifth and an eighth of its pre-invasion level, and the world's climate
   has been significantly changed, with water levels 120 feet higher than
   before.
