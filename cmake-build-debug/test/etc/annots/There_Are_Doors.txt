   Mr. Green awakes to find that his girlfriend, Lara Morgan, has left
   their apartment. He battles a hangover to find a cryptic note left by
   her, dispensing little but a warning against entering certain
   "significant" doors and nonsensical instructions for leaving them if
   passed through. Green immediately leaves to search for the woman, whom
   he has known for only a few days but has already grown to love. His
   quest takes him through one such door to an alternate world, made
   apparent to Green by conspicuous elements such as its unusual currency.
   An accident lands Green in a psychiatric hospital, where he meets a
   radical from his world using the name William North (a patient), a
   boxer named Joe Joeseph and his manager Eddie Walsh (also a patient).

   North organizes an escape from the Hospital, accompanied by Green and
   exploited by Walsh, who makes his own escape. The two take refuge at
   the Grand Hotel in the outskirts of the city, while Green begins to
   realize what a dangerous man he has been indebted to. North brings him
   to a play accompanied by members of his revolutionary group which is
   raided by police. Green and North narrowly escape capture and death,
   though they lose each other.

   Green returns to his hotel paranoid of capture by the police. He finds
   that the doctor he consults for minor burns suffered during the raid
   and subsequent fire at the theater, the waitress at the hotel
   restaurant, and even the stylist at the hair salon beneath it all seem
   to work for the police organization that is tracking him. He leaves the
   hotel hoping to learn more, but is locked out upon his return and must
   accept a car ride from the waitress, Fanny. They go to an Italian
   restaurant which Green recognizes as being from his world. He and Fanny
   discuss the little they know about North's gang, the two worlds, and
   Lara.

   The alternate world is nearly identical to his, the one of contemporary
   America, save for a few societal and physical disparities. The people
   from "There" (as Green comes to think of it) are physically identical
   to those from Here, but for that the men naturally die from sex.
   Technology seems to be generally inferior There, although some
   anomalies such as seemingly magical and remarkably articulate robotic
   dolls exist, perhaps invented to suit matriarchal needs. Roads and
   buildings seem to be in similar places, though occupied by different
   establishments and patrons. Time passes much more quickly Here,
   although they both seem to be in the same general era. There is no
   indication when passing between the worlds, though the doors between
   them seem to be accessible only to certain people and those who they
   know. Objects can accompany people between the worlds, though they may
   eventually filter themselves back to the world of their origin.

   When they leave the restaurant, Green returns to his own world through
   its door, but Fanny inadvertently follows Lara's aforementioned
   instructions and remains in her own. Green finds that, though he had
   only been in the alternate world for perhaps four days, he has been
   missing from his own for over a month. He is told that he must receive
   a medical checkup before he can return to work, and in doing so it is
   revealed that he has now made eight visits to a psychiatrist for a
   "breakdown". He is hospitalized, but released after admitting that the
   alternate world was most likely a dream. Over the next few years he
   returns to his previous life as a salesman, forgetting about Lara and
   There.

   He is briefly returned to the other world while shopping and is
   reminded of its existence. Shortly after returning to his world he is
   contacted by Lara. They meet at the Italian restaurant and, after some
   coaxing, she reveals more to him about herself and the other world.
   Throughout the story Green had been exposed to hints that his
   girlfriend exists in both worlds. She had appeared as a doll he found
   in the other world, on his television at the first hospital,
   stepdaughter of Klamm (presidential cabinet member searching for
   North), as a famous actress and model There, and was also referred to
   There as 'the goddess'. Now she had taken the alias of receptionist
   Lora Masterman at his psychiatrist's office. She admits to being an
   immortal being from the other world, occasionally joining his world to
   enjoy relationships with men she could sleep with without killing, such
   as Green, Klamm, and a 19th-century sea captain.

   Lara flees Green through the restaurant's door and they reenter the
   alternate world. They reunite at a boxing match where Joe is attempting
   to take the heavyweight title and North is using as a political
   publicity stunt. North interrupts the fight with gunshots, perhaps
   attempting to kill Green, but is subdued by Joe after a brief brawl.
   Green is taken to a hospital for injuries sustained and reunites with
   Fanny. She is instructed to keep watch of him, but he escapes her vise.
   The novel ends with Green exiting the city in a cab, still in the
   alternate world, eager to start a new life devoid of the burdens of his
   old.
