   The Sea of Trolls is set in Anglo-Saxon England, Scandinavia, and the
   mythical realm of Jotunheim.

   Jack Crookleg, the main character of the book, is being trained by a
   famous skald (bard) named Dragon Tongue, when he and his younger
   sister, Lucy, are captured by Viking raiders. The pair are to be sold
   as slaves to "Picts" as soon as they reach land. On board the Viking
   ship Jack meets and ultimately befriends Thorgil, a young would-be
   berserker, and Olaf, the leader of the raiders, along with Boldheart,
   the crow. The two captives are spared because Jack is a bard and
   because Lucy is to be given to the queen, a half-troll named Frith.

   When they arrive at the court nothing goes as planned. Jack is
   sentenced to menial labor and made to clean the barn. There Jack
   encounters the deadly troll-pig, Golden Bristles, who is to be
   sacrificed to the goddess, Freya, by being placed in a wooden cart and
   left to sink in a bog. After singing Olaf One-Brow's praise-song for
   the Northman's homecoming, Jack inadvertently makes Queen Frith lose
   her hair. Queen Frith threatens to sacrifice Lucy (instead of the
   troll-pig) to the goddess Freya, because Jack set Golden Bristles free.
   Golden Bristles tried to kill him. However, Frith allows Jack a chance
   to save Lucy and their freedom if he can make her hair grow back, which
   is much more difficult than she makes it sound. Jack goes with Olaf and
   Thorgil to Jotunheim, land of the Trolls, to seek the mythic Mimir's
   Well, a well with magical water (song mead) which gives the drinker
   knowledge, at the roots of the world tree Yggdrasil. Olaf One-Brow is
   killed by a "trollbear," a gigantic bear native to Jotunheim. Jack and
   Thorgil are captured by a dragon, but Bold Heart tricks the dragon and
   enables Jack and Thorgil to escape. Thorgil slays the baby male dragon
   but gets some blood on her tongue, allowing her to speak with birds. On
   the way Jack also visits the queen of the Jotuns (Trolls), as he needs
   her consent to continue seeking Mimir's Well. He finds the tree
   Yggdrasil and Mimir's Well. Both he and Thorgil drink from the well,
   and Jack saves some for Rune, a skald (bard) who teaches Jack poetry.
   With the knowledge Jack gains from drinking from Mimir's Well, he
   returns to the land of the Northmen to restore Frith's hair.

   Upon return, Jack and Lucy are summoned to the court. Jack explains to
   Queen Frith that she needs to cut off 1/3 of the hair from her troll
   cats but no more to restore her hair. She doesn't listen and cuts all
   of the cats' hair off. As a result, Frith's hair grows everywhere not
   just back on her head. She runs off crazed.

   Later Olaf's oldest son commands the ship and takes Jack and Lucy back
   to their village. Jack finds his mother and learns that Dragon Tongue
   has been crazed ever since Jack and Lucy's kidnapping. He goes to see
   Dragon Tongue with Bold Heart and Dragon Tongue's heart stops beating.
   Jack gives Dragon Tongue the remaining mead from Mimir's Well and he
   comes back to life. Dragon Tongue tells him that he became a crow
   during the voyage.
