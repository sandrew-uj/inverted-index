   House of Leaves begins with a first-person narrative by Johnny Truant,
   a Los Angeles tattoo parlor employee and professed unreliable narrator.
   Truant is searching for a new apartment when his friend Lude tells him
   about the apartment of the recently deceased Zampano, a blind, elderly
   man who lived in Lude's apartment building.

   In Zampano's apartment, Truant discovers a manuscript written by
   Zampano that turns out to be an academic study of a documentary film
   called The Navidson Record directed by an acclaimed photojournalist
   named Will Navidson, though Truant says he can find no evidence that
   the film or its subjects ever existed.

   The rest of the novel incorporates several narratives, including
   Zampano's report on the (possibly fictional) film; Truant's
   autobiographical interjections; a small transcript of part of the film
   from Navidson's brother, Tom; a small transcript of interviews of many
   people regarding The Navidson Record by Navidson's partner, Karen; and
   occasional brief notes by unidentified editors, all woven together by a
   mass of footnotes. There is also another narrator, Truant's mother,
   whose voice is presented through a self-contained set of letters titled
   The Whalestoe Letters. Each narrator's text is printed in a distinct
   font, making it easier for the reader to follow the occasionally
   challenging format of the novel (Truant in Courier New in the
   footnotes, and the main narrative in Times New Roman in the American
   version, the unnamed editors are in Bookman, and the letters from
   Johnny's mother are in Dante).
