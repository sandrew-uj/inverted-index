   The sea has drowned Peri's fisherman father and cast her mother into a
   deep depression. When the only caring figure left in her life, the wise
   woman who taught her magic, also disappears, Peri takes up residence in
   the old woman's cottage and plots revenge. She crafts three hexes to
   curse the sea. She is visited by the king's son Prince Kir, hoping for
   the wise woman's aid in curing his own haunting obsession with the sea.

   When Peri completes her hexes and casts them into the water, she
   includes an offering from the prince. To her surprise, her magic
   succeeds beyond expectations, disrupting the sea queen's magic. A
   chained sea dragon appears, the wandering magician Lyo arrives in the
   village in response, and Kir's sea-dreams grow even more tortured.

   Peri's efforts to help Kir eventually lead to her undertaking a strange
   journey into the depths, uncovering a tragic secret from the king's
   past and the true identity of the sea dragon, and a dawning realization
   of her own power.
