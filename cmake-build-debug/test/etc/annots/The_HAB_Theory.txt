   Boardman stages a clever faux assassination attempt on the President of
   the United States as a ruse to draw attention to his theory. The ruse
   involves a wax .38 caliber bullet propelled only by the
   cartridge-primer at a Presidential rope-line handshake stop. HAB
   completes the ruse and survives his arrest long enough to wake up in a
   hospital and tell his story to a fictional Woodstein which sets the
   action in motion.

   The HAB Theory was Eckert's second novel, but first major fiction
   publication, and had sold 150,000 copies by 1978. The book was made
   available via demand printing in 2004, though this version appears to
   contain a number of typos indicating that it was produced from
   something a bit earlier than the final published draft. The novel's
   romantic sub-plot which today seems quite archaic, was consistent with
   similar storytelling threads of the mid 1970s and was in fact based on
   the author's own divorce.

   The novel borrows heavily from Brown's theory and book, which is that
   approximately every 6,000-7,000 years the Earth's polar ice caps become
   over-burdened with ice, creating such an imbalance in the planet's
   center of gravity, that the Earth's poles and the Earth's equator shift
   positions. The former poles are soon located somewhere between the
   Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, where the weight of the
   polar ice cap leaves a large circular depression and other dramatic
   geological changes occur as the huge quantity of water is released by
   the ice caps melting.

   Called "capsizing" in the novel the "rollover" takes place in a single
   day. Since the velocity of an object at the equator of the Earth is
   approximately 1,000 MPH (1,674 km/h), any such rapid change in
   rotational axis is a massive disturbance to everything from a grain of
   sand to a mountain or an ocean. Humans and their works in such an event
   would be as fallen leaves before a windstorm. The exception being two
   places on earth called "pivot points" which the book says can be
   calculated and further that prior civilizations had calculated them and
   placed long-term-surviving information at such points.

   OOPARTS - "out of place artifacts" real-world scientific anomalies
   (flattened petrified forests in Nova Scotia, huge depressions in Hudson
   Bay and the Sahara Desert, ancient maps showing Antarctica's coastline
   free of ice, woolly mammoths found with un-swallowed food in their
   mouths) are presented as evidence of The HAB Theory's possible
   validity. These OOPARTS are interpreted to suggest that human
   civilizations have existed on earth many times, during intervals like
   the current 6,000 - odd years of recorded history only to disappear
   over and over in yet another "capsizing." Thus human civilizations rise
   from hunter/gatherer/shepherds to builders of cities and flying
   vehicles - only to see that civilization "rebooted" by the planet's
   repeated capsizing.

   Citing OOPARTS in support of an out-of-the-mainstream theory is a
   technique used in other works, including for example the well-known:
   Chariots of the Gods (1968) by Erich von Daeniken in which they are
   interpreted as evidence that extraterrestrial civilizations visited
   pre-modern earth and influenced historic and pre-historic events.

   Imagining then trying to prevent an interesting end of the world
   scenario, is a well established plot-line in storytelling and fiction.
   Each tale will have unique dramatic twists. In The HAB Theory, another
   "capsizing" is overdue, perhaps delayed because the Southern polar ice
   cap is (by sheer coincidence), centered on top of a land continent, but
   nevertheless probable, because the Northern polar icecap is centered
   over the Arctic Ocean.

   In the mid-1970s, global cooling was a more common popular headline
   than global warming, so that fit rather well with this plotline.

   No form of a "capsizing" hypothesis is currently accepted among the
   scientific community.
