   Set in the year 2072, the protagonist--a nameless hacker--is caught
   while attempting to access files concerning Citadel Station, a space
   station owned by the TriOptimum Corporation. The hacker is taken to
   Citadel Station and brought before Edward Diego, a TriOptimum
   executive. Diego offers to drop all charges against the hacker in
   exchange for a confidential hacking of SHODAN, the artificial
   intelligence that controls the station. Diego secretly plans to steal
   an experimental mutagenic virus being tested on Citadel Station, and to
   sell it on the black market as a biological weapon. To entice
   cooperation, Diego promises the hacker a valuable military grade neural
   implant. After hacking SHODAN, removing the AI's ethical
   constraints, and handing control over to Diego, the protagonist
   undergoes surgery to implant the promised neural interface.
   Following the operation, the hacker is put into a six-month healing
   coma. The game begins as the protagonist awakens from his coma, and
   finds that SHODAN has commandeered the station. All robots aboard have
   been reprogrammed for hostility, and the crew have been either mutated,
   transformed into cyborgs, or killed.

   Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum counter-terrorism consultant, contacts
   the player and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being
   powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's plan is to destroy all major
   cities on the planet, in a bid to establish itself as a god.
   Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the
   laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's
   incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With
   information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by
   firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's
   work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with the virus Diego planned to
   steal--the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into
   mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers
   used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been
   transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an
   attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following
   Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by
   destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.

   Soon after, Rebecca contacts the hacker, and says that she has
   convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she
   provides him with details on how to do this. After obtaining the
   necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct
   sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats
   Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN
   prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the
   station, while the bridge--which contains SHODAN--is jettisoned to a
   safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape
   if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the
   transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing
   him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from
   the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a
   technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The
   technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace,
   due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers.
   Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters cyberspace and
   destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at
   TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a
   hacker.
