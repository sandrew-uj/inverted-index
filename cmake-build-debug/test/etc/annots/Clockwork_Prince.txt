   After the events of the previous book, Charlotte Branwell, accompanied
   by her husband Henry, Tessa Gray, Will Herondale, Jem Carstairs, and
   Jessie Lovelace, are called to a Shadowhunters' Council meeting to give
   testimony regarding her failure to capture Axel Mortmain, the leader of
   the Pandemonium Club. Benedict Lightwood, who holds a grudge against
   Granville Fairchild, Charlotte's father, persuades Consul Wayland to
   give Charlotte an ultimatum: unless she is able to capture Mortmain
   within two weeks, she will have to resign as head of the London
   Institute. To further increase the defense of the Institute, Benedict's
   two sons, Gideon and Gabriel, will be assigned as self-defense tutors
   for Tessa, Jessie, and Sophie Collins. Jessie, however, refuses to
   attend the training.

   The Institute begins searching for Mortmain and discovers that his
   adoptive warlock father, John Shade, the creator of the automatons, and
   mother, Anne, were killed by the Clave before the Accords were signed.
   Charlotte suspects that Mortmain began a revenge campaign against the
   Clave after he unsuccessfully filed for Reparations. She sends Tessa,
   Will, and Jem to question Aloysius Starkweather of the York Institute,
   the Shadowhunter who executed Shade. While in York, Will finds out that
   his family, including his sister Cecily are living in Ravenscar Manor,
   owned by Mortmain. An automaton attacks the trio and warns Will to stay
   put unless he wants to see his loved ones killed. During the pursuit,
   an automaton was close enough to kill Tessa before her clockwork angel
   sprung to action.

   Upon returning to London empty-handed, Will confesses to Magnus Bane
   that he ran away from home and emotionally shut himself from everyone
   to escape a curse caused by a demon he unwittingly released from his
   father's Pyxis box, which preys on his loved ones, the first being his
   sister Ella. He pleads to Magnus to summon the demon. As Will's mental
   state deteriorates, he stops returning home and Magnus mails a letter
   for Tessa to search for him. She and Jem find a drugged Will in an
   ifrit den and carry him back home. Tessa comforts a frustrated Jem and
   they share a heated moment where Jem almost confesses his feelings for
   Tessa. They ignore each other painfully. Will explains the next day
   during breakfast that he found information about werewolves eating yin
   fen, the drug Jem depends to survive. Upon getting a negative response
   from Woolsey Scott, head of London's werewolf pack, Charlotte suspects
   that Mortmain hired rogue werewolves to work on his automatons.

   Gideon becomes close with Sophie throughout their training and reveals
   to Tessa the reason why Benedict hates the Fairchild's: his uncle Silas
   committed suicide after his forbidden relationship with his parabatai
   was outed by Granville, leading to his mother Barbara dying in despair.
   Tessa learns from Sophie that Jessie is seeing her brother, Nate, who
   invited her for a ball held in the Lightwood manor. Sophie had snatched
   the invitation and knocked out Jessie, giving Tessa the opportunity to
   attend a ball disguised as her. Accompanied by Will, the two learn that
   Benedict is in a relationship with a demon, and is conspiring with
   Mortmain and Nate to bring down Charlotte. At the Manor, Will and Tessa
   share an urgent and desiring kiss, following which Magnus interrupts
   them and reveals that their drinks were spiked with some warlock
   powder. Will spots Marbas, the demon who had cursed him, and takes off
   after him.

   Charlotte summons the Silent Brothers to detain Jessie and interrogate
   her using the Mortal Sword, after which she is imprisoned in Silent
   City. Tessa and Jem, after making up to each other, reach Jessamine's
   prison and persuade her to betray Nate by arranging for a meeting.
   However, Nate figures out the plan and brings an automaton to even out
   the battle. He tells Tessa that they are actually cousins: his
   biological mother was Aunt Harriet, who passed him up as Elizabeth's
   son to hide the shame that he was conceived out of wedlock. Tessa
   successfully tricks the automaton to turn on Nate and eventually kill
   him, but Will is gravely injured in the process. After Will recovers,
   he goes to Magnus, having broken up with Camille Belcourt and now
   living with Woolsey, to face Marbas. To his shock, Will is told by
   Marbas that there was never any curse and Ella died simply because of
   the wound she sustained while defending Will from him.

   Just two days before the deadline to capture Mortmain, Sophie relays
   Charlotte information she gained from Gideon about the truth of his
   mother and uncle's deaths: Barbara Lightwood had contracted demon pox
   from Benedict -- thanks to his interaction with demons -- and committed
   suicide because of it, while Silas' suicide had nothing to do with the
   Fairchild's at all. Charlotte uses this information to blackmail
   Benedict into dropping his challenge, but Gideon is banished from the
   Lightwood manor, finding refuge in the London Institute. Will confesses
   his love for Tessa, only for her to tell him that she had accepted
   Jem's marriage proposal. The two announce their engagement while at the
   party celebrating Charlotte's acquittal, during which she also reveals
   that she is pregnant with Henry's child. Out of nowhere, Cecily
   Herondale visits the Institute and demands that she be trained as a
   Shadowhunter.
