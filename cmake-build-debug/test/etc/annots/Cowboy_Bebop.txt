   In 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace
   gateway made the Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity has colonized
   most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising
   crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized
   contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to
   as "Cowboys") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a
   reward. The series' protagonists are bounty hunters working from
   the spaceship Bebop. The original crew are Spike Spiegel, an exiled
   former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and Jet Black, a
   former ISSP officer. They are later joined by Faye Valentine, an
   amnesiac con artist; Edward, an eccentric girl skilled in hacking; and
   Ein, a genetically-engineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with human-like
   intelligence. Over the course of the series, the team get involved in
   disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, while often confronting
   faces and events from their past: these include Jet's reasons for
   leaving the ISSP, and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured
   in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life.

   The main story arc focuses on Spike and his deadly rivalry with
   Vicious, an ambitious criminal affiliated with the Red Dragon
   Syndicate. Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends, but when
   Spike began an affair with Vicious's girlfriend Julia and resolved to
   leave the Syndicate with her, Vicious sought to eliminate Spike by
   blackmailing Julia into killing him. Julia goes into hiding to protect
   herself and Spike fakes his death to escape the Syndicate. In the
   present, Julia comes out of hiding and reunites with Spike, intending
   to complete their plan. Vicious, having staged a coup d'etat and taken
   over the Syndicate, sends hitmen after the pair. Julia is killed,
   leaving Spike alone. Spike leaves the Bebop after saying a final
   goodbye to Faye and Jet. Upon infiltrating the syndicate, he finds
   Vicious on the top floor of the building and confronts him after
   dispatching the remaining Red Dragon members. The final battle ends
   with Spike killing Vicious, only to be seriously wounded himself in the
   ensuing confrontation. The series concludes as Spike descends the main
   staircase of the building into the rising sun before eventually falling
   to the ground.
