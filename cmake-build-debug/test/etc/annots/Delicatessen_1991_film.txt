   In a dilapidated apartment building in post-apocalyptic France, food is
   in short supply and grain is used as currency. On the ground floor is a
   butcher's shop, run by the landlord, Clapet, who posts job
   opportunities in the Hard Times paper to lure victims to the building,
   whom he murders and butchers as a cheap source of meat to sell to his
   tenants.

   Following the murder of the last worker, unemployed circus clown
   Louison applies for the vacant position. Louison proves to be a superb
   worker with a spectacular trick knife, and the butcher is reluctant to
   kill him too quickly. During Louison's routine maintenance, he acquires
   a package dropped by a mailman. Louison delivers the package to
   Clapet's daughter, Julie, who says the package contains confections and
   invites him to join her that evening. Louison and Julie's relationship
   blossoms into romance. At the same time, several of the tenants fall
   under Louison's boyish charms, worrying others who are more anxious for
   their own safety should they require meat.

   Clapet tells apartment tenant Marcel Tapioca that his rent is late and
   he must give up his mother-in-law as payment. That evening, Julie begs
   her father to let Louison go, knowing that Clapet is killing tenants
   for meat. She goes to her apartment, unwraps a newspaper in her
   refrigerator and sees an article about the Troglodistes, a group of
   vegetarian rebels who live underground. Julie descends into the sewers
   to make contact with the feared Troglodistes, whom she persuades to
   help rescue Louison.

   After the apparent butchering of Tapioca's mother-in-law, the
   Troglodistes go through the sewer pipes and attempt to capture Louison,
   but end up mistakenly capturing tenant Mademoiselle Plusse instead.
   Meanwhile, as Julie and Louison watch television, Clapet ascends to the
   roof, shaking the television antenna to lure Louison into going up to
   fix it. Attacking Louison with a cleaver, Clapet's attempt to kill him
   is foiled by an unexpected electrical explosion in one of the
   apartments.

   Clapet, along with some sympathetic tenants, storms Louison's room in
   another attempt to murder him. Louison and Julie take refuge in a
   bathroom and flood it, floor to ceiling, until Clapet opens the door,
   releasing the flood and washing the attackers away. Mademoiselle Plusse
   escapes the sewers, finds Louison's boomerang knife, and gives it to
   Clapet. Clapet throws the knife towards Louison, but inadvertently
   kills himself. Louison and Julie play music together on the roof of the
   now peaceful apartment building.
