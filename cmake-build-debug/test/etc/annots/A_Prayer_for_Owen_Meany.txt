   The story is narrated by John Wheelwright, a former citizen of New
   Hampshire who has become a voluntary expatriate from the United States,
   having settled in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and taken on Canadian
   citizenship.

   The story is narrated in two interwoven time frames. The first time
   frame is the perspective of John in the present day (1987). The second
   time frame is John's memories of the past: growing up in New Hampshire
   in the 1950s and 1960s alongside his best friend, Owen Meany.
