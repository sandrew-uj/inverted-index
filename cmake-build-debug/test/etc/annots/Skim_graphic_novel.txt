   Skim is a "not slim" sixteen-year-old Japanese-Canadian who is a
   student at an all-girls Catholic school. She is known as a Goth, and
   practices Wicca. When popular girl Katie Matthews gets dumped by her
   athlete boyfriend, who days later kills himself, the entire school goes
   into mourning overdrive. With the school counsellors breathing down her
   neck and the popular clique (including Katie's best friend Julie
   Peters) forming a new club, Girls Celebrate Life (GCL), in its wake,
   Skim finds herself in the crosshairs, deepening her "depression". And
   if things cannot get more complicated, Skim starts to fall for an
   equally quirky teacher.
