   This book concludes the chronicles of the adventures of such diverse
   characters as Sir Richard Burton, Alice Pleasance Liddell, Aphra Behn
   and Tom Turpin through a bizarre afterlife in which every human ever to
   have lived is simultaneously resurrected along a single river valley
   that stretches over an entire planet.

   Although Farmer's 1980 novel The Magic Labyrinth was originally
   intended to be the last in the series,^[1] Farmer continued it in this
   novel, which picks up with the characters who have just arrived in the
   alien-built tower at the headwaters of the river from which this
   constructed world gets its name; they must decide how to use the
   resurrection machinery they now control, and also solve the mystery of
   the murder of the mysterious stranger.

   It is revealed that the Ethicals have been recording humanity since
   about 97,000 BC.^[2]
