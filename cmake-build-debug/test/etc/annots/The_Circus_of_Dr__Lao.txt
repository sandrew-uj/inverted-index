   The novel is set in the fictional town of Abalone, Arizona. A circus
   owned by a Chinese man named Dr. Lao pulls into town one day, carrying
   legendary creatures from all areas of mythology and legend, among them
   a sea serpent, Apollonius of Tyana (who tells dark, yet always
   truthful, fortunes), a medusa, and a satyr. Through interactions with
   the circus, the locals attain various enigmatic peak experiences
   appropriate to each one's personality.

   The tale ends with the town becoming the site of a ritual to a pagan
   god whimsically given the name Yottle, possibly an allusion to the
   Mesoamerican god Yaotl, whose name means "the enemy". The ritual ends
   when the god himself slays a virgin, her unrequited lover, and his own
   priest. The circus over, the townsfolk scatter to the winds. Apparently
   few of them profit from the surreal experiences.

   The book's appendix is a "catalogue" of all the people, places, items,
   and mythological beings mentioned in the novel, summing up the
   characters pithily and sardonically, revealing the various fates of the
   townsfolk, and listing a number of plot holes and unanswered questions
   not addressed in the book.

   List of Dr. Lao's captured animals:
     * Satyr: 2,300 years old, he was captured in Tu-jeng, China, near the
       Great Wall. He was born of the union of a goatherd and one of his
       goats.
     * Medusa: She is very young and wears very little clothing. She has
       many species of snakes in her hair, of which three are mentioned:
       tantillas, brown with a black ring around their neck; night snakes,
       gray with black spots; and faded snakes (Arizona elegans). She is a
       Sonoran medusa from northern Mexico.
     * Roc chick, "Really not as big as Sinbad thought it was, but plenty
       big enough to do all that he said it did." It hatches from an egg
       that sweats salt water.
     * Hound of the hedges: Created when water touched a dry rice field
       for the first time in many years. His tail is made of ferns; his
       fur is green grass; instead of teeth he has rose thorns; his blood
       and saliva are chlorophyll.
     * Mermaid: She was captured in the Gulf of Pei-Chihli the same day as
       the sea serpent. Her tail is sea-green and sleek scaled; her tail
       fin is as pink as a trout's. Her hair is seaweed green; her human
       half is young and slender with slight breasts.
     * Sphinx: A hermaphroditic, African sphinx. Its head is blunt nosed
       and womanlike; it has breasts like a woman but the voice of a man.
     * Chimera: The chimera is male, unlike the chimera of Greek myth;
       thus, its body is different. Although it has a lion's body and a
       snake's tail, it has eagle's wings and a metal barb at the end of
       its tail with which it can strike like a scorpion. (It seems that
       Finney describes something closer to a manticore.)
     * Sea Serpent: He is almost a hundred feet long and dark gray; his
       tongue is as thick as a man's arm and bright yellow. His eyes are
       bronze with black slits for pupils. His tail is paddle shaped like
       a sea snake's. The Sea Serpent is the only animal that did not
       become tame after being captured. He plans to escape with the
       mermaid and return to the sea.
     * Werewolf: She starts her transformation as a large gray wolf. ("Not
       the American lobo. Probably some species from the Carpathians or
       Urals.") When she transforms, she changes into an old woman, not
       the young lady the men are expecting.
     * Unicorn: Has a metal "horn".
     * Golden Ass: Lucius Apuleius, who turned into an ass "with the help
       of Fotis".
