   The Kane Chronicles is a trilogy of adventure and Egyptian mythological
   fiction books written by American author Rick Riordan. The series is
   set in the same universe as Riordan's other franchises, Camp Half-Blood
   Chronicles and Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard.

   The novels are narrated alternately in first-person by the two
   protagonists, siblings Carter and Sadie Kane. The siblings are powerful
   magicians descended from the two pharaohs Narmer and Ramses the Great.
   They and their friends are forced to contend with Egyptian gods and
   goddesses who still interact with the modern world.
