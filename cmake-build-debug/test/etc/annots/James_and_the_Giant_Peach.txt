   James Henry Trotter is a boy who lives with his parents in a house by
   the sea happily. Unfortunately, when he is four years old, an escaped
   rhinoceros from the zoo eats James's parents and he ends up with his
   two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. Instead of caring for him, they
   treat him badly, feed him improperly and force him to sleep on bare
   floorboards.

   After James had been living with his aunts for three years, he meets a
   mysterious man who gives him a bag of magical crystals, instructing
   James to use them in a potion that would change his life for the
   better. While returning home, James stumbles and spills the bag on the
   ground, losing the crystals as they dig themselves underground. The
   nearby peach tree, in turn, produces a single peach which soon grows to
   the size of a house. Spiker and Sponge build a fence around it and earn
   money by selling viewing tickets to tourists; James is locked in the
   house only able to see the peach through the bars of his bedroom
   window.

   After the tourists have gone, James is assigned to clean the rubbish
   and finds a tunnel in the peach. He enters it and meets Centipede, Miss
   Spider, Old Green Grasshopper, Earthworm, Ladybug, Glowworm, and
   Silkworm who become his friends.

   The next day Centipede cuts the stem of the peach, causing it to roll
   away and crush James' aunts. It reaches the sea and is surrounded by
   ravenous sharks. James uses Miss Spider and Silkworm to make threads,
   while Earthworm is used as bait and draws 501 seagulls^[6] near the
   peach, whereupon the threads are tied on their necks. The peach is
   lifted off the water. High above the clouds, the peach encounters
   Cloud-Men who are portrayed as responsible for weather phenomena like
   hailstorms and rainbows. The peach goes into the clouds and meet cloud
   men demons. Centipede mocks the Cloud-Men, but James is able to avoid
   the altercation by bringing the peach to a lower altitude. James
   realizes that the group has reached New York City.

   The massive peach lands on the spire of the Empire State Building. It
   is mistaken as a bomb at first, resulting in the arrival of police and
   firemen. Calming the crowd, James tells the whole story and becomes
   friends with many children in New York, and they eat the peach and
   James and his friends get their own jobs.
