   Set in an unspecified "near-future" (one of the main characters has
   childhood memories of the Exxon Valdez disaster) in which a radical
   left-wing environmentalist movement has joined forces with the
   religious right through a shared distaste for modern technology. The
   resulting bipartisan conspiracy has gained control of the US government
   and imposed draconian luddite laws which, in attempts to curb global
   warming, have ironically brought about the greatest environmental
   catastrophe in recorded history - an ice age which may eventually
   escalate into a Snowball Earth.

   The exact process is described: clouds are water condensation. This
   cannot occur without cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. The
   emission laws have removed most of this, reducing cloud cover, meaning
   the ground loses heat faster. This in combination with the drop in
   greenhouse gases has resulted in the return and exacerbation of the
   Little Ice Age; now self-perpetuating as glaciers have a much higher
   albedo.

   As a radical totalitarian environmentalist party now controls the US
   government, the scientific explanation is denounced as "propaganda from
   life-hating technophiles", and blame for the ice age is instead solely
   placed on the society surviving in orbit. Science fiction fandom forms
   the core of a pro-technology underground in the United States, working
   in tandem with hacker movements. Other technologists - accused by the
   government of pursuing "materialist science" - were removed from their
   jobs and forced underground, where they were generally unable to
   continue their work. This rabid distaste for technology has resulted in
   the collapse of the economy and lack of education and a complicit media
   has left the majority of the population credulous and easily
   manipulated. The Greens have been in power for most of the lives of the
   characters.

   As glaciers rapidly advance south, Canada and the northern United
   States are all but destroyed. Near the edge of the glaciers, in
   Milwaukee, barbaric feudal systems arise as the federal government and
   markets collapse, leaving violence and disease in their wake. In orbit,
   Mir and Space Station Freedom survive in tandem with a Lunar colony,
   but with no support from Earth. The city of Winnipeg is the last major
   outpost of Canadian civilization, warmed and inhabitable due to immense
   amounts of solar power beamed from the space stations.
