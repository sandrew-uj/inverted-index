   In 1998, Los Angeles has become immensely crime-ridden and decadent,
   ultimately being directly governed and patrolled by the recently
   created United States Police Force. Two years later, on August 23,
   2000, a massive earthquake strikes the city, the San Fernando Valley
   floods, and the Los Angeles area turns into an island from Malibu to
   Anaheim. A theocratic presidential candidate declares Los Angeles to be
   sinful and punished by God.

   When he is elected president for life, the capital is relocated to his
   hometown in Lynchburg, Virginia; meanwhile, he turns the United States
   into a theocratic totalitarian state, and declares that anyone not
   conforming to the new "Moral America" laws that he creates, which ban
   such things as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, recreational drugs, red
   meat, firearms, profanity, atheism, non-Christian religions, and
   extramarital sex will be stripped of their citizenship and deported to
   Los Angeles Island unless they repent and choose death by
   electrocution. A containment wall is built around the island, armed
   guards and watchtowers are posted, and those sent to the island are
   exiled permanently.

   In 2013, Cuervo Jones, a Shining Path Peruvian Revolutionary, seduces
   the president's daughter, Utopia, via a holographic system and
   brainwashes her into stealing her father's remote control to the "Sword
   of Damocles" super weapon, a satellite system capable of rendering all
   electronic devices anywhere on the planet useless, which the president
   intends to use to destroy US enemies' ability to function and
   eventually dominate the world. Utopia escapes Air Force Three and lands
   on Los Angeles Island to join with Cuervo.

   Now controlling the satellites, Cuervo promises to take back the United
   States with an allied invasion force of third world nations that are
   prepared to attack, claiming that if the president tries to stop him,
   he will "pull the plug" on the country and black out the capital, and
   that he also knows the secret world code that can knock out power for
   the entire planet.

   Captured for another series of crimes, Snake Plissken is scheduled for
   exile to the island. Upon arriving for deportation, Snake meets the
   president, who offers him the mission of retrieving the weapon and says
   he will give him a full pardon if he is successful, but indicates he
   does not care about Utopia's return, declaring her a traitor. To ensure
   his compliance, Snake is infected with the man-made Plutoxin 7 virus
   that will kill him within 10 hours; upon completing the mission, he
   will receive the cure.

   Carrying an assault rifle, a personal holographic projector, a
   thermal-camouflage overcoat, and a countdown clock, Snake sneaks into
   the city using a one-man submarine that he loses when the platform it
   lands on crumbles, causing it to sink. While exploring the island,
   Snake meets "Map to the Stars" Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive
   tours. Along the way, Snake is helped by surfing enthusiast Pipeline;
   Taslima, a woman deported for her Muslim faith; and Hershe Las Palmas
   (formerly Carjack Malone), a transgender woman and past criminal
   associate of Snake.

   Snake defeats Cuervo at his staging area of the Happy Kingdom by the
   Sea in Anaheim and takes the remote control. Snake and Eddie leave the
   island with Utopia and some other Cuervo resistors in a helicopter,
   from which Eddie shoots Cuervo, who manages to fire a rocket launcher
   at the chopper before dying. After jumping out of the helicopter and
   landing on an awning, Eddie demands that Snake return, but the chopper
   flies away without him. When the rocket hits the chopper and kills
   everyone inside, including Hershe, Snake and Utopia escape before it
   crashes into a mountain.

   When the president's men reach the crash site, Commander Malloy
   believes that Snake is trying to trick the president by giving him the
   wrong remote and proceeds to find another one on Utopia. After checking
   the disc inside, Commander Malloy announces that they will take the one
   that Utopia unknowingly held. The president then has his men take
   Utopia to the electric chair despite her pleas for forgiveness. Snake
   remains alive even after his countdown clock reaches zero, realizing
   that Plutoxin 7 is only a potent influenza virus whose effects wear off
   within hours of infection. The president tries to use the satellites to
   stop a Cuban invasion force threatening Florida. Activating the remote,
   he hears only Eddie's "Map to the Stars" intro over "I Love L.A."

   The president orders Snake's execution, but because Snake previously
   activated his hologram projector, his hologram self is shot. Snake
   activates the real control device, entering the world code and ending
   all technological activity on the planet, against pleas to stop. At the
   deportation center, Utopia rejoices that Snake shut down the Earth and
   thus saved her. Snake lights a cigarette and blows out the match used
   to light it, uttering, "Welcome to the human race."
