   The title A Hazard of New Fortunes is a reference to William
   Shakespeare's King John. King John portrays the themes of uncertainty,
   change, and violence, all of which are also important to A Hazard of
   New Fortunes.

   The book, which takes place in late 19th century New York City, tells
   the story of Basil March, who finds himself in the middle of a dispute
   between his employer, a self-made millionaire named Dryfoos, and his
   old German teacher, an advocate for workers' rights named Lindau. The
   main character of the novel, Basil March, provides the main perspective
   throughout the novel. He resides in Boston with his wife and children
   until he is persuaded by his entrepreneurial friend Fulkerson to move
   to New York to help him start a new magazine, where the writers benefit
   in a primitive form of profit sharing. After some deliberation, the
   Marches move to New York and begin a rather extensive search for a
   perfect apartment. After many exhausting weeks of searching, Basil
   finally settles on an apartment full of what he and his wife refer to
   as "gimcrackery"--trinkets and decorations that do not appeal to their
   upper-middle-class tastes.

   Work at the new magazine, entitled Every Other Week begins. The
   magazine is bankrolled by a millionaire named Dryfoos, who became
   wealthy after discovering natural gas on his farm in the Midwest, and
   who is now making money on Wall Street. Dryfoos gives his son, Conrad,
   the job of business manager for the magazine in order to try to
   dissuade him from becoming an Episcopalian priest. An artist by the
   name of Angus Beaton, an old friend of Fulkerson's, is chosen to head
   the art department. Beaton chooses Alma Leighton, for whom he has
   feelings, to illustrate the cover of the first issue. Berthold Lindau,
   an old friend of Basil March's (and his former German teacher) and a
   veteran of the American Civil War, becomes the translator. Lindau knows
   many languages, so he selects and translates Russian, French, and
   German stories to publish in the magazine. Lindau lost his hand in a
   Civil War battle, fighting for the North because he was a strong
   abolitionist and an idealistic American immigrant.

   Colonel Woodburn, a wealthy Southerner, and his daughter move to New
   York and become involved with the newspaper when their social circle
   connects with the magazine's through Alma Leighton; they board with
   Alma Leighton and her mother. Fulkerson decides that he would like to
   publish some of Colonel Woodburn's pro-slavery writings in Every Other
   Week, because he believes it would sell more copies of the new
   magazine. At a dinner banquet, the political views of Dryfoos the
   capitalist, Lindau the socialist, and Colonel Woodburn the pro-slavery
   advocate clash. Lindau fiercely criticizes Dryfoos, expressing his
   harshest feelings in German to March, because he does not think anyone
   else at the table speaks German. Later we learn that Dryfoos (of
   Pennsylvania-Dutch background) speaks German, and he was insulted by
   Lindau's comments.

   In the end of the book, the New York City streetcar drivers strike. The
   strike, similar to the Haymarket affair, turns into a riot. Conrad
   Dryfoos, already a humanitarian helping the poor and working class, is
   charmed by the lovely Margaret Vance, who shares his values of charity.
   She encourages Conrad to try to end the strike by telling all sides to
   desist. While attempting to stop a policeman from beating the aged and
   disabled Lindau, Conrad is fatally shot. March emerges from a streetcar
   to see the fallen men lying on the street next to each other. Dryfoos
   grieves the loss of his son. After further amputation of his already
   disabled arm, Lindau dies with Margaret Vance at his side. Dryfoos
   sells the magazine to Fulkerson and March for an extremely low price
   and takes his remaining family to Europe. Fulkerson moves into the
   apartment above the magazine with his new wife, Colonel Woodburn's
   daughter. The Marches pass Margaret Vance on the street; she has become
   an Episcopalian nun.
