   In a decadent and caste-based future, humanity is divided into guilds,
   each having a specific job to do. The members of some guilds appear to
   have undergone genetic engineering, for instance, the Fliers' ability
   to fly and the Watchers' ability to use their mental capabilities to
   watch distant stars.

   The main character in the novella is a Watcher whose mission is to
   watch the skies with some sophisticated equipment and to inform the
   Defenders in the event of an alien invasion. Along with a young Flier
   girl and a Changeling (who belongs to no guild), he visits the old city
   of Roum (suspected previously to be called Rome), and becomes entangled
   in events including the possibility of invasion.

   Apart from Roum, a number of other great cities are mentioned including
   Jorslem (Jerusalem), Stambool (Istanbul), Marsay (Marseilles), Donsk
   (Gdansk), Nayrub (Nairobi), (Dijon), Palerm (Palermo) and Perris
   (Paris), but their greatness is relative, as they only have a few
   thousand inhabitants.
