   The Gzilt, a civilisation that almost joined the Culture 10,000 years
   before the novel, have decided to Sublime, leaving behind "the Real" to
   take up residence in higher dimensions. The Zihdren-Remnant, what is
   left of an older species that Sublimed before the Culture was formed,
   send an envoy to confess a long-kept secret before the Gzilt depart but
   a Gzilt warship intercepts and destroys their ship several weeks before
   the Sublimation is due to take place in order to preserve that secret.

   The Culture sends ships both to wish the Gzilt well, as they have
   always been on good terms with the Gzilt, and to keep an eye on the
   younger species arriving to scavenge the technology and infrastructure
   the Gzilt leave behind. Two of these, the Liseiden (an eel-like
   species) and the Ronte (a hive insect-like species) are jockeying in
   negotiations with the Gzilt for official permission and preferred
   status.

   Vyr Cossont is introduced as a former Lieutenant-Commander (reserve) of
   the Gzilt, who has set herself a life-task of playing T. C. Vilabier's
   26th String-Specific Sonata For An Instrument Yet To Be Invented, the
   eponymous Hydrogen Sonata, on the instrument subsequently invented for
   its performance: the Antagonistic Undecagonstring, or elevenstring. In
   order to do so, she has had to grow two additional arms. Both the
   instrument and the work are presented as unusually challenging.

   Spyware aboard the Gzilt warship has transmitted the secret to the 14th
   Regiment, traditional opponents of the current power structure and
   erstwhile dissenters in the decision to Sublime; they recruit Cossont,
   who once knew Ngaroe QiRia, a Culture citizen who can verify the truth
   of the Zihdren secret. Alerted to their knowledge and doing all he can
   to ensure a smooth Sublimation, Septame Banstegeyn orders their
   destruction. Cossont barely escapes, and is eventually picked up by the
   Mistake Not..., a Culture ship of non-standard class. They begin to
   head towards the storage facility where Cossont left the mind state
   QiRia had given her, but are interrupted by intelligence that he had
   stopped at Xown, where Cossont had been living, some five years
   earlier. Despite confirmation that he had indeed stopped there, they
   are unable to locate the information they need.

   Meanwhile, a group of Minds dealing with the issue wake Scoaliera
   Tefwe, a former lover of QiRia who has been Stored for many centuries.
   She agrees to try and track him down, and her mind state is sent to
   inhabit a pair of new bodies, stopping for information from an old
   drone. When she finds him, he reveals he has had the memories removed.

   Cossont and the Mistake Not... successfully retrieve QiRia's
   mind-state, but only after being attacked in the storage facility on
   Banstegeyn's orders. Unfortunately, the memories have also been wiped
   from the mind state, and they have to return to Xown when they realise
   where they have been hidden. Cossont manages to retrieve the memories
   despite heavy attack and the loss of the ship's avatar.

   The Gzilt Book of Truth is revealed to have been a sociological
   experiment by a fringe Zihdren scientist that was subsequently
   forgotten. This had been disclosed to QiRia and other members of the
   prospective Culture. After finding this out and deciding it would not
   affect the ability of the Gzilt to join the Culture being formed, their
   minds had been wiped of these memories. However, experimental memory
   storage augmentation in QiRia prevented the memories from being
   properly removed.

   The other Minds in the group decide to keep the secret, and some 99.9%
   of the Gzilt Sublime. Cossont is one of the few that does not. She
   leaves behind her elevenstring instrument, and considers rejoining the
   Mistake Not... to visit QiRia at the planet where he is on retreat, and
   returning his memories.
