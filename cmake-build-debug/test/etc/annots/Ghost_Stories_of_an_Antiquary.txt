   After Jonathan Miller adapted "Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My
   Lad" for Omnibus in 1968, several stories from the collection were
   adapted as the BBC's yearly Ghost Story for Christmas strand, including
   "Lost Hearts", "The Treasure of Abbot Thomas", "The Ash-tree", and
   "Number 13". "Whistle and I'll Come to You" was also heavily adapted by
   Neil Cross for broadcast on Christmas Eve 2010.
