   A human narrator from England is transported out of his body via
   unexplained means. He realizes he is able to explore space and other
   planets. After exploring a civilization on another planet in our galaxy
   at a level of development similar to our own that existed millions of
   years ago thousands of light years from Earth (the "Other Earth") in
   some detail, his mind merges with that of one of its inhabitants, and
   as they travel together, they are joined by still more minds or
   group-minds. This snowballing process is paralleled by the expansion of
   the book's scale, describing more and more planets in less and less
   detail.

   The disembodied travelers encounter many ideas that are interesting
   from both science-fictional and philosophical points of view. These
   include many imaginative descriptions of species, civilizations and
   methods of warfare, descriptions of the multiverse, and the idea that
   the stars and pre-galactic nebulae are intelligent beings, operating on
   vast time scales. A key idea is the formation of collective minds from
   many telepathically linked individuals, on the level of planets,
   galaxies, and eventually the cosmos itself.

   A symbiotic species, each individual composed of two species, both
   non-humanoid, is discussed in detail. Normally detached from the
   galaxy's turmoil, they intervene in a deus ex machina to end the threat
   of a civilization dedicated to the idea of total insanity trying to
   force its mentality onto one stellar civilization after another.

   The climax of the book is the "supreme moment of the cosmos", when the
   cosmic mind (which includes the narrator) attains momentary contact
   with the titular "Star Maker". The Star Maker is the creator of the
   universe, but stands in the same relation to it as an artist to his
   work, and calmly assesses its quality without any feeling for the
   suffering of its inhabitants. This element makes the novel one of
   Stapledon's efforts to write "an essay in myth making".

   After meeting the Star Maker, the traveler is given a "fantastic myth
   or dream," in which he observes the Star Maker at work. He discovers
   that his own cosmos is only one of a vast number, and by no means the
   most significant. He sees the Star Maker's early work, and he learns
   that the Star Maker was surprised and intensely interested when some of
   his early "toy" universes -- for example a universe composed entirely
   of music with no spatial dimensions -- displayed "modes of behavior
   that were not in accord with the canon which he had ordained for them."
   He sees the Star Maker experimenting with more elaborate universes,
   which include the traveler's own universe, and a triune universe which
   closely resembles "Christian orthodoxy" (the three universes
   respectively being hell, heaven, and reality with presence of a
   savior). The Star Maker goes on to create "mature" universes of
   extraordinary complexity, culminating in an "ultimate cosmos," through
   which the Star Maker fulfills his own eternal destiny as "the ground
   and crown of all things." Finally, the traveler returns to Earth at the
   place and time he left, to resume his life there.
