   The novel is set in a parallel world in which the existence of psychic
   powers has permitted the development of witchcraft into a science; in
   contrast, the physical sciences have languished, resulting in a modern
   culture reminiscent of our eighteenth century. Witchcraft is hereditary
   but the ability to use it can be held by only one member of a family
   line at a time, being passed from mother to daughter at the daughter's
   loss of virginity. The daughter's lover then gains possession of her
   magical talisman, a jewel known as a "blue star", which enables him to
   read the mind of anyone he looks in the eye. The catch is that he
   retains access to this power only so long as he keeps faith with his
   witch lover.

   The empire in which the action is set is comparable to the Austrian one
   in our own history. The government bans witchcraft, which merely serves
   to drive its practitioners underground, where they can fall prey to the
   use and abuse of unscrupulous powerful or ambitious individuals. The
   protagonists are Lalette Asterhax, a hereditary witch, and Rodvard
   Bergelin, an ordinary government clerk who has been recruited into the
   radical conspiracy of the Sons of the New Day. Rodvard, though
   attracted to the daughter of a baron, is commanded by his superiors to
   seduce Lalette instead to gain the use of her blue star in the
   furtherance of their revolutionary aims. The witch is no more truly
   enamored of him than he is of her, but both fall in with the scheme for
   their own reasons, unaware of how much they are simply pawns in the
   larger scheme of things.

   Everything soon goes bad, and the couple is forced to flee the empire.
   Various adventures and complications ensue as they stray into one cause
   or acquaintance after another, gradually growing beyond their shallow,
   selfish roots into a greater understanding.
