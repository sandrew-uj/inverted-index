   Illustration for "The Monkey's Paw" by Maurice Greiffenhagen, from
   Jacobs' short story collection The Lady of the Barge (1902)

   The short story involves Mr. and Mrs. White and their adult son,
   Herbert. Sergeant-Major Morris, a friend who served with the British
   Army in India, comes by for dinner and introduces them to a mummified
   monkey's paw. An old fakir placed a spell on the paw, so that it would
   grant three wishes but only with hellish consequences as punishment for
   tampering with fate. Morris, having had a horrible experience using the
   paw, throws it into the fire. Mr. White, not believing Morris,
   retrieves it. Before leaving, Morris warns Mr. White of what might
   happen should he use the paw.

   Mr. White hesitates at first, believing that he already has everything
   he wants. At Herbert's suggestion, Mr. White flippantly wishes for
   -L-200, which will enable him to make the final mortgage payment for
   his house. When he makes his wish, Mr. White suddenly drops the paw in
   surprise, claiming that it moved and twisted like a snake. The next
   day, Herbert leaves for work at a local factory. That night, an
   employee arrives at the Whites' home, telling them that Herbert had
   been killed in a terrible machine accident that mutilated his body. The
   company denies any responsibility for the incident, but makes a
   goodwill payment to the family of the deceased. The payment is -L-200,
   the amount Mr. White had wished for.

   A week after the funeral, Mrs. White, mad with grief, insists that her
   husband use the paw to wish Herbert back to life. Reluctantly, he does
   so, despite great unease at the thought of summoning his son's
   mutilated and decomposing body. An hour or so later--the cemetery being
   two miles away--there is a knock at the door. As Mrs. White fumbles at
   the locks in a desperate attempt to open the door, Mr. White becomes
   terrified and fears "the thing outside" is not the son he loved. He
   makes his third wish. The knocking stops suddenly and Mrs. White opens
   the door to find no one is there.
