   While on a sea voyage, a ship named Naglfar founders. One anhedonic
   passenger, A. Clarence Shandon (M.B.A., Wisconsin), is washed ashore in
   a fictional land known as "The Commonwealth of Letters". He is
   befriended by Golias, who nicknames him "Silverlock" and who becomes
   his guide. Silverlock and Golias encounter figures from history,
   literature and mythology.
