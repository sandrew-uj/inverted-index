   The novel begins when Janet Evason suddenly arrives in Joanna's world.
   Janet is from Whileaway, a futuristic world where a plague killed all
   of the men over 800 years ago, and Jeannine lives in a world that never
   experienced the end of the Great Depression. Janet finds Jeannine at a
   Chinese New Year festival and takes her to Joanna's world. Joanna comes
   from a world that is beginning its feminist movement.

   Acting as a guide, Joanna takes Janet to a party in her world to show
   her how women and men interact with each other. Janet quickly finds
   herself the object of a man's attention, and after he harasses her,
   Janet knocks the man down and mocks him. Because Joanna's world
   believes that women are inferior to men, everyone is shocked. Janet
   expresses her desire to experience living with a typical family so
   Joanna takes Janet to the Wildings' household. Janet meets their
   daughter Laura Rose who instantly admires Janet's confidence and
   independence as a woman. Laura realizes that she is attracted to Janet
   and begins to pursue a sexual relationship with her. This is
   transgressive for both of them, as Whileaway's taboo against
   cross-generational relationships (having a relationship with someone
   old enough to be your parent or child) is as strong as the taboo
   against same-sex relationships on Laura's world.

   The novel then follows Jeannine and Joanna as they accompany Janet back
   to Whileaway. They meet Vittoria, Janet's wife, and stay at their home.
   Joanna finds herself under scrutiny when Vittoria uses a story about a
   bear trapped between two worlds as a metaphor for her life. Jeannine
   returns to her world with Joanna, and they both go to vacation at her
   brother's house. Jeannine's mother pesters her about her love life and
   whether she is going to get married soon. Jeannine goes on a few dates
   with some men but still finds herself dissatisfied. Jeannine begins to
   doubt her sense of reality, but soon decides that she wants to
   assimilate into her role as a woman. She calls Cal and agrees to marry
   him.

   Joanna, Jeannine, Janet, and Laura are lounging in Laura's house. Laura
   tries to glorify Janet's status in Whileaway, but Janet explains that
   her world does not value her particularly, but chose her as
   inter-dimensional explorer because she was more expendable than others
   ("I am stupid," she explains). At 3 a.m., Joanna comes down, unable to
   sleep, and finds Jeannine and Janet awake as well. Suddenly they are no
   longer at Laura's house but in another world.

   Joanna, Jeannine, and Janet have arrived in Jael's world which is
   experiencing a 40-year-old war between male and female societies. Jael
   explains that she works for the Bureau of Comparative Ethnology, an
   organization that concentrates on people's various counterparts in
   different parallel worlds. She reveals that she is the one who brought
   all of them together because they are essentially "four versions of the
   same woman" (p. 162). Jael takes all of them with her into enemy
   territory because she appears to be negotiating a deal with one of the
   male leaders. At first, the male leader appears to be promoting
   equality, but Jael quickly realizes that he still believes in the
   inferiority of women. Jael reveals herself as a ruthless assassin,
   kills the man, and shuttles all of the women back to her house. Jael
   finally tells the other women why she has assembled all of them. She
   wants to create bases in the other women's worlds without the male
   society knowing and eventually empower women to overthrow oppressive
   men and their gender roles for women.

   In the end, Jeannine and Joanna agree to help Jael and assimilate the
   women soldiers into their worlds, but Janet refuses, given the overall
   pacifism of Whileaway. Jeannine and Joanna appear to have become
   stronger individuals and are excited to rise up against their gender
   roles. Janet is not moved by Jael's intentions so Jael suggests Janet
   that the reason for the absence of men on Whileaway is not because of a
   plague but because the women won the war and killed all of the men in
   its timeline's past. Janet refuses to believe Jael, and the other women
   are annoyed at Janet's resistance. The novel ends with the women
   separating and returning to their worlds, each with a new perspective
   on her life, her world, and her identity as a woman.
