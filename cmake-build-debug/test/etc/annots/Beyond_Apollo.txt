   The novel's protagonist is Harry M. Evans, the lone survivor of the
   disastrous first manned expedition to the planet Venus. Evans provides
   details of the doomed expedition as a novel in progress, and he proves
   to be a remarkably unreliable narrator,^[1] constantly changing the
   particulars of his story as it progresses. It quickly becomes apparent
   to the reader that he may be completely insane, as a feeling of deep
   (and comical) paranoia underlies Evans's descriptions of the absurd
   conversations that ensue with the Venusian inhabitants. There is some
   indication that Evans could very well have murdered his fellow
   crewmember. The novel ends with a publishing house offering to purchase
   the rights to Evans's outlandish tale.
