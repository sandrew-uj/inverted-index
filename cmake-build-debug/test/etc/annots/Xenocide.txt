   On Lusitania, Ender finds a world where humans and pequeninos and the
   Hive Queen could all live together. However, Lusitania also harbors the
   descolada, a virus that kills all humans it infects, but which the
   pequeninos require in order to become adults. The Starways Congress so
   fears the effects of the descolada, should it escape from Lusitania,
   that they have ordered the destruction of the entire planet, and all
   who live there. With the Fleet on its way, a second xenocide seems
   inevitable.^[2]
