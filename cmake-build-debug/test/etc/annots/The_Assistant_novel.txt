   Morris Bober, the 60-year-old proprietor of an old-fashioned grocery
   store, faces destitution as his customers abandon him in favor of more
   modernized shops. The situation is aggravated late one night when he's
   held up at gunpoint in his deserted store by a pair of masked thugs.
   The gunman beats him, leaving Bober with a debilitating head injury.
   Just at this time, Frank Alpine makes his appearance: a 25-year-old
   vagrant from the West Coast, raised in an orphanage after his father
   abandoned him. Leaving an abusive foster home to live as a drifter, he
   makes his way East in hopes of finding opportunities to turn his life
   around. (Later he berates himself for having had many opportunities but
   inevitably doing something to botch them.)

   Frank begins to haunt Morris' store and offers to work without pay as
   his assistant, claiming that this will give him experience he can use
   in a future job search. The grocer, weakened by the assault and trying
   to recuperate without benefit of medical care, accepts and arranges for
   him to have room and board with the upstairs tenants, a young
   Italian-American couple, and provides him some pocket money. Only at
   this point is it revealed to the reader that Frank was the accomplice
   to the gunman in the holdup.

   Frank works industriously to improve the store's upkeep, and his
   attentive service wins customers. The resulting increased income is
   being supplemented by Frank's surreptitiously returning, in discreet
   amounts, his share of the holdup take. Simultaneously, however, he
   begins pilfering from the till. He justifies this to himself by
   claiming it as recompense for his contribution to the store's improved
   situation, and keeps an account of his petty theft with the intention
   of eventually returning it all. Morris and his wife Ida, the latter
   particularly uncomfortable with the gentile's presence, attribute the
   improvement to the customers' "preferring one of their own," and Morris
   insists on offering Frank more money. During lulls in the work day the
   men's conversations touch upon philosophical and personal matters, and
   Frank privately struggles with his own ethical quandary.

   While Morris is notably tolerant of others, Ida is worried by the young
   Italyener's proximity to the couple's 23-year-old daughter, Helen,
   single and living at home. Helen is courted by the sons of the only
   other two Jews in the neighborhood, both young men with good financial
   prospects, but her dreams of a better life include true love. She also
   aspires to higher education, but has set aside her own plans in order
   to take a job as a secretary, as her wages are needed to supplement the
   family's meager income from the store.

   Helen and Frank begin to notice each other, and a romance develops
   between them. They share an interest in books and discuss their dreams
   for the future. Their clandestine meetings grow in physical intimacy,
   yet at Helen's request stop short of intercourse. Just when she
   realizes she loves Frank and is committed to their relationship, Morris
   catches his assistant in the act of stealing. He dismisses Frank on the
   spot, despite the latter's confession and revelation that he "was
   paying it back." (His confession to Morris of his role in the holdup
   will follow.) When Frank arrives late to a rendezvous in the park
   initiated by Helen, he finds her being raped and rescues her. Helen is
   overcome by relief and clings to Frank, declaring her love for him. In
   his fear that he's bound to lose her when she learns of his thieving
   and dismissal, Frank forces himself upon her, despite her repeated
   protest. Disgusted with herself for ever having trusted him despite her
   initial misgivings, Helen curses Frank and refuses to see him again.
   Frank obsessively berates himself with remorse and contemplates ways to
   make things up to her. He apologizes to Helen profusely at every
   opportunity, smothering her with his need for redemption.

   Meanwhile, the prospects for the store have remained bleak due to
   several turns of events, and Morris considers desperate measures. When
   he is hospitalized after inhaling gas from a radiator he failed to
   light (claiming afterwards that this was not deliberate), Frank comes
   back to run the store over Ida's protests.

   Frank resolves to be a good person, stop stealing and somehow win back
   Helen's love. He takes on a second job at a diner. But, when Morris
   decides to leave his sick bed, he throws Frank out for good, or so he
   thinks.

   Morris grows anxious about his life--his wife is miserable, his
   daughter on her way to spinsterhood and his poor business no more than
   a prison. Morris turns down an arsonist's offer to burn his home and
   store for the insurance money, but then builds a fire himself. As the
   flames catch on his apron, Morris is saved by Frank. After being saved,
   Morris sends Frank away again.

   Then, through tragedy, things begin to look up for the Bobers. A
   competing grocer on the block falls on hard times, and Bober's store
   benefits. Then, one night, Ward Minogue breaks into the liquor store
   owned by Bober's rival, Karp. Minogue smashes liquor bottles, then he
   lights a cigarette. A tossed match starts a fire that burns the store
   and the apartment upstairs to the ground. Minogue dies attempting to
   escape the fire.

   Morris is ashamed that he wished for his rival's comeuppance. Even so,
   Karp, knowing that he will lose his business while it is being rebuilt,
   offers to buy out the Bobers. For a few brief days, they are happy. It
   is the last day of March and thick snow is falling. Morris, in a burst
   of energy, goes out to shovel the sidewalk, despite Ida's many
   objections. Still weak from the gas incident, he dies three days later
   of double pneumonia.

   Morris is remembered at his simple service as an honest man and a good
   Jew. But Frank and Helen are alienated. Frank returns to run the store
   while Helen and Ida mourn privately. Money from a second job allows
   Frank to pay rent to Ida but ruins his health.

   Frank then settles on a plan to clear his debt with Helen. He will give
   over all his earnings so that Helen can go to college. After several
   painful and awkward confrontations, Helen reinterprets the night that
   Frank sexually assaulted her, concluding that she would have given
   herself to Frank that night had not Ward Minogue attacked her. She
   softens towards Frank, forgiving him for raping her.

   As the book closes, Frank is working in the store. He studies Judaism.
   He gets a circumcision. And, after Passover, becomes a Jew.
