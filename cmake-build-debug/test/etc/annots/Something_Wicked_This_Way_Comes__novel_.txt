   The novel opens on an overcast October 23. Two friends - William "Will"
   Halloway and Jim Nightshade - both on the verge of their fourteenth
   birthdays, encounter a strange lightning rod salesman, Tom Fury. He
   announces that a storm is coming their way. The salesman gives Jim a
   lightning rod because he tells the boys that one of their houses is in
   danger. Throughout the night, Will and Jim meet up with townsfolk who
   also sense something in the air. Among the townspeople is Will's
   54-year-old father, Charles Halloway, who works in the local library.
   Both Mr. Halloway and the boys learn about the carnival that is to
   start the next day. Jim and Will are excited that a carnival has come
   so late in the year, but Charles Halloway has a bad feeling about it.

   The boys run out to watch the carnival arrive at three in the morning.
   As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as
   the carnival. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and
   encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after
   visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and
   Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's
   abandoned bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens
   after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a
   carousel, which has an out-of-order sign. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs
   Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the
   merry-go-round is broken. Mr. Dark arrives and tells him to put them
   down. He pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees.
   The boys run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger
   riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and
   when he steps off, to their shock, he is twelve years old.

   They follow young Mr. Cooger to Miss Foley's house, where he pretends
   to be the nephew she was expecting. Jim tries to talk with him, because
   he wants to ride the carousel, but Will stops him. Jim takes off in the
   direction of the carnival. When Will catches up, Mr. Cooger is riding
   the carousel growing older, and Jim is about to join him. Will knocks
   the switch on the carousel and it flies out of control, spinning
   rapidly forward. Mr. Cooger ages over 100 years before it stops, and
   Jim and Will take off. They return with the police, but Mr. Cooger is
   nowhere to be found. Inside the tents they find him all set up as a new
   act, "Mr. Electrico", a man they run electricity through. Mr. Dark
   tells the boys to come back to the carnival the next day. Will tries to
   keep his father out of the situation, promising him that he will tell
   all soon. That night, the Dust Witch floats by in her balloon to find
   Jim and Will. Will lures her to an abandoned house and destroys her
   balloon with a bow and arrow. They later both dream of a bizarre
   funeral for the balloon, featuring a giant, misshapen coffin.

   The next day the boys find a girl crying on the curb and realize she is
   the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They
   assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a
   parade. The carnival is out searching the streets for the two of them.
   The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain
   in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr.
   Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Halloway pretends not to know
   the two boys, whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the
   Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows cigar smoke
   at her, choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks
   Charles Halloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the
   town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library
   where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The
   carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves in the midst of a giant
   storm. Mr. Dark appears, and the boys hide in the book stacks. He
   discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Halloway
   attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to
   mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Halloway's heart. Just before
   he is about to die, Charles looks at the Witch and begins to laugh
   hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He
   then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.

   At the carnival, Charles triumphs over Mr. Dark, finds his son in the
   mirror maze, kills the Witch with a smile on a bullet, and destroys all
   the mirrors by using of laughter and cheer. Then he and Will search for
   Jim. Mr. Cooger turns to dust and blows away before he can be saved by
   the carousel. Jim runs to the merry-go-round and rides it forward. Will
   tries to stop him and grabs onto his leg. They both end up going for a
   ride before Will jumps off and rips Jim away from the machine. Jim
   falls into a stupor, close to death. A child comes begging them to help
   him, but Mr. Halloway recognizes the boy as Mr. Dark. He holds the boy
   tight and kills him with affection, because Mr. Dark cannot survive in
   such close contact with someone so happy. The carnival falls apart as
   Will tries to revive Jim. They save Jim by singing and dancing and
   laughing, their happiness bringing him back from the edge of death.
