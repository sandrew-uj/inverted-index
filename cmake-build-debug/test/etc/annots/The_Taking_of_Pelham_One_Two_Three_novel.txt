   A normal day on the subway is disrupted by the hijacking of a 6 train,
   designated Pelham One Two Three to indicate its point and time of
   origin. Four men armed with submachine guns detach the lead car and
   drive it into a tunnel with its 17 passengers as hostages. The
   hijackers are led by Ryder, a former mercenary, and consist of
   disgruntled former motorman Longman, violent ex-Mafia thug Joey
   Welcome, and powerful, laconic brute Steever. The gang threaten to
   execute one hostage per minute unless the city delivers to them a one
   million dollar ransom within one hour. One of the hostages is an armed
   undercover police officer, who considers the odds too overwhelming to
   attempt any confrontation and remains seated and quiet.

   While the city authorities weigh it up and agree to pay, the transit
   police try to figure out the hijackers' plan, particularly their escape
   from a tunnel while completely surrounded. They do not suspect that the
   hijackers have a mechanism, "The Gimmick", for defeating the train's
   dead-man's switch, which prevents the train from running without a
   driver's hand pressing down on it. The hijackers intend to let the
   train and its hostages speed along the track by itself, chased by the
   police above surface, while they get away. They will discard their
   weapons and escape through an emergency exit, disappearing into the
   busy flow of New York pedestrians.

   The ransom is delivered to the hijackers, who then demand that the
   track ahead is cleared all the way to South Ferry. They move the train
   a short distance down the tunnel, fit The Gimmick, get off the train,
   and engage The Gimmick to hold down the dead-man's switch. Once the
   train is underway the gang makes their way to an emergency exit and the
   undercover police officer jumps off into the tunnel.

   At the emergency exit, Welcome refuses to leave his submachine gun
   behind and argues with Ryder. Ryder fatally shoots him, but the delay
   allows the undercover cop to shoot Steever from the darkness of the
   tunnel. Longman escapes while Ryder fires back and wounds the cop. As
   Ryder goes to finish him off with a head shot, he is himself shot dead
   by DCI Daniels of the Special Operations Division. Later, the transit
   police go through their records of dismissed motormen and track down
   and arrest Longman.
