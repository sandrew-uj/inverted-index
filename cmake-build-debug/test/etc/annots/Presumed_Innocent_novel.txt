   The novel begins with the discovery of Carolyn Polhemus's body in her
   apartment. She is the victim of what appears to be a sexual bondage
   encounter gone wrong, killed by a single blow to the skull with an
   unknown object while tied up. Rozat "Rusty" Sabich, a Kindle County
   prosecutor and co-worker of Carolyn, is assigned her case by his boss,
   district attorney Raymond Horgan. Horgan is currently losing his
   re-election campaign against Nico Della Guardia, an old protege turned
   rival, and informs Rusty that his continued employment is entwined with
   Horgan's victory, which he believes hinges on finding and convicting
   Carolyn's killer. This is further complicated by the fact that, unknown
   to everyone else, Rusty had a brief affair with Carolyn that ended
   months before her murder. She dumped him when he showed little interest
   in taking Horgan's job for himself, causing him to realize her
   ambitious, conniving nature.

   Despite his obvious conflict of interest, Rusty takes charge of the
   investigation, but makes clumsy attempts to divert its areas of inquiry
   away from the DA's office, and by extension himself. He's assisted by
   his friend Det. Dan "Lip" Lipranzer, whom Rusty replaces the originally
   assigned officer with. During the investigation, Rusty learns Horgan
   also had a brief relationship with Carolyn. The only person who knows
   of Rusty's own affair is his wife, Barbara, and the subsequent strain
   on their marriage led him to seek psychiatric help. Throughout the
   novel he discusses various relationships in his life: with his late
   father, a closed-off, angry man; with Della Guardia, a friendship that
   soured due to uncontrollable circumstances; with Barbara, a volatile
   mixture of devotion and disdain; and of course with Carolyn, which he
   has struggled to define since its end.

   Horgan loses the election and, within days of Della Guardia taking
   office, he charges Rusty with Carolyn's murder, encouraged by his
   overzealous deputy, Tommy Molto. Rusty hires Alejandro "Sandy" Stern,
   an Argentinean defense lawyer who has been a frequent opponent over the
   years, to represent him. The judge assigned to the case is Larren
   Lyttle, an old friend and colleague of Horgan's who has an acrimonious
   history with Molto.

   The prosecution's case against Rusty, which failed to definitively
   prove his affair and thus lacks motive, relies on circumstantial
   evidence: a bar glass with his fingerprints, sperm that might be his in
   Carolyn's vagina, carpet fabric that might be from his home, and
   records of a call from his home to Carolyn's apartment on the night of
   the murder, along with his attempts to seemingly impede the
   investigation. However, just as the trial begins the prosecution is
   forced to admit the glass is missing; Larren refuses to delay until it
   is located. As the trial ensues, Rusty learns through his and
   Lipranzer's independent investigations that Lyttle also had an affair
   with Polhemus, and that she acted as a courier in a bribery scheme
   where Lyttle was paid by defendants to let them off in court. Stern,
   while subtly threatening Lyttle with his own knowledge of this, is able
   to discredit a forensic expert's testimony regarding the sperm sample
   and inconclusive witness statements, persuasively arguing that Molto,
   who was aware of the bribery scheme but not involved, has fabricated
   evidence to frame Rusty out of misguided loyalty to Carolyn. Without
   proof of the affair or that Rusty had been in Carolyn's apartment the
   night of the murder, Larren sees no reason to continue and dismisses
   the case.

   Time passes and Rusty's relationship with Barbara worsens, after the
   trial had seemingly repaired it. When she announces her intention to
   leave him and take their son, Rusty explains his deduction that she
   killed Carolyn, as revenge on the woman who nearly destroyed her
   family; she admits that he is correct. During a visit to Rusty's house,
   Lipranzer reveals that he has the missing bar glass, which came about
   due to careless mismanagement by Molto and Lip's own disinterest in
   aiding the prosecution. Rusty talks Lip through how and why Barbara
   committed the murder while thoroughly cleaning the glass, destroying
   the only real evidence against him. They speculate whether Barbara left
   the glass at the scene because she wanted Rusty to know what she had
   done, or because she wanted him to be convicted. Rusty ultimately
   decides it doesn't matter, as he cannot bring himself to deprive his
   son of a mother and, except for Lip, will never admit the truth to
   anyone.

   Della Guardia, his reputation destroyed by the trial, loses a recall
   election and Rusty is appointed to finish out his term, although his
   professional prospects beyond that are uncertain. The novel ends as
   Rusty reflects on Carolyn's murder, which remains officially unsolved
   nearly a year later. He wonders what led him into the affair which
   ultimately caused everything to happen, and concludes that it was an
   attempt to escape the existential crisis that has plagued him most of
   his adult life, even if what she offered him was never more than a
   fantasy.
