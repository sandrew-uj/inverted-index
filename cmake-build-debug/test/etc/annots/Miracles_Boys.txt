   The series follows the lives of two teenage boys and their older
   brother, who has to take responsibility for the boys after their
   parents die. The eldest Bailey brother, twenty-one-year-old Ty'ree
   (Pooch Hall), is a mail room manager at a publishing company. He was
   accepted into MIT prior to the events of the show, but declined the
   acceptance to raise his younger brothers. Charlie (Sean Nelson), the
   middle boy, has just gotten out of a juvenile detention facility and is
   mad at the universe. Once an avid pet lover and baseball fanatic, life
   behind bars has changed him. Lafayette (Julito McCullum), the youngest
   Bailey brother at age fourteen, loves and breathes baseball. However,
   his game has been out-of-sync since his mother's death. He goes on to
   play in a championship game, in which he faces an all-star team from
   Greenwich Village. The series follows the boys through the hardships of
   growing up on their own.
