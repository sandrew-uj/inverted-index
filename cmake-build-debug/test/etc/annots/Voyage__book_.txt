   The book tells the story in flashbacks during the actual Mars mission
   of the chronicalised history until the mission's beginning. The point
   of divergence for this alternate timeline happens on 22 November 1963,
   where John F. Kennedy survived the assassination (Jacqueline Kennedy
   was killed, hence the renaming of the Kennedy Space Center as the
   Jacqueline B. Kennedy Space Center), but was crippled and thus
   incapacitated, as Lyndon B. Johnson is still sworn in. On 20 July 1969,
   Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Joe Muldoon walk on the Moon,
   and Nixon's "most historic phone call" is joined by a call from former
   President Kennedy, committing the United States to send a crewed
   mission to Mars, which Nixon backs as part of his fateful decision to
   decide the future of crewed spaceflight, instead of deciding on the
   Space Shuttle program as he did in our timeline.

   Preparations for this new goal include slashing the number of Moon
   landings so funding and leftover Apollo spacecraft hardware can go
   towards the efforts of the crewed Mars mission. Apollo 12 still lands,
   Apollo 13 still suffers its disaster, but Apollo 14 is crewed by the
   astronauts of the cancelled Apollo 15 mission to carry out the
   scientific experiments on the lunar surface, and is the last crewed
   Moon landing. At the same time, the NERVA program is revived to become
   the chosen Mars spacecraft development, with larger tests in Nevada,
   but without containment and plagued with engineering problems.

   The book centres around chronicling the lives of the future Mars
   mission astronauts, NASA and contractor personnel all involved in
   making the mission become a reality, and the shifts within NASA's
   astronaut and management hierarchy throughout the mission's
   preparations, including female geologist Natalie York's quest to become
   an astronaut, and her stormy relationships with fellow astronaut Ben
   Priest and NERVA engineer Mike Conlig. Other astronauts include Ralph
   Gershon, a former fighter-bomber pilot involved in illegal bombing
   missions in Cambodia during the Vietnam War whose dream is to be the
   first black man in space, and Phil Stone, a veteran Air Force test
   pilot-turned-astronaut who has flown in a long-term stay on a lunar
   orbital station before the Mars mission.

   In the 1970s, the Skylab Space Station is launched, but apparently as a
   wet workshop design that is based on the Saturn IB S-IVB upper stage
   called Skylab A. The Saturn V that might have launched Skylab in our
   timeline instead launches Skylab B, a lunar orbit space station
   unofficially named "Moonlab", also a wet workshop based on the S-IVB.
   The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project is instead a series of visits by the
   Apollo Command/Service Module to Salyut space stations, and Soyuz
   missions to both Skylab and Moonlab. To facilitate the latter, the
   Soviets finally finish work on their N-1. The Skylab/Moonlab programs
   lead to improvements in the design of the Apollo Command/Service
   Module. A Block III CSM is produced using battery power in place of
   fuel cells, followed by the Block IV and V, which have a degree of
   reusability (modular construction and resistance to salt water
   corrosion). Also chronicled is the development of the experimental
   'Mars Excursion Module' by small aerospace firm Columbia Aviation as it
   struggles against larger rival contractors of NASA and its engineers
   working painstakingly against the technical challenges of a working and
   reliable Mars lander.

   A test of the NERVA, called Apollo-N, is finally launched atop the
   modified Saturn VN, but suffers from pogo oscillations in the S-IC
   first stage. This damages the NERVA upper stage, which catastrophically
   fails once fired in orbit; despite returning to Earth safely, the
   entire crew (including Ben Priest) is killed by radiation poisoning,
   and the space program nearly collapses from hostile political and
   public opinion against the use of nuclear power in space, and the
   seemingly unnecessary risks and reasons of a Mars mission.

   In the aftermath, a new Mars mission plan dubbed Ares is drawn up,
   utilising the upgraded Saturn V-B, which has numerous improvements,
   including the use of solid rocket boosters to double its payload. Ares
   also uses on-orbit assembly of a different long duration Mars-ship
   using wet-workshop Saturn rocket components as the propulsion systems
   as well as a Skylab habitat module and external tanks to hold extra
   fuel. Ares performs a Venus flyby reminiscent of the Manned Venus Flyby
   NASA planned in the aftermath of the original Apollo program, but done
   in this timeline for gravitational assistance, and finally lands at
   Mangala Valles on 27 March 1986.

   However, as a side effect, a number of uncrewed probes - including the
   Viking program, Pioneer Venus project, Mariner 10, Pioneers 10 and 11,
   and the Voyager program - are cancelled so that their funding can be
   redirected to the crewed Mars mission, although another Mariner orbiter
   is sent to Mars to help prepare for the crewed landing. As a result,
   although humans walk on Mars, their knowledge of the Solar System,
   including Mars itself and especially the outer solar system planets
   which never get visited without the Pioneer/Voyager missions, is far
   less than in reality.
