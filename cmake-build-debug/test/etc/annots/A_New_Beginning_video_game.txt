   The game starts in the far future. Due to ecological disasters life is
   only possible in caves deep under the ground. Many lifeforms and
   organisms have become extinct and even the human race is about to
   disappear. Some inventors were able to develop a time machine which
   uses some kind of radiocarbon dating. They now send some researchers
   back in time by using some sample which was made in the year 2050. Fay
   and her coworker arrive in a ruined San Francisco. Fay contacts the
   other time travelers, but they all end up in some natural disaster and
   most of them die. Salvador concludes their team must travel back in
   time to a year where ecological problems already exist, but still can
   be solved. In their search they find an article about Bent Svensson who
   invented a biofuel based upon blue algae. They also find an article how
   earth got partially destroyed after a nuclear reactor exploded in the
   Brazilian Amazon rainforest. This event destroyed the rain forest
   causing to start a chain reaction in which the earth went into a
   nuclear winter. The team travels back in time. However, it turns out
   Bent had to go on retirement due to health issues. The project is now
   led by his son Duve. Fay must convince Bent she really is from the
   future, the biofuel is the only solution to save the planet and the
   product must go in production right away. However, everyone has some
   reason to manipulate things for own purposes. This might fail the
   rescue of earth--or not.
