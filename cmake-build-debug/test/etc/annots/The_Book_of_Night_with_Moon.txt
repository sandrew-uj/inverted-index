   To her owners, apartment-dwellers on the upper East Side of New York's
   Manhattan Island, Rhiow looks like nothing more than their little black
   pet cat: a sweet-tempered, good-natured little creature who shakes them
   down for food at every opportunity, is always ready for a cuddle, and
   never ventures any further away than the apartment's terrace.

   But a lot more could be said about Rhiow...for when her humans aren't
   looking, she has a life of her own that they don't dream of. Rhiow is a
   wizard, and heads an elite team of other feline wizards whose job is to
   keep the Grand Central worldgates running. With her teammates Urruah (a
   dumpster-living, foodie tomcat with a yen for opera) and Saash (the
   "Scotty" of their team, cerebral and witty, but always scratching at
   fleas that aren't there), they help keep the city's wizardly public
   transport system purring along.

   ...Until one morning matters get suddenly complicated with the arrival
   of Arhu, an abrasive feral tom-kitten in the middle of his Ordeal--the
   potentially deadly initiation through which every wizard must pass to
   come into his or her power. The chain of events triggered by Arhu's
   adoption into their team leads Rhiow and her companions out of their
   own New York and into another, more ancient, and far deadlier one--to a
   confrontation with the Lone Power that's intent on the destruction of
   cats and humans alike.

   There, Rhiow and her team must deal with not only the sudden danger
   wound together with Arhu's fate, but a terrible secret concealed in the
   heart of the feline underworld, ready to burst out in annihilating
   force into the world of men, which as wizards they're sworn to protect.
   Now the cat-wizards' only hope of success lies in their uneasy bond
   with a race of creatures who've been their enemies for all time--and
   now hold the key not only to their own survival, but that of the human
   race...
