   The story begins in May 1844 with Miranda Wells, the daughter of a
   humble farmer in Greenwich, Connecticut. Abigail, Miranda's mother,
   receives a letter from Nicholas Van Ryn who is Abigail's maternal half
   first cousin and Patroon of a large manor called Dragonwyck near
   Hudson, New York. In the letter Van Ryn invites one of the Wells girls
   to Dragonwyck, to act as company for his six year old daughter Katrine.
   After initial doubts, Miranda's parents allow her to go to Dragonwyck
   where she is instantly attracted to and intrigued by the rich,
   mysterious and very dashing Nicholas, falling head over heels.

   Not everyone welcomes Miranda to Dragonwyck. Nicholas' corpulent and
   lazy wife, Johanna, sees Miranda as a threat, and tries to keep her
   from her husband. Soon, Miranda encounters kind Doctor Jeff(erson)
   Turner, a skilled physician and a passionate anti-renter who believes
   that rich Patroons, like the Van Ryns, should give up their large
   estates. Van Ryn and Turner instantly dislike each other, and because
   of his views, Miranda is baffled when Nicholas asks the doctor to
   attend to his wife, who has a cold. However, while Dr. Turner is at
   Dragonwyck, Johanna becomes violently ill and dies. As Dr. Turner
   leaves, wondering what caused such a sudden death, Nicholas asks
   Miranda to marry him. She accepts.

   Married life to Nicholas Van Ryn is far from what Miranda imagined.
   Despite him brutally forcing himself on her on their wedding night, she
   finds herself making excuses for him and staying by his side loyally
   but foolishly. As the story moves on, Nicholas's true mental state and
   his egotistical thirst for power become evident. After their newborn
   son dies, the relationship between Miranda and her now opium addicted
   husband withers, and the bonds between Miranda and Dr. Turner
   strengthen. Althlough the marriage then enters a potentially promising
   phase, this proves to be short-lived. Miranda's suspicions are aroused
   by Johanna's secret diary found in the attic and Dr. Turner eventually
   confirms to Miranda that Nicholas poisoned his frightened first wife
   with oleander resembling nutmeg on a cake. They confront him then plan
   escape, but Nicholas catches up with Miranda on a steamboat traveling
   down the Hudson River. The steamboat gets caught up in a race, catches
   fire, and crashes. Miranda is rescued by Nicholas, but he dies having
   rescued other passengers from the steamboat. After the ordeal, Miranda
   and Dr. Turner marry and plan to leave the Hudson Valley area forever,
   for a new life in California.
