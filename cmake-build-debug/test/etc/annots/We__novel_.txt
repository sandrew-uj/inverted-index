   A few hundred years after the One State's conquest of the entire world,
   the spaceship Integral is being built in order to invade and conquer
   extraterrestrial planets. Meanwhile, the project's chief engineer,
   D-503, begins a journal that he intends to be carried upon the
   completed spaceship.

   Like all other citizens of One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment
   building and is carefully watched by the secret police, or Bureau of
   Guardians. D-503's lover, O-90, has been assigned by One State to visit
   him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and
   is deeply grieved by her state in life. O-90's other lover and D-503's
   best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public
   executions.

   While on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330.
   I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks alcohol, and shamelessly flirts with
   D-503 instead of applying for an impersonal sex visit; all of these are
   highly illegal according to the laws of One State.

   Both repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his
   attraction to I-330. She invites him to visit the Ancient House,
   notable for being the only opaque building in One State, except for
   windows. Objects of aesthetic and historical importance dug up from
   around the city are stored there. There, I-330 offers him the services
   of a corrupt doctor to explain his absence from work. Leaving in
   horror, D-503 vows to denounce her to the Bureau of Guardians, but
   finds that he cannot.

   He begins to have dreams, which disturbs him, as dreams are thought to
   be a symptom of mental illness. Slowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she
   is involved with the Mephi, an organization plotting to bring down the
   One State. She takes him through secret tunnels inside the Ancient
   House to the world outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the
   city-state. There, D-503 meets the inhabitants of the outside world:
   humans whose bodies are covered with animal fur. The aims of the Mephi
   are to destroy the Green Wall and reunite the citizens of One State
   with the outside world.

   Despite the recent rift between them, O-90 pleads with D-503 to
   impregnate her illegally. After O-90 insists that she will obey the law
   by turning over their child to be raised by the One State, D-503
   obliges. However, as her pregnancy progresses, O-90 realizes that she
   cannot bear to be parted from her baby under any circumstances. At
   D-503's request, I-330 arranges for O-90 to be smuggled outside the
   Green Wall.

   In his last journal entry, D-503 indifferently relates that he has been
   forcibly tied to a table and subjected to the "Great Operation", which
   has recently been mandated for all citizens of One State in order to
   prevent possible riots;^[7] having been psycho-surgically refashioned
   into a state of mechanical "reliability", they would now function as
   "tractors in human form".^[8] This operation removes the imagination
   and emotions by targeting parts of the brain with X-rays. After this
   operation, D-503 willingly informed the Benefactor about the inner
   workings of the Mephi. However, D-503 expresses surprise that even
   torture could not induce I-330 to denounce her comrades. Despite her
   refusal, I-330 and those arrested with her have been sentenced to
   death, "under the Benefactor's Machine".

   Meanwhile, the Mephi uprising gathers strength; parts of the Green Wall
   have been destroyed, birds are repopulating the city, and people start
   committing acts of social rebellion. Although D-503 expresses hope that
   the Benefactor shall restore "reason", the novel ends with One State's
   survival in doubt. I-330's mantra is that, just as there is no highest
   number, there can be no final revolution.
