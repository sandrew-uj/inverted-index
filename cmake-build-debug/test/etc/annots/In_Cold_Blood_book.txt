   Three film adaptations have been produced based upon the book. The
   first focuses on the details of the book, whereas the later two explore
   Capote's fascination with researching the novel. In Cold Blood (1967)
   was directed by Richard Brooks and stars Robert Blake as Perry Smith
   and Scott Wilson as Richard Hickock. It features John Forsythe as
   investigator Alvin Dewey from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation who
   apprehended the killers. It was nominated for Best Director,
   Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, and Best Adapted
   Screenplay.

   The second and third films focus on Capote's experiences in writing the
   story and his subsequent fascination with the murders. Capote (2005)
   stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor
   for his portrayal of Truman Capote, Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith,
   and Catherine Keener as Harper Lee. The film was critically
   acclaimed, won at the 78th Academy Awards for Best Actor
   (Hoffman), and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress
   (Keener), Best Director (Bennett Miller), and Best Adapted Screenplay
   (Dan Futterman).

   J. T. Hunter's novel In Colder Blood (2016) discusses Hickock and
   Smith's possible involvement in the Walker family murders. Oni Press
   published Ande Parks and Chris Samnee's graphic novel Capote in Kansas
   (2005). Capote's book was adapted by Benedict Fitzgerald into the
   two-part television miniseries In Cold Blood (1996), starring Anthony
   Edwards as Dick Hickock, Eric Roberts as Perry Smith, and Sam Neill as
   Alvin Dewey.
