   Holly Martins, an American author of western fiction, arrives in
   post-Second World War Vienna (which has been divided among the Allies:
   the Americans, British, French, and Soviets) seeking his childhood
   friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job. Martins is told that
   Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral,
   Martins meets two British Royal Military Police: Sergeant Paine, a fan
   of Martins's books, and his superior, Major Calloway. Afterwards,
   Martins is asked by Mr. Crabbin to give a lecture to a book club a few
   days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, "Baron" Kurtz, who tells
   Martins that he and another friend, a Romanian called Popescu, carried
   Lime to the side of the street after the accident. Before he died, Lime
   asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna
   Schmidt.

   Martins goes to the theatre to meet Anna, quickly becoming suspicious
   that Lime's death was not an accident. Anna's secondhand account of the
   fatal accident that Lime's doctor just happened to be passing by and
   that he was run over by his own driver just seemed too hard for Martins
   to believe; even Anna thinks Lime's death may not have been an
   accident. The porter at Lime's apartment building says that Lime was
   killed immediately and that three men carried the body, not two.
   Martins and Anna discover that the police are searching her flat. They
   discover a forged passport, confiscate it and detain her. The next
   evening Martins visits Lime's "medical adviser" Dr. Winkel, who says
   that he arrived at the accident after Lime was dead and claims only two
   men were there.

   The porter offers to give Martins more information, but someone kills
   him before Martins can talk to him. When Martins arrives with Anna, the
   crowd believes that he was involved and they become hostile, but they
   manage to escape the angry crowd. Martins returns to the hotel and a
   cab immediately takes him to the book club, where he makes a very poor
   speech. When Popescu enters, he asks about Martins's next book. Martins
   says that it will be called The Third Man, "a murder story" inspired by
   facts. Popescu tells Martins that he should stick to fiction. Martins
   then notices two thugs advancing towards him, so he flees on foot
   through the ruins of the bombed out city and manages to escape.

   Calloway again advises Martins to leave Vienna, but Martins refuses and
   demands that Lime's death be investigated. Calloway reveals that Lime's
   racket was stealing penicillin from military hospitals, diluting it,
   then selling it on the black market, injuring or killing many. Martins,
   once convinced, agrees to leave.

   Martins visits Anna that evening, learning that she has also been told
   through Calloway about Lime's crimes. Leaving her apartment, Martins
   notices someone hiding and watching from a darkened doorway. A shaft of
   light reveals the person to be Lime. Ignoring Martins's calls, Lime
   flees and vanishes. Martins summons Calloway, who deduces that Lime has
   escaped through the sewers. The British police exhume Lime's coffin and
   discover that the body is that of the orderly who stole the penicillin
   for Lime. Anna is about to be ordered to the Soviet sector and is
   questioned once again by Calloway.

   The next day, Martins meets Lime and they ride Vienna's Ferris wheel,
   the Wiener Riesenrad. Lime obliquely threatens Martins, reveals the
   full extent of his ruthlessness and then reiterates his job offer
   before leaving quickly. Calloway then asks Martins to help capture
   Lime. Martins agrees to help only on one condition, demanding in
   exchange Anna's safe conduct out of Vienna. Martins and Anna meet. She
   learns of the plan, but wants no part of it. Exasperated, Martins
   decides to leave, but on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a
   hospital to show Martins a number of children crippled or dying of
   meningitis, who were treated with Lime's diluted penicillin.

   Lime arrives at a small cafe to rendezvous with Martins, where Anna
   warns Lime that the police are closing in. He tries once again to
   escape using the sewer tunnels, but the police are there in force. Lime
   shoots and kills Paine, but Calloway shoots and wounds Lime. Badly
   injured, Lime drags himself up a ladder to a street grating, but he
   cannot lift it. Martins then kills Lime using Paine's revolver. Later,
   Martins attends Lime's second funeral. At the risk of missing his
   flight out of Vienna, he waits on the street to speak with Anna, but
   she ignores and walks right past him.
