   Malazan Book of the Fallen is a series of epic fantasy novels written
   by the Canadian author Steven Erikson. The series, published by Bantam
   Books in the U.K. and Tor Books in the U.S., consists of ten volumes,
   beginning with Gardens of the Moon (1999) and concluding with The
   Crippled God (2011). Erikson's series is extremely complex with a wide
   scope, and presents the narratives of a large cast of characters
   spanning thousands of years across multiple continents.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4]

   His plotting presents a complicated series of events in the world upon
   which the Malazan Empire is located. Each of the first five novels is
   relatively self-contained, in that each resolves its respective primary
   conflict; but many underlying characters and events are interwoven
   throughout the works of the series, binding it together. The Malazan
   world was co-created by Steven Erikson and Ian Cameron Esslemont in the
   early 1980s as a backdrop to their GURPS roleplaying campaign.^[5] In
   2005, Esslemont began publishing his own series of six novels set in
   the same world, beginning with Night of Knives. Although Esslemont's
   books are published under a different series title - Novels of the
   Malazan Empire - Esslemont and Erikson collaborated on the storyline
   for the entire sixteen-book project and Esslemont's novels are
   considered to be as canonical and integral to the series' mythos as
   Erikson's own.

   The series has received widespread critical acclaim, with reviewers
   praising the epic scope, plot complexity and characterizations, and
   fellow authors such as Glen Cook (The Black Company) and Stephen R.
   Donaldson (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant) hailing it as a
   masterwork of the imagination, and comparing Erikson to the likes of
   Joseph Conrad, Henry James, William Faulkner, and Fyodor
   Dostoevsky.^[6]^[7]^[8]
