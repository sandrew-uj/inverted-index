   The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many
   places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially
   for each new adaptation. Throughout all versions, the series
   follows the adventures of Arthur Dent, a hapless Englishman, following
   the destruction of the Earth by the Vogons (a race of unpleasant and
   bureaucratic aliens) to make way for an intergalactic bypass. Dent's
   adventures intersect with several other characters: Ford Prefect (an
   alien and researcher for the eponymous guidebook who rescues Dent from
   Earth's destruction), Zaphod Beeblebrox (Ford's eccentric semi-cousin
   and the Galactic President who has stolen the Heart of Gold -- a
   spacecraft equipped with Infinite Improbability Drive), the depressed
   robot Marvin the Paranoid Android, and Trillian (formerly known as
   Tricia McMillan) who is a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington
   and who -- thanks to Beeblebrox's intervention -- is the only other
   human survivor of Earth's destruction.

   In their travels, Arthur comes to learn that the Earth was actually a
   giant supercomputer, created by another supercomputer, Deep Thought.
   Deep Thought had been built by its creators to give the answer to the
   "Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything", which, after
   eons of calculations, was given simply as "42". Deep Thought was then
   instructed to design the Earth supercomputer to determine what the
   Question actually is. The Earth was subsequently destroyed by the
   Vogons moments before its calculations were completed, and Arthur
   becomes the target of the descendants of the Deep Thought creators,
   believing his mind must hold the Question. With his friends' help,
   Arthur escapes and they decide to have lunch at The Restaurant at the
   End of the Universe, before embarking on further adventures.
