   In 2005, U.S. Army librarian Corporal Joe Bauers is selected for a
   suspended animation experiment as the "most average" individual in the
   entire armed forces. Lacking a suitable female candidate, the military
   hires a prostitute named Rita by bribing her pimp Upgrayedd. When the
   officer in charge is arrested for running his own prostitution ring
   under Upgrayedd's tutelage, the experiment is forgotten. Over the next
   five centuries, societal expectations lead the most intelligent humans
   to choose not to have children while the least intelligent reproduce
   indiscriminately, creating increasingly dumber generations.

   In 2505, Joe and Rita's suspension chambers are unearthed by the
   collapse of a mountain-sized garbage pile; Joe's chamber crashes into
   the apartment of Frito Pendejo. Wandering around what was once
   Washington, D.C., Joe finds a population that has become profoundly
   anti-intellectual, speaking only low registers of English and wallowing
   in overconsumption and crass popular entertainment. Technology is
   advanced but often malfunctioning, driven by garish commercialism.
   Believing he is hallucinating after a year of hibernation, Joe enters a
   hospital and realizes the truth. Arrested for not having a bar code
   tattoo to pay for his doctor's appointment, he is sent to prison after
   being assigned the grossly incompetent Pendejo as his lawyer.

   Rita also leaves her chamber, resuming work as a prostitute, but soon
   realizes that people have become so stupid that she can charge
   customers money without actual services. Joe is renamed "Not Sure" by a
   faulty speech-recognition tattooing machine and takes a rudimentary IQ
   test, then tricks a guard by claiming that he is meant to be released,
   and simply runs out the door, successfully escaping prison in one
   piece. He finds Frito, who reveals that a time machine exists to return
   him to 2005, and Joe bribes him with promises of riches through
   compound interest on a bank account he will open for Frito in the 21st
   century. Leading Joe and Rita to the time machine, Frito takes them
   into a gigantic Costco store, where Joe is identified by a tattoo
   scanner and apprehended.

   Taken to the White House, Joe is appointed Secretary of the Interior,
   as the IQ test identified him as the most intelligent person alive.
   President Camacho introduces Joe to the cabinet, and gives him the
   impossible job of fixing the nationwide food shortages, dust bowls, and
   crippled economy within a week. Joe discovers that the nation's crops
   are irrigated with Brawndo, a "thirst mutilator" whose parent
   corporation owns the FDA, FCC, and USDA. When Joe has the irrigation
   system replaced with water, Brawndo's stock drops to zero and half of
   the population lose their jobs, causing mass riots.

   Joe is sentenced to die in a monster truck demolition derby featuring
   undefeated "rehabilitation officer" Beef Supreme. However, Beef's
   oversized vehicle is crushed trying to enter the arena, and Joe manages
   to defeat the other vehicles. Rita and Frito discover that Joe's
   reintroduction of water to the soil has allowed vegetation to grow.
   Showing the sprouting crops on the stadium's Jumbotron, prompts
   Camacho's presidential pardon. Joe and Rita decide to stay in the
   future, although later they discover they had no choice as the "time
   masheen" Frito mentioned is merely a childishly inaccurate
   history-themed amusement ride. Following Camacho's term, Joe is elected
   president and marries Rita. They conceive the world's three smartest
   children, while new Vice President Frito takes eight wives and fathers
   thirty-two of the world's stupidest children.

   In a post-credits scene, Upgrayedd awakens from a suspension chamber,
   setting off in search of Rita.
