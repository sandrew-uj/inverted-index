   In this lightly comic novel about work, love, wealth and fame the main
   character of Jake Donaghue, a struggling writer and translator, seeks
   to improve his circumstances and make up for past mistakes by
   reconnecting with his old acquaintance Hugo Belfounder, a mild mannered
   and soft spoken philosopher.

   Jake, a shameless mooch and hack-writer - now homeless and out of other
   solid options - tracks down his ex-girlfriend, Anna Quentin, and her
   elegant sister, an actress named Sadie. He also reacquaints himself
   with Hugo, whose philosophy Jake had long ago presumptuously tried to
   decipher and interpret to his own liking. The plot develops through a
   series of adventures involving Jake and his offbeat minion, Finn. From
   the kidnapping of a movie-star canine to the staging of a political
   riot on a film set, Jake attempts to discover and incorporate Hugo's
   abstruse philosophies in real life situations. Berated yet enlightened,
   Jake's aspirations to become a true writer/philosopher may at last be
   at hand.
