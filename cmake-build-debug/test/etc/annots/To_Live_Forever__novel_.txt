   The city of Clarges in the future is a near-utopia, surrounded by
   barbarism throughout the rest of the world. Abundant resources and the
   absence of political conflict lead to a pleasant life that should be
   stress-free. However, nearly everyone is obsessed with a perpetual
   scramble for longer life, as measured by slope.

   Medical technology has led to a great lengthening of the human
   lifespan, but, in order to prevent the Malthusian horrors of
   overpopulation, it is awarded only to those citizens who have made
   notable contributions. Five categories have been created for those
   playing the life-extension game, the first four each offering an
   additional twenty years of life. One's progress can be shown as a
   graph, whose upward direction indicates a greater likelihood of
   achieving the next level. Therefore, the slope of one's "lifeline" is a
   measure of success. A person whose lifeline reaches the vertical
   terminator is not merely deprived of life-lengthening treatment, they
   are deliberately eliminated by government operatives, known as
   "Assassins".

   The ultimate prize is the top category, called Amaranth, which offers
   true immortality to the fortunate few. People who achieve this
   distinction are accorded the honorific "The" in front of their name.

   The Grayven Warlock was one of those few, but he has become a fugitive
   after a feud with another Amaranth resulted in the latter's death.
   Masquerading as his own "relict" (clone) using the name Gavin Waylock,
   he lives in obscurity, looking for the accomplishment that will
   reinstate him among the immortals. However, Waylock's dramatic
   stratagems result in changes to society far beyond anything he had
   intended.
