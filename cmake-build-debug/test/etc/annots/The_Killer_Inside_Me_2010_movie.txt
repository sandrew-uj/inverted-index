   In 1952, Deputy Sheriff Lou Ford is a pillar of his small west Texas
   community; secretly, he is a sociopath with violent sexual tastes. As a
   teenager, Lou was caught raping a five-year-old girl by his adopted
   brother Mike, who pleaded guilty to the crime to protect Lou. Released
   from prison, Mike was hired by Chester Conway, and died in a
   construction "accident" Lou believes was staged by Conway.

   At the request of Sheriff Bob Maples, Lou visits Joyce Lakeland, a
   prostitute who is having an affair with Conway's son, Elmer. When she
   continuously provokes him with slaps, Lou violently beats Joyce, who
   enjoys pain, and they begin their own affair. They devise a plot to
   extort $10,000 from Conway. Maples and Conway ask Lou to oversee the
   payoff, but Lou enacts his own plan: he brutally beats Joyce and,
   believing her dead, shoots and kills Elmer, planting the gun on Joyce.
   However, Joyce survives, and Conway intends to see her executed for
   Elmer's murder.

   Lou's reputation begins to falter: his fiancee Amy suspects his
   infidelity, and county district attorney Howard Hendricks suspects Lou
   is the real killer. Lou accompanies Maples and Conway in taking Joyce
   to the hospital in Fort Worth so Conway can interrogate her. Lou waits
   in a hotel room during her surgery, and Maples tells him Joyce died on
   the operating table.

   Returning home, Lou discovers explicit photographs inside a Bible. The
   woman in the photographs was Helene, a housekeeper and babysitter from
   his youth who resembles Joyce. Lou recalls that Helene introduced him
   to sadomasochism, and burns the photos.

   Hendricks arrests Johnnie Pappas, a local youth Lou had befriended, as
   a suspect in the murders. He is found with one of Conway's marked $20
   bills, given to him by Lou. Hendricks asks Lou to persuade Johnnie to
   confess; in Johnnie's cell, Lou confesses to Johnnie that he is the
   killer, and hangs Johnnie to make it appear as though he committed
   suicide out of guilt.

   Johnnie's death only makes the town more suspicious of Lou. Journalist
   and union organizer Joe Rothman, who had previously suggested that
   Conway had Mike killed, implies that he knows Lou is the killer. Lou
   proposes to Amy, and to sate his violent predilections, she allows him
   to spank her. An alcoholic bum, whom Lou had previously burnt with a
   cigar, has been trailing Lou and knows he is responsible for the
   murders. He demands $5,000 to keep quiet, to which Lou agrees. On the
   day Lou and Amy had planned to elope, Lou beats her to death; the bum
   sees her body and runs for help. Lou gives chase, shouting that the bum
   has murdered Amy, and another deputy, Jeff Plummer, shoots the bum
   dead.

   The next morning, Plummer informs Lou that Maples, convinced of Lou's
   guilt, has committed suicide. Lou cockily refuses to Hendricks and
   Plummer. They find a letter Amy intended to give Lou in which she begs
   him to come clean. Lou is arrested and sent to an insane asylum, where
   he suffers hallucinations of Amy and Helene. Attorney Billy Boy Walker,
   hired by Rothman, has Lou released. Lou tells Walker everything and
   concludes that he doesn't want anyone else to die.

   Lost in violent fantasies, Lou douses his home in gasoline and alcohol,
   arms himself with a knife, and sits in his study to await retribution.
   The police arrive with Hendricks, Conway, Plummer and the still-alive
   Joyce. She tells Lou that she refused to cooperate with the
   authorities, Lou tells her he loves her, then stabs her in the stomach.
   Plummer opens fire, hitting both Joyce and Lou and igniting the
   gasoline. Outside, the approaching policemen watch the house engulfed
   in a fireball that Lou has ignited to kill himself.
