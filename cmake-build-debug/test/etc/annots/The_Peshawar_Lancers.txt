   The story details a world where a heavy meteor shower, known as "the
   Fall", impacted with catastrophic force across much of the Northern
   Hemisphere in 1878, creating a massive dust cloud that blots out the
   sun. This in turn causes the collapse of Industrialized civilization,
   which was unable to survive without the ability to raise crops in
   winter-like conditions that lasted for three years. In order to
   survive, the British Government, under the leadership of Queen Victoria
   and Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, employed the Royal Navy and all
   merchant shipping to evacuate the population of the British Isles to
   its colonies in India, Australasia, and South Africa over the next
   several years. After martial law breaks down in 1881, the rioting
   British lower classes storm the remaining military outposts in London;
   unable to escape, Disraeli is killed by rioters and becomes a martyr.
   The British Isles are abandoned, initially becoming the home of groups
   of degenerate cannibalistic savages, most of which quickly consume each
   other to extinction, and are only cautiously recolonized in the 20th
   Century. By the time relatively normal weather returns, nine-tenths of
   the former population in the UK, as well as millions of other people
   around the world, have died as a result of the disaster.

   The book is set in the year 2025, after the world's climate has
   recovered from the devastation of the meteors. The political geography
   of the time is dramatically different from our own world, and
   innovations such as the airship and Stirling engine are only beginning
   to reach prominence while the airplane and internal combustion engine
   were still undeveloped. The Angrezi Raj (formerly the British Empire),
   centered in its former colonies in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans,
   is the most powerful nation on Earth. It stands alongside other
   surviving world powers, including France-outre-mer (a European-settled
   French North Africa), the Caliphate of Damascus (a united Middle East),
   the Empire of Dai-Nippon (a Japanese-ruled China and Far East), and the
   Russian Empire (a remnant of the original, now located in central
   Asia).

   Athelstane King is an officer of the Peshawar Lancers, a regiment that
   guards the northern borders of the Angrezi Raj, who becomes involved in
   an adventure filled with political intrigue, numerous chases, harrowing
   escapes, swashbuckling, and the exploration of a world that seems to be
   forever trapped in the Victorian era. The novel features many
   similarities to the styles of writing of such famous authors as Rudyard
   Kipling and H. Rider Haggard, which serve as both homage and satire to
   their works, along with elements of colonialist attitude, cultism, and
   general fantasy.
