   Beyonders follows the exploits of a slightly neglected,
   thirteen-year-old boy, Jason Walker.

   Jason leads a relatively normal life until one day at the zoo, when he
   notices strange music coming from the mouth of a hippo. While leaning
   over the hippo tank's guard rail, he falls in. The hippo swallows him,
   but instead of being digested, he's transported to a different world
   called Lyrian.

   After wandering a short way, he learns that the group of musicians
   playing the music that he heard are called the Giddy Nine and that they
   plan to ride a raft over a nearby waterfall. In an attempt to save
   them, he talks to the rescue squad present and asks them why they are
   not rescuing the band. The archer states that they are just there so
   that if someone decides to turn back they can help. Before the raft
   reaches the end of the waterfall, Jason pushes the little man with one
   arm into the river and grabs the archer's bow with an arrow attached to
   a rescue line. He aims to shoot the line onto the boat in order to give
   the band something to grab onto, but instead, his shot goes awry and
   the arrow pierces the shoulder of one of the musicians. One musician is
   able to jump to shore before the line is cut by the archer but the rest
   plummet off the edge of the waterfall. The archer had helped the little
   man out the river so the archer and the little man who was part of the
   rescue squad pursue Jason for interfering, so Jason runs off into the
   woods.

   After this, Jason aimlessly wanders into the Repository of Learning,
   where he's informed by the Librarian/Loremaster that it's an extremely
   difficult place to reach. The Loremaster offers Jason food, shelter,
   and virtually unlimited access to the Repository's enormous wealth of
   books as a reward for completing the journey. Jason accepts the offer,
   figuring that there would be no better place for him to discover a way
   home than one of such vast knowledge. Later, the Loremaster informs
   Jason that the second story of the building is strictly prohibited.
   Finding the books on the first floor to be of little use, he lets
   curiosity overwhelm him. After discovering the method by which to open
   the extremely complex lock (almost a puzzle) guarding the second floor,
   Jason ventures inside at night. He finds the place (as well as the
   books inside) to be eerie and sinister. After wandering about for a
   bit, he stumbles across a large text entitled, The Book of Salzared.
   The book is bound in human skin and has tiny pores, fine hairs and
   light blue veins. It is also warm to the touch because it was made with
   a displacer's skin. Upon opening it, Jason discovers a strong warning
   stating that anyone who reads further will place themselves in peril.
   He reads on, valuing the potential to discover a way home over the risk
   involved. After reading a short section describing the first syllable
   of a mysterious word to defeat Maldor, the evil wizard ruler of Lyrian,
   he closes the book, when a seemingly human eye opens out of the cover.
   Terrified, Jason panics, dropping the book and his candle and making a
   racket. Stumbling in the dark, he's found by the loremaster's dog, who
   leads him to the loremaster. The loremaster then informs Jason that
   he's sealed his own fate, and must leave immediately in search of
   someone called the Blind King. After being given directions to the
   Blind King as well as some food, Jason leaves the Repository of
   Learning.

   After arriving at the Blind King's decrepit keep, Jason learns that the
   "Blind King" is really Galloran, a broken hero who already tried and
   failed on the same quest that Jason is now committed to. A few moments
   after learning of Galloran's true identity, Jason is introduced to
   Rachel, a girl his age from 'the Beyond", who arrived in Lyrian by
   walking through a stone arch. Galloran then tells them that they are
   crucial to a prophecy spoken by a powerful seer, one in which they will
   destroy the tyrannical wizard emperor, Maldor. Galloran points out that
   the easiest (though still extremely difficult) way to accomplish this
   is to seek the Word, a powerful spell that will destroy Maldor when
   spoken in his presence. The first syllable of the Word has already been
   discovered by Jason at the repository of learning ('a'). Each syllable
   of The Word is protected by a guardian, each of whom will only reveal
   their syllable to those embarked on the quest to destroy Maldor.
   However, some syllables have also been written down (such as the one at
   the repository of learning), removing the necessity of directly seeking
   out the guardians of those syllables. They may only speak or write The
   Word in its entirety once, after which the individual that did so will
   forget it. Since Jason was the only one to read the book containing
   this information, Rachel may opt out. However, she decides to join him.
   Satisfied with their decision, Galloran presents Jason with a dagger
   whose blade shoots out of the handle at the pressing of a button on the
   pommel, while Rachel is given an Orantium sphere, a type of grenade
   with an explosive crystal encased in glass that explodes when exposed
   to air or water. He also names Jason as the lord of a previously fallen
   estate. After being given a starting point by Galloran, Jason and
   Rachel embark on a quest for the Word.

   Jason and Rachel go down a cliff to reach the first guardian in a
   submerged cave. Jason goes into the cave, and Rachel is washed in after
   him. They then learn the fourth syllable of the word and that it has
   six syllables, and that they should visit a disgraced lord named
   Nicholas Dangler in Trensicourt for further clues to the locations of
   the syllables. The pair manage to avoid the giant crab guarding the
   exit, and it kills an enchanted hound that was pursuing them for
   Maldor.

   On the way to Trensicourt, Jason and Rachel encounter the lone survivor
   of the Giddy Nine, a man named Tark. Jason manages to talk Tark out of
   his survivor's guilt, and convinces him to join the rebellion against
   Maldor. They also meet a Ferrin, a displacer capable of separating and
   reattaching his limbs. Ferrin joins Jason and Rachel on their journey,
   and helps them both when they are attacked by the rescuers from the
   Giddy Nine, who have been conscripted by the emperor's men. One of the
   rescuers is killed by Ferrin, and the trio is arrested by the
   constable. Jason, Rachel, and Ferrin escape and travel to Trensicourt,
   where Ferrin is forced to separate from Jason and Rachel due to his
   previous execution inside the city.

   Jason and Rachel meet with Nicholas Dangler, and learn that the third
   syllable is hidden within a chamber in the castle. The only way to
   access this chamber is by beating the Trensicourt Chancellor at a
   battle of wits. Nicholas had been disgraced for challenging and losing
   to the chancellor. Jason manages to use his status as lord to challenge
   the Chancellor, and miraculously manages to beat him and learn the
   third syllable in the process.

   That night, Jason is attacked and almost killed by an assassin in the
   night, but manages to escape. The ruler of Trensicourt also shows Jason
   that he has received an invitation to Harthenham, a paradisaical castle
   where Maldor invites his enemies in exchange for their allegiance.

   Jason, under the pretense of leaving for Harthenham, meets with Ferrin
   and Rachel and travels to the location of the fifth syllable, an island
   in the center of a strange lake called Whitelake. The water in
   Whitelake does not allow boats to float, however it hardens when put
   under pressure. Rachel manages to run to the island in the center of
   the lake before collapsing of exhaustion. Afterwards, she finds a cave
   and meets a displacer named Malar, who has been reduced to a severed
   head and arm only. Rachel learns the next syllable and Malar also
   reveals that Ferrin is most-likely working for Maldor. After returning
   to shore, Ferrin confirms this is true and he parts ways peacefully
   from Rachel and Jason.

   Rachel and Jason head to the location of the sixth syllable, a prophet
   living in the center of the swampy Sunken Lands. On the way there, they
   are attacked by Maldor's men, however they are saved by Jasher, who is
   from a species capable of resurrecting if there "seed" is planted
   again. In the sunken lands, they meet the prophet's daughter, Corine,
   who is unable to leave her home in the Sunken Lands due to special
   puffballs that cause memory loss. The group successfully collect the
   sixth syllable, and also learn that Galloran had hidden the second
   syllable as a tattoo on the body of a man named Kimp, who works for
   Maldor. Jasher reveals that Kimp lives within Harthenham, and decide to
   use Jason's invitation to get inside.

   Jason infiltrates Harthenham and finds Tark inside, having received an
   invitation after killing men working for Maldor. Jason manages to
   identify the final piece of the Word, and he and Tark hatch a plan to
   escape. Jason is challenged to a duel with the host, and he chooses
   billiard balls as a weapon, easily winning thanks to his pitching
   skills from Earth. They are joined in their escape by a man named
   Tristan and Drake, a seedling like Jasher who is on his final life. The
   four leave but are attacked by Kimp and a pack of dogs. Tristan,
   Jasher, and Kimp are killed in the ensuing battle, and Jason is
   captured.

   Drake rescues Jason and the two continue to Felrook, where Maldor
   lives. Jason gains an audience with him and uses the Word, however, it
   is revealed that Maldor actually masterminded the Word himself to
   distract those who wished to harm him. Jason is imprisoned and
   tortured.

   Jason is rescued by Ferrin, who takes him to a portal back to Earth and
   sends him through. Jason resists, and ends up pulling Ferrin's severed
   hand along with him. Jason lands back on Earth, and swears to find a
   way back to Lyrian to save his friends.
