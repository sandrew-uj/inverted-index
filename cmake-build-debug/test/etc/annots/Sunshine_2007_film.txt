   In 2057, the Sun is dying and Earth is freezing. Eight international
   astronauts pilot a colossal stellar bomb aboard the spaceship Icarus
   II, with the intent of jump-starting the Sun and then returning to
   Earth. As they slingshot past Mercury, Icarus II picks up the distress
   beacon of Icarus I, the first ship to attempt a similar mission, which
   disappeared seven years earlier. The ship's proximity to Mercury kept
   its signals from reaching Earth, but allowed Icarus II to intercept it.
   Reasoning that two payloads have a better chance of success than one,
   the ship's physicist Capa recommends to Kaneda, the captain, that they
   change course and commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer,
   opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates and
   implements a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign
   the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to four
   shield panels which if not repaired could destroy the whole ship and
   kill the crew.

   Kaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by the
   pilot, Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from
   the Sun. As expected, this leads to the loss of two protruding
   communications towers; however, reflected light also destroys the
   ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves, much to the horror of
   botanist Corazon. As Icarus II's autopilot returns the shield to its
   original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to retreat to safety as he
   repairs the final panel himself, and is burned to death moments later.
   Trey is unable to cope with the loss of Kaneda, and the ship's
   psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk and sedates him,
   putting him in a catatonic state.

   Without enough oxygen to reach the release point for its explosive
   payload, Icarus II has no choice but to dock with Icarus I. Capa,
   Searle, Mace, and communications officer Harvey, now the acting
   captain, search the vessel, leaving Cassie and Corazon on board Icarus
   II with Trey. They discover that despite the ship's systems being
   mostly operational, including a lush, overgrown, oxygen garden, the
   mainframe has been sabotaged, rendering delivery of the payload
   impossible. The ship's log contains a rambling message from Pinbacker,
   its captain, who abandoned his mission and has severe burns on his
   face. Mace deduces that the transmission was made six and a half years
   ago, around the time when the crew should have delivered their payload.
   The crew of Icarus I is found in the solar observation room, burned to
   death long ago by unfiltered exposure to the Sun.

   Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus I's
   outer airlock and stranding the four crewmembers. With only one
   spacesuit available, Mace suggests that Capa wear it, over Harvey's
   attempts to order Capa to give the suit to him, and the rest of them
   wrap themselves in salvaged insulation material from the walls of the
   ship and then jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for
   propulsion. Searle realizes that one of them must stay behind to
   manually operate the airlock and volunteers himself. Searle releases
   the airlock, shooting Capa, Harvey and Mace out into open space. Harvey
   misses the airlock, freezes, and dies from asphyxiation, while Capa and
   Mace make it back to Icarus II, though Mace gets frostbite. Searle,
   having spent the mission obsessed with looking into the shielded sun,
   voluntarily exposes himself to its full, deadly force in the
   observation room, killing himself in the process.

   Corazon calculates that there is only enough oxygen left for four of
   the five survivors to reach the Sun, and tries to reach a consensus on
   which one of them will die to save the others. After a contentious
   vote, Mace decides to kill Trey, but discovers Trey has already
   committed suicide. With the remaining crew somewhat relieved that they
   will now at least make the trip to the Sun, Capa is informed by Icarus
   that there is still not enough oxygen to complete the mission because
   an unknown fifth person is on board the ship. Capa investigates and
   discovers an insane and disfigured Pinbacker. Pinbacker attacks and
   wounds Capa, who locks himself inside the airlock. Pinbacker then kills
   Corazon and removes the four mainframes from their coolant baths,
   shutting down the ship's computer, before going after Cassie.

   Mace manually lowers two of the computers back into the freezing
   coolant, but when his leg catches on the third descending mainframe, he
   becomes trapped, and the computer system is disabled. As he freezes to
   death, he begs Capa to complete the mission. Capa blows the airlock and
   separates the bomb from the ship, which is burned away by the sun. He
   then enters the bomb, where he finds Cassie, but they are ambushed by
   Pinbacker, who claims he spent the last seven years conversing with God
   and was told to send all humanity to Heaven. As they hurtle into the
   Sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker by ripping the skin off one of his arms.
   Cassie encourages Capa to ignite the bomb, and he manages to reach the
   controls. Unsure if it will work under these extreme conditions, he
   watches as the bomb begins to successfully ignite at the edge of the
   Sun itself, killing Cassie and Pinbacker. As time and space distort,
   Capa uses his final moments to blissfully reach out and touch the
   surface of the Sun.

   Back on Earth, at the frozen Sydney Harbour, Capa's sister and her
   children listen to Capa's last transmission and witness the Sun's light
   starting to shine again, the crew having accomplished their mission.
