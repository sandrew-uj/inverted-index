   Alcott patiently drudged away at Little Women but found emotional
   release in scribbling her blood-and-thunder tales. The difference
   shows: in pacing, tone, and content, Love Chase is startlingly unlike
   its famous successor. The ostentatiously Faustian plot centers on
   Rosamond Vivian, a discontented maiden who lives on an English island
   with only her bitter old grandfather for company and who begins the
   novel by rashly declaring: "I often feel as if I'd gladly sell my soul
   to Satan for a year of freedom." Right on cue, a man named Phillip
   Tempest -- a man who bears a more than trivial resemblance to
   Mephistopheles -- walks in the door. Within a month, Rosamond is in
   love, and although she realizes that this man is "no saint", she
   marries him, believing with the fatuousness of youth that her love will
   save him. She sails away from her lonely island in Tempest's yacht, the
   Circe, and begins her married life at a luxurious villa in Nice.

   Much to his own surprise, Tempest, a heartless libertine, finds that
   he, too, has fallen in love. He tries to make Rosamond happy, and
   succeeds for a while; however, after a year in his company, she begins
   to realize how conscienceless and cruel he is. She then discovers that
   Tempest has a wife and son already, making their marriage a sham and
   Rosamond the unwitting mistress of a man who has grossly deceived her.
   That same night, she packs a few items, stealthily climbs down from her
   second-floor balcony, and catches the next train to Paris. Tempest
   pursues her, beginning the obsessive "chase" of the title.

   Tempest hunts Rosamond for two years, telling her he enjoys the sport.
   To throw him off the track, she assumes a variety of disguises: in
   Paris, she's a seamstress named "Ruth"; next, she escapes to a convent,
   where she's known as "Sister Agatha"; after that, under the name
   "Rosalie Varian", she travels to Germany as companion to a wealthy
   little girl. Each time, as she begins to settle comfortably into a new
   life, Tempest makes a sudden, funhouse-type entrance and ruins
   everything. Under this treatment, Rosamond learns to hate and fear her
   former lover. At the same time, a hopeless passion develops between
   Rosamond and Father Ignatius, a handsome, virtuous, high-born man who
   happens -- unfortunately -- to be a Roman Catholic priest.

   The chase finally - tragically - ends the night Ignatius attempts to
   help Rosamond return to her grandfather's island.
