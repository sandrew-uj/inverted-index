   Mary Yellan, 23 years old, was brought up on a farm in Helford. After
   her father's and later her mother's death and with the subsequent decay
   of their farm, she is forced to sell it and their surviving animals,
   and as a promise to her, Mary goes on a day at the end of November in a
   coach trip with her only belongings in one simple chest to live with
   her only surviving relative: her mother's sister, Patience Merlyn, in a
   coaching inn called Jamaica Inn. Patience's husband, Joss Merlyn, is a
   local bully, stands almost seven feet tall and is a drunk. On arriving
   at the gloomy and threatening inn, Mary finds her formerly preety,
   merry and friendly aunt, who had once been proposed by a prosper and
   honest farmer who loved her, in a ghost-like state under the thumb of
   the vicious Joss, and soon realises that something unusual is afoot at
   the inn, which has no guests and is open to the public only to serve
   food and mostly drink. She tries to squeeze the truth out of her uncle
   during one of his benders, but he tells her, "I'm not drunk enough to
   tell you why I live in this God-forgotten spot, and why I'm the
   landlord of Jamaica Inn".

   Against her better judgement, Mary becomes attracted to Joss's younger
   brother, Jem, a self-admitting petty horse thief, but less brutal than
   his elder brother. It is known that another older brother of his,
   Matthew "Matt" Merlyn, drowned in a moor and only later on a hot Summer
   was discovered, and that in the past two generations of Merlyns all
   were criminals, none died from a natural death and all mistreated their
   wives. After Mary realises that Joss is the leader of a band of
   wreckers and even overhears Joss considering the later eventual murder
   by hanging of one of their members, a local clerk who refused to
   participate in other than mere contraband, with a mysterious partner
   who was hiding in one of the inn's bedroom, she is unsure whether to
   trust Jem or not. Meanwhile, Squire Bassat of North Hill, the local
   Magistrate, tries in vain to catch the results of the plunders inside
   the inn he himself indirectly sold to its keeper. She turns to Rev.
   Francis Davey, the albino vicar of the neighbouring village of
   Altarnun, who happened to find Mary travelling by horse when she got
   lost one day on the moor while trying to follow her uncle.

   Mary and Jem leave the moors on a jingle for Christmas Eve and spend a
   day together in the town of Launceston, during which Jem sells a horse
   he stole from Squire Bassat of North Hill back to his unwitting wife.
   With the money earned in other sales, Jem offers Mary a pair of gold
   earrings and a red shawl. He confesses her that he has many "wives" in
   Cornwall. Despite Jem's offer to spend the night together with her at a
   local inn, Mary refuses. When it comes time to return to Jamaica Inn,
   Jem leaves Mary to get the jingle, but never returns. Mary has no
   way to get home except by walking but when she attempts this realises
   the weather and distance make it impossible. At this point Francis
   Davey passes her on the road in a hired coach and offers her a lift
   home. During the voyage, he explains her he has just come from a
   meeting where it was settled that His Majesty's Government is going to
   create a patrol system for the British coasts from the beginning of the
   new year and end with the shipwrecks. He leaves the coach at the
   crossroads to walk to Altarnun. The coach is then waylaid by her
   uncle's band of wreckers and the coach driver is killed. Almost raped
   by Harry when trying to escape back, Mary resists him but is caught,
   forced to go along with the wreckers and has to watch as they 'wreck' -
   tricking a ship into steering itself on to the rocks and then murdering
   the survivors of the shipwreck as they swim ashore - despite her vain
   attempt to warn the ship's crew.

   A few days later, Jem comes to speak with Mary, who is locked in her
   room at the inn. With Jem's help, Mary escapes and goes to Altarnun to
   tell the vicar about Joss's misdeeds but he isn't at home. She leaves
   him a written note and then goes to the squire's home and tells his
   wife her story but Mrs. Bassat tells Mary that her husband already has
   the evidence to arrest Joss and has gone to do so. Mrs. Bassat has her
   driver take Mary to Jamaica Inn, where they arrive before the Squire's
   party. Mary goes inside and finds her uncle stabbed to death; the
   squire and his men arrive soon thereafter and discover Patience
   similarly murdered.

   The vicar arrives at the inn, having received the note Mary left for
   him that afternoon and offers her refuge for the night. The next day,
   Mary finds in his desk drawer a drawing by the vicar; she is shocked to
   see that he has drawn himself as a wolf while the members of his
   congregation have heads of sheep. The vicar returns and tells Mary that
   Jem was the one who informed on Joss. When he realizes that she has
   seen the drawing, the vicar reveals that he was the true head of the
   wrecker gang and direct responsible for the murders of Joss and
   Patience. He then flees the vicarage, taking Mary as his hostage under
   the threat of violence. The vicar explains that he sought enlightenment
   in the Christian Church but did not find it and instead found it in the
   practices of the ancient Druids. As they flee across the moor by horses
   to try to reach a ship to sail to Spain, Squire Bassat and Jem lead a
   search party with dogs that closes the gap, eventually coming close
   enough for Jem to shoot at the vicar, who throws himself down a cliff,
   and rescue Mary.

   Mary has an offer to work as a servant for the Bassats and their two
   children, but instead plans to return to Helford. On her home returning
   day trip, in the beginning of January, as she drives a cart on the
   moor, she comes across Jem, leading a cart with all of his possessions,
   headed in the opposite direction. After some discussion, Mary decides
   to abandon her plans to return to Helford to go with Jem out of
   Cornwall.
