   The game takes place fifteen years after the original game. After
   destroying the Taiidan Emperor and reclaiming their ancient homeworld
   of Hiigara, the Kushan re-establish their clans, or "kiith", in a great
   council, though some clans have precedence over others. The Mothership,
   with Fleet Command and the hyperspace core removed from it, remains in
   orbit over Hiigara as a shipyard. Meanwhile, the Taiidan Empire has
   collapsed after years of civil war, and a new Taiidani Republic has
   arisen as an ally of the newly minted Hiigarans, while the Imperialists
   and their Turanic Raider allies continue to raid both Hiigaran and
   Republic space.

   The campaign begins with the Kuun-Lan, a mining vessel belonging to
   Kiith Somtaaw (one of the minor clans), launching from the dry dock
   orbiting the Angel Moon to assist Kiith Nabaal carrier Veer-Rak and its
   fleet to defend Hiigara against the Imperialists' assault. While aiding
   a Hiigaran destroyer attacked by Turanic Raiders, they soon find a
   derelict beacon pod, which the crew decides to capture and research
   with the aid of the research vessel Clee-San, sent by their clan
   leaders back on Hiigara, who order that the beacon and its technology
   be kept within Kiith Somtaaw in order to gain an advantage over the
   other clans. As they study it aboard the Kuun-Lan, a strange virus
   begins to take over the ship. The part of the ship containing the
   derelict is jettisoned; the Clee-San then scans the jettisoned part of
   the ship to determine what happened. As it scans, the jettisoned
   portion of the ship fires a beam at the Clee-San that subverts control
   of the ship and its escorts. Turanic Raiders arrive and are also
   subverted, forcing the Kuun-Lan to flee.

   Further research suggests that the derelict pod carried techno-organic
   nanobots which they call "the Beast", that can take control of
   machinery and even people. The Kuun-Lan seeks a Bentusi trading ship
   for help, and find it being attacked by a Beast fleet. The trading ship
   is hit with an infection beam and self-destructs to avoid being
   subverted. While other ships are assimilated by the Beast, the Kuun-Lan
   discovers that while the true origins of the Beast are unknown, it was
   first discovered by an alien vessel called the Naggarok, which had come
   from another galaxy a million years earlier and had picked up the Beast
   in intergalactic hyperspace. Before the Naggarok was fully assimilated,
   the drives and communications of the ship were destroyed by the crew,
   but the ship automatically released a distress beacon - still infected
   by the Beast - which the Kuun-Lan discovered. As the Kuun-Lan hunts for
   the Naggarok, they must also contend with the Imperialist Taiidani, who
   are experimenting with the Beast in an attempt to weaponize it.

   Following this, the Kuun-Lan makes contact with a Hiigaran carrier
   known as the Caal-Shto, which takes the majority of the information
   that the Somtaaw have on the Beast so that they could return with
   reinforcements. Unfortunately, the Caal-Shto becomes subverted by
   unknown means and leads the Kuun-Lan into a trap, where the Hiigarans
   have to fend off a massive Beast fleet led by a mothership class
   vessel. This ship was no other than the former research module that
   they jettisoned early in the campaign. It was not only capable of
   communication, but was also seeking their origin point of the Naggarok.
   Despite these setbacks, the Kuun-Lan manages to locate their sister
   ship and finally get vital information to their homeworld, whose
   territories were on the verge of buckling with both attacks from the
   Imperialists and the spreading Beast infestation.

   After several battles with infected vessels and Imperialist planetary
   bases, the Kuun-Lan discovers a siege cannon, which has the potential
   to be an effective weapon against the Beast. The cannon proves
   ineffective against Beast-controlled vessels as-is (it also overheats
   after one shot), so the Kuun-Lan begins searching for the Naggarok so
   they can use a "pure" sample of the Beast to upgrade the cannon. Upon
   encountering the Naggarok, they find that the Imperialists have allied
   with the Beast in return for control of half of the galaxy, seeking
   revenge for what the Hiigarans and the Bentusi had done to their
   Emperor and the collapse of their original rule. They started this by
   repairing the ship's primary systems. The Beast offers the Kuun-Lan a
   chance to join them, an offer that is rejected. The Naggarok, fully
   repaired, then escapes. As the cannon also uses Bentusi technology, the
   Kuun-Lan searches for the mysterious traders who had supported the
   Kushan exiles' claim to Hiigara. However, the Bentusi are panicked by
   the emergence of the Beast, and attempt to flee to another galaxy. The
   Kuun-Lan and its fleet destroy the Bentusi's slipgate and engage their
   tradeships, eventually shaming the Bentusi into helping them fight the
   Beast.

   The Somtaaw fleet soon finds the Clee-San and captures it, using it to
   lure the infected portion of the Kuun-Lan (used by the Beast as a
   mothership) before the ship's reactor overloads; the Kuun-Lan then
   destroys the Beast mothership using the newly enhanced siege cannon.
   They then seek out the Nomad Moon, a Taiidani Republic battle station
   incorporating a powerful repulsor field; upon their arrival, they find
   that the station has already been infected by the Beast. The Naggarok,
   protected by the station's repulsor field, again offers the Kuun-Lan an
   alliance, an offer that is again refused. Acting on information from
   the Republic, the Kuun-Lan is able to destroy the Nomad Moon's repulsor
   field generators using vessels small enough to avoid its sensors,
   allowing the main fleet to destroy the station itself. The Imperialist
   Taiidani, seeing that the Beast did not intend to honor its bargain
   after witnessing the Bentusi appear, abandon the battle, leaving the
   Naggarok to be destroyed by the Somtaaw fleet.

   After the destruction of the Naggarok, the remainder of the
   Beast-infected ships are destroyed and a vaccine to the infection is
   discovered, ensuring that the Beast would never return again. Kiith
   Somtaaw gains great prestige in Hiigaran society, and are honored with
   the title of "Beastslayers" for their prominent role in the destruction
   of the Beast.
