   Flight of the Old Dog is the story of a secret highly modified B-52
   bomber flying into the Soviet Union on an impromptu strike mission.

   The book begins with a B-52 crew during a military exercise in Idaho.
   Not long after, the Americans discover the existence of a Soviet
   ground-based laser in the Kamchatka Peninsula. Although Moscow insists
   that the system does not violate existing strategic accords such as the
   ABM Treaty, their frequent use of the laser in striking vital US assets
   challenges Washington's patience before the UN.

   Meanwhile, Gen. Bradley Elliott, commander of the High Technology
   Aerospace Weapons Center (HAWC; also known as Dreamland), tests a
   unique B-52 bomber with the help of several young crewmembers. Called
   the EB-52 Megafortress (named Old Dog), the plane is being eyed as a
   new strategic escort for SAC forces. The technology tested in the plane
   is later adapted and fitted into two B-1 bombers that are sent to
   attack the Soviet laser after it destroys an American space defense
   satellite.

   The B-1 mission is intercepted by the Soviets, but the aircraft are not
   shot down. At the same time, terrorists attack HAWC, forcing Elliott
   and the Old Dog crew to launch immediately. The crew push ahead with
   the B-1s' mission after they realize that they are the only remaining
   hope for destroying the laser.

   After faking a crash outside Seattle and forcing a KC-10 crew in Shemya
   to refuel them, the Old Dog enters Soviet airspace and engages PVO
   fighters before and after destroying the laser.

   With a number of crew members injured, and the aircraft damaged and
   leaking fuel, the crew realize that they no longer have enough fuel to
   return safely to the United States. They set down at Anadyr, a
   little-used Russian airfield to steal enough fuel for their journey
   home. Surprised in the act of refueling by Soviet forces, one of the
   crew sacrifices himself to allow the plane to take off. Despite
   considerable damage to both crew and aircraft and a final attack by a
   Soviet fighter, the Old Dog is able to make it home safely.
