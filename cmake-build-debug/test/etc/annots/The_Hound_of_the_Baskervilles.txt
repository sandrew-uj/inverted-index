   The titular hound

   Dr James Mortimer calls on Sherlock Holmes in London for advice after
   his friend Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead in the yew alley of
   his manor on Dartmoor in Devon. The death was attributed to a heart
   attack, but according to Mortimer, Sir Charles's face retained an
   expression of horror, and not far from the corpse the footprints of a
   gigantic hound were clearly visible. According to an old legend, a
   curse runs in the Baskerville family since the time of the English
   Civil War, when a Hugo Baskerville abducted and caused the death of a
   maiden on the moor, only to be killed in turn by a huge demonic hound.
   Allegedly the same creature has been haunting the manor ever since,
   causing the premature death of many Baskerville heirs. Sir Charles
   believed in the plague of the hound and so does Mortimer, who now fears
   for the next in line, Sir Henry Baskerville.

   Even though he dismisses the curse story as nonsense, Holmes agrees to
   meet Sir Henry in London as soon as Sir Henry arrives from Canada,
   where he has been living. He is a young and jovial good-looking fellow,
   sceptical toward the grim legend and eager to take possession of
   Baskerville Hall, even though he has just found an anonymous note in
   the mail warning him to stay away from the moor. When someone shadows
   Sir Henry while he is walking down a street, however, Holmes asks
   Watson to go with the young man and Mortimer to Dartmoor, in order to
   protect Sir Henry and search for any clues about who is menacing his
   life.

   The hound killed by Holmes

   The trio arrives at Baskerville Hall, an old and imposing manor in the
   middle of a vast park, managed by a butler and his wife the
   housekeeper. The estate is surrounded by the moor and borders the
   Grimpen Mire, where animals and humans can sink to death in quicksand.
   The news that a convict named Selden, a murderer, has escaped from the
   nearby Dartmoor Prison and is hiding in the nearby hills adds to the
   barren landscape and the gloomy atmosphere.

   There are inexplicable events during the first night, keeping the
   guests awake, and only in the daylight can Watson and Sir Henry relax
   while exploring the neighborhood and meeting the scattered and
   idiosyncratic residents of the district. Watson keeps on searching for
   any lead to the identity of whoever is threatening Sir Henry's life,
   and faithfully sends the details of his investigation to Holmes. Among
   the residents, the Stapletons, brother and sister, stand out: Jack is
   overfriendly and a bit too curious toward the newly arrived, while
   Beryl, a rare beauty, seems all too weary of the place and attempts to
   warn Sir Henry of danger.

   Distant howls and strange sightings trouble Watson during his long
   walks on the hills, and his mood gets no better even inside Baskerville
   Hall. Watson grows suspicious of the butler, Barrymore, who at night
   appears to be signaling from a window of the house with a candle to
   someone on the moor. Meanwhile, Sir Henry is drawn to Beryl, who seems
   to be afraid of her brother's opinion on the matter. To make the puzzle
   even more complex, there is Mortimer, who is all too eager to convince
   Sir Henry that the curse is real; an old and grumpy neighbour, who
   likes to pry with his telescope into other people's doings; his
   daughter Laura, who had unclear ties to Sir Charles; and even a bearded
   man roaming free in the hills and apparently hiding on a tor where
   ancient tombs have been excavated by Mortimer for an unclear purpose.

   Unknown to everyone, even to his friend Watson, Holmes has been hiding
   in the moor all the time and has solved the mystery. He reveals that
   the hound is real and belongs to Stapleton, who seduced Laura and
   convinced her to lure Sir Charles out of his house by night, in order
   to frighten him with the apparition of the legendary hound. Beryl is
   indeed Jack's legitimate wife, abused and forced into posing as his
   sister to seduce Sir Henry and expose him also to the fangs of the
   hound, since Stapleton is in fact a descendant of the Baskervilles
   wanting to claim their inheritance. Meanwhile, the hound attempts to
   kill Sir Henry, but Barrymore had given the former's clothes to Selden,
   his brother-in-law, who dies in his place.

   Unfortunately the collected evidence is not enough for a jury to
   condemn Stapleton, so Holmes decides to use young Baskerville as a bait
   to catch the criminal red-handed. Sir Henry will accept an invitation
   to Stapleton's house and will walk back alone after dark, giving his
   enemy every chance to unleash the hound on him. Holmes and Watson
   pretend to leave Dartmoor by train, but instead they hide near
   Stapleton's house with Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard. Despite the
   dark and a thick fog, Holmes and Watson are able to kill the fearsome
   beast as soon as it attacks the designated victim, while Stapleton, in
   his panicked flight from the scene, drowns in the mire.
