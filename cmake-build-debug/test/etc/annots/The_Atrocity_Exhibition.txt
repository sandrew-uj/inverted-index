   The Atrocity Exhibition is an experimental novel of linked stories or
   "condensed novels" by British writer J. G. Ballard.

   The book was originally published in the UK in 1970 by Jonathan Cape.
   After a 1970 edition by Doubleday & Company had already been printed,
   Nelson Doubleday Jr. personally cancelled the publication and had the
   copies destroyed, fearing legal action from some of the celebrities
   depicted in the book. Thus, the first US edition was published in 1972
   by Grove Press under the title Love and Napalm: Export USA.^[1] It was
   made into a film by Jonathan Weiss in 2000.^[2]^[3]

   A revised large format paperback edition, with annotations by the
   author and illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner, was issued by RE/Search
   in 1990.^[4] The edition with annotations is now standard.

   All of the 1970 book originally appeared as stories in magazines before
   being collected. There is some debate on whether the book is an
   experimental novel with chapters or a collection of linked stories.
   With titles such as "Plans for the Assassination of Jacqueline
   Kennedy," "Love and Napalm: Export USA," and "Why I Want to Fuck Ronald
   Reagan," and by constantly associating the Kennedy assassination with a
   sexual or sporting event, the work has maintained controversy,
   especially in the United States, where some considered it a slur on the
   dead president's image. Ballard claimed that "it was an attempt for me
   to make sense of that tragic event."
