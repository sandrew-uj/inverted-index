   Legends tell of the coming of the dragon-god Derrezen, a monster
   powerful enough to crush all of humanity beneath his claws. The
   forgotten child of Niiran's goddess Ameterra, he has spent centuries in
   an arcane prison. But now he has awakened, driven by hatred and intent
   on recreating the world in his image. Only the combined efforts of two
   powerful wizards have protected the human empire of Blackwood until
   now. But when one of them finally falls in battle, the realm is more
   vulnerable than ever before.

   Kajeel Shadowslayer awakens in the realm of the afterlife, the wounds
   from her final fatal battle with Derrezen still fresh. She must journey
   into her own past to seek a weapon stronger than magic that can finally
   stop the Dragon's rampage. But can even Blackwood's greatest sorceress
   breach the boundaries of death itself?

   Kajeel's husband Garyl stands as the empire's last chance against its
   oldest foe. Cursed long ago for unspeakable crimes, Garyl's
   decades-long search for redemption may be reaching its end. But first
   he must set aside his grief and meet the Dragon head on - a battle that
   he knows he will ultimately lose. The two Shadowslayers must reach
   beyond the borders of life and death, past and present, and ultimately
   must sacrifice that which is most dear to them in order to succeed. The
   final emotional struggle will determine not only the fate of Blackwood,
   but of the entire world of Niiran.
