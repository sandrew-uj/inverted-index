   When Ella was just a baby, the fairy Lucinda bestowed a gift on her.
   Inspired by her crying, the fairy placed the gift of obedience on the
   baby. When Ella is around fourteen, she and her mother are taken ill.
   Ella recovers, because she drinks the soup with unicorns hairs while
   her mother (who takes out the unicorn hairs) dies. Her cook Mandy
   reveals herself to be her Fairy godmother. She is also given two gifts
   by Mandy: a gnome-crafted necklace from her mother and a magic book
   which allows her to see diary entries, letters and fairy tales. At her
   mother's funeral, Ella meets the kingdom's prince, Char, who expresses
   fondness for her mother. At the wake, she is introduced to Dame Olga
   and her terrible daughters, Hattie and Olive.

   Her father, Peter, decides to send her to finishing school with the two
   mean sisters. Before leaving she visits all of her favorite places,
   once again running into Char, who enjoys her company. At the royal
   menagerie, they encounter a Gnome toddler standing too close to the
   Ogre pen. Char saves him in time but hands him to Ella. Ella is then
   ordered by the Ogre to bring the child to him and against her will she
   starts toward the pen. They are only saved when Char commands her to
   stop.

   On the trip to finishing school, Hattie discovers that Ella does
   whatever she is told and uses this for her own gain. Her first act is
   taking Ella's mother's necklace and then depriving Ella of food for the
   next three days. At school, she is constantly ordered and corrected,
   taking solace in her new friend, Areida. When Hattie orders Ella to end
   her friendship with Areida, Ella cannot stand this and sets out to find
   Lucinda so that she can reverse the spell. She learns of a Giant
   wedding and hopes to find her there.

   Ella comes upon the kingdom of Elves, who offer a warm welcome and
   provisions for the journey ahead. The next morning, she awakens
   surrounded by ogres who plan on devouring her. She is given the command
   not to run away, so she is trapped, and stays up all night practicing
   her persuasive Ogrese in hopes of using it on the ogres. It works and
   she talks them back to sleep, just in time for Char and his soldiers to
   show up and apprehend them. The men are impressed with Ella's ability.
   One of his men is sent to escort Ella to the Giant wedding.

   Lucinda unintentionally curses the bride and groom to always be
   together, and two other fairies in attendance give her grief for
   ruining the newlyweds' lives. Ella then learns that ungrateful
   recipients of her gifts often end up as squirrels and decides to use an
   alias when talking to her. Ella tells her she desires more mettle for
   she is too obedient, but Lucinda tells Ella to "be happy to be blessed
   with such a lovely quality" and Ella is forced to feel happy because of
   her 'gift.'

   During the carriage ride home with her father, Ella learns that he's
   lost everything and she's going to have to be married off. She is
   introduced to a much older duke but her father determines that the duke
   is too poor to marry her and he hasn't the time to find her another
   suitor, so he instead must marry Dame Olga.

   At the wedding of Peter and Olga, Lucinda is in attendance and gifts
   the bride and groom with eternal love. After the wedding, Ella sneaks
   away so as not to be seen by Lucinda, but is then found by Char. The
   two of them wander through the old castle looking for a secret passage.
   Their search coming up dry, they settle in an indoor garden. They find
   glass slippers on an old bench, Char gets Ella to put them on and they
   dance. They then discuss him leaving on a year-long trip before
   deciding they better get going.

   On the ride to Olga's house, Peter reveals to her that he's broke. Olga
   is livid, but due to Lucinda's gift, she is unable to stay angry at
   him. Instead she begins to transfer all of her hatred to Ella. Char
   comes to visit Ella the next day, but Hattie orders her to stay in her
   room. This continues until Char leaves for his trip. They start
   communicating via letters, which Ella has him address to Mandy so as
   not to arouse suspicion from her new step-family. When Peter leaves for
   work, Hattie reveals Ella's curse and Olga makes Ella work as a servant
   in her house.

   After months of communicating with each other, Ella falls in love with
   Char but is uncertain of his feelings. Char professes his love for her
   and wishes for her to be his queen. Ella's excitement is short-lived
   when she realizes her curse could be used against him and be very
   dangerous for him since he will one day be king. She decides they could
   never be together and writes a letter addressed from Hattie to mislead
   him into thinking she has run off with a rich earl. Mandy hates to see
   Ella so hurt and calls upon Lucinda to tell her to undo the gift of
   obedience in exchange for transforming her into a squirrel for three
   months.

   During the next six months, Ella continues to endure the torment of her
   step-family, as well as writing letters for Char. She learns that Char
   will be returning soon and three royal balls will be held. Lucinda
   comes back feeling horribly for Ella but is not able to lift the spell
   off of her. Lucinda tells her she can only do it herself, but she'll
   come to provide aid if summoned.

   When Prince Char returns from his travels, Ella goes to the balls in
   disguise, with the help of Mandy and Lucinda. At the first ball, she
   dances with Char, who still wants to be with Ella after a chance
   meeting with Areida made him question the letter he received. On the
   second night, Char begs her to come the following night to see him
   perform a song. On the third night, he introduces her to his parents
   and dances only with her. Hattie is jealous and unmasks Ella, causing
   her to flee and lose one of her glass slippers. Char finds the slipper
   and goes to her home. He asks her to tell him if she loves him, which
   she does. He then tells her to marry him and she accepts. Hattie orders
   her not to, she says she can't, then Olga realizes with her curse and
   being queen, they could have anything and everything, and demands she
   marry Char. Still concerned for the safety of Char and the kingdom,
   Ella finds the strength to refuse her command, thus breaking Lucinda's
   spell. Now Ella is able to marry Char on her own accord and she happily
   accepts. Ella and Areida reconnect. Mandy becomes the castle cook and
   fairy godmother to Char and Ella's future children. Ella and Char live
   happily ever after.
