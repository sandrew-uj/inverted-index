   The Prelude to Dune series begins four decades before the events of
   Dune, with an eager Crown Prince Shaddam plotting to succeed his aging
   father Elrood IX, young House Atreides heir Leto becoming close with
   the ruling family of the important technology world Ix, and the Bene
   Gesserit scheming behind the scenes to create the Kwisatz Haderach. As
   the series progresses, Leto becomes the new Atreides Duke, the Shaddam
   becomes emperor and aligns with the Bene Tleilax in their takeover of
   Ix to develop synthetic spice, and the Bene Gesserit punish Baron
   Vladimir Harkonnen for raping one of them with a disease that slows his
   metabolism. The Spacing Guild, having found the Tleilaxu synthetic
   spice to be fatal to its Navigators, forces Shaddam to capitulate to
   the Landsraad, with Leto playing a role in forcing Shaddam to sign
   humiliating peace accords, confirming his status as the emperor's
   leading rival.
