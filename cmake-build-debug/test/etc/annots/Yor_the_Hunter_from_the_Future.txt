   Yor, a roving hunter and barbarian, jogs through a seemingly
   prehistoric desert landscape, past the stone towers of Cappadocia,
   Turkey. In a nearby village, Kala, a seemingly primitive cavewoman, and
   her mentor and protector Pag are hunting. They were hunting a small
   pig-like Polacanthus. Suddenly, they are attacked by a "stegoceratops",
   (a amalgam of a Stegosaurus and a Triceratops). Yor appears and kills
   the dinosaur with his axe, drinking some of its blood immediately
   afterwards. Yor is befriended by the village, and together, the
   villagers cut the choice meats to be feasted upon in celebration.

   While Yor rests, a band of cavemen with bluish skin attack the village.
   Only Yor and Pag escape. Yor immediately swears to get Kala back. Yor
   and Pag track the blue cavemen to their lair, where Yor shoots a giant
   bat with his bow and arrow. He uses the dead bat like a hang glider to
   storm the lair and starts flooding sections of the cave, the diversion
   helping his escape out the back with Kala. The flood kills everyone
   inside the cave, including the other kidnapped villagers (who had been
   locked in cages) as well as the blue cavemen.

   Kala and Pag decide to follow Yor in his adventure to find his origins.
   Along the way, they find a mysterious society of sand mummies led by a
   blonde woman named Roah with an amulet similar to Yor's own. Yor
   proceeds to kill everyone except Roah, deciding that she will be
   important for their journey. Kala tries to kill Roah at one point, but
   they are both suddenly attacked by more blue cavemen. Yor and Pag come
   to the rescue, but a caveman strikes Roah down from behind and she dies
   in Yor's arms.

   Yor, Pag, and Kala make friends with another tribe after saving some
   children from a dimetrodon, but this tribe is killed by (unseen) flying
   saucers shooting lasers. Yor and company use a boat to make their way
   to an island surrounded by storms. There Yor discovers, to his initial
   disbelief, that his parents were from a small band of nuclear holocaust
   survivors, thereby revealing the "twist" that Yor's world is actually
   post-apocalyptic Earth after a nuclear holocaust. A ruthless tyrant
   called the Overlord has taken control of the remaining nuclear
   technology with his android army.

   Yor finds allies in a group of rebels led by the scientist, Ena and the
   mysterious blind Elder, who have been plotting to overthrow the
   Overlord for years. Yor and the rebels join forces and attack the
   Overlord and his androids. Ena leads them to the fortress's atomic
   stockpile, where they plant explosives powerful enough to destroy it
   and the fortress. The Elder remains behind and slowly deactivates the
   android army, buying time for the others to escape. The Overlord
   pursues them in an attempt to stop the stockpile's destruction and
   briefly engages Yor in combat, overwhelming him temporarily. As the
   Overlord enters a nearby elevator, Yor grabs a nearby pole and hurls it
   through the window, impaling the villain. Mortally wounded, the
   Overlord struggles onward toward the stockpile as Yor and Ena continue
   to lead the others to safety. Pag orders them to keep going while he
   fends off the androids, but he loses his weapon and ends up getting
   cornered by them. Ena and the rebels quickly rush to his aid, but just
   as the androids are about to kill Pag, the Elder deactivates them as
   well. The group quickly boards one of the Overlord's ships just as the
   Overlord himself reaches the stockpile control room. But before he can
   stop the bomb, it explodes and he succumbs to his injuries and slowly
   dies. At the same moment, the Overlord's spacecraft, carrying Yor,
   Kala, Pag and the rebels flies out of the hangar to safety, while the
   Overlord's facility explodes behind them. As the movie ends and the
   ship flies off into the distance, the narrator intones: "...Yor returns
   to the primitive tribes on the mainland. He is determined to use his
   superior knowledge to prevent them making the same mistakes as their
   forefathers. Will he succeed?"
