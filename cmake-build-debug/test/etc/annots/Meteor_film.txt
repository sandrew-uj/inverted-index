   After the asteroid Orpheus in the Asteroid Belt is hit by a comet,
   dozens of asteroid fragments are sent on a collision course towards
   Earth, along with a five-mile fragment which will cause an
   extinction-level event. While the United States government engages in
   political maneuvering, the smaller asteroid fragments preceding the
   main body wreak havoc on the planet, revealing the threat. The United
   States has a secret orbiting nuclear missile platform satellite named
   Hercules, which was designed by Dr. Paul Bradley (Sean Connery). It was
   intended to defend Earth against a threat like Orpheus, but instead was
   commandeered by the U.S. Military to become an orbiting weapon now
   aimed at the Soviet Union. After many calculations, it is determined
   that the fourteen nuclear missiles on board Hercules are not enough to
   stop the meteorite.

   The United States has known that the Soviet Union also has a similar
   weapons satellite called Peter the Great in orbit, with its sixteen
   nuclear warheads pointed down at that country. Needing the additional
   firepower to stop Orpheus, the President (Henry Fonda) goes on national
   television and reveals the existence of Hercules, explaining it was
   created to meet the threat that Orpheus represents. He also offers the
   Soviets a chance to save face by announcing they, too, had the same
   program and their own satellite weapon. To coordinate the
   counter-effort between the two countries, Bradley requests a Soviet
   scientist named Dr. Alexei Dubov (Brian Keith).

   Bradley and Harry Sherwood (Karl Malden) of NASA meet at the control
   center for Hercules, located beneath 195 Broadway in Lower Manhattan.
   Major General Adlon (Martin Landau) is the commander of the facility.
   Dubov and his interpreter Tatiana Donskaya (Natalie Wood) arrive, and
   Bradley gets to work on breaking the ice between them. Since Dubov
   cannot admit the existence of the Soviet device, he agrees to Bradley's
   proposal that they work on the "theoretical application" of how a
   "theoretical" Soviet space platform's weapons would be coordinated with
   the American platform.

   Meanwhile, more meteorite fragments strike Earth (one inside Siberia),
   and the Soviets finally agree to join in the effort. Both satellites
   are coordinated, and turned towards the incoming large asteroid as
   smaller fragments continue to strike the planet, causing great damage,
   including a deadly avalanche in the Swiss Alps and a tsunami which
   devastates Hong Kong. With hours remaining prior to Orpheus' impact, as
   planned, Peter the Great's missiles are launched first because of its
   relative position to the asteroid, with Hercules's missiles timed to be
   fired 40 minutes later.

   Immediately prior to Hercules's missiles being launched, a splinter
   fragment is discovered to be heading towards the command center in New
   York City. If the center is destroyed, Hercules will not be able to
   launch. With seconds to spare, Hercules receives the signal to fire
   from the command center, and launches its missiles. The splinter
   impacts the city, destroying the top half of the World Trade Center
   twin towers in a direct hit, and creating a large crater in Central
   Park. Several workers inside the control center are killed when the
   facility is partially destroyed by the collapse of the building above,
   and the survivors slowly work their way out of the control center by
   going through the New York subway system, which has become a trap due
   to water from the East River flooding the tunnels. Meanwhile, the two
   flights of missiles link up into three successively larger waves. The
   Hercules crew reaches a crowded subway station and waits while others
   try to dig them out.

   Eventually, the missiles reach the meteoroid. The first wave of
   missiles strikes the rock, causing a small explosion, the second wave
   follows with a larger blast, and the third wave creates an enormous
   explosion. When the dust clears, the asteroid appears obliterated. In
   New York City, the radios broadcast the good news: Orpheus is no longer
   a danger to Earth. Just then, the subway station occupants are rescued.

   Later, at an airport, Dubov, Tatiana, Bradley and others exchange
   goodbyes before Dubov and Tatiana depart on a plane for the Soviet
   Union.
