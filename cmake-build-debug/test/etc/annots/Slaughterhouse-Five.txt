   The story is told in a non-linear order, and events become clear
   through flashbacks and time travel experiences from the unreliable
   narrator, who begins the novel by writing "All of this happened, more
   or less." The narrator spends the first chapter describing his
   writing of the book, his experiences as a University of Chicago
   anthropology student and a Chicago City News Bureau correspondent, his
   research on the Children's Crusade and the history of Dresden, and his
   visit to Cold War-era Europe with his war friend Bernard V. O'Hare. He
   writes about Billy Pilgrim, an American man from the fictional town of
   Ilium, New York, who believes he was held in an alien zoo on the
   fictional planet of Tralfamadore and has experienced time travel.

   As a chaplain's assistant in the United States Army during World War
   II, Billy is an ill-trained, disoriented, and fatalistic American
   soldier who finds he does not like war and refuses to fight. He is
   transferred from a base in South Carolina to the front line in
   Luxembourg during the Battle of the Bulge. He is captured in 1944 by
   the Germans. Billy nearly dies due to a string of events. Before he is
   captured, he meets Roland Weary, a patriot, warmonger, and sadistic
   bully who derides Billy's cowardice. When the two are captured, the
   Germans confiscate everything Weary has and force him to wear painful
   wooden clogs. Weary eventually succumbs to gangrene caused by wounds
   from the stiff clogs. While dying in a rail car full of prisoners,
   Weary convinces fellow soldier Paul Lazzaro that Billy is to blame for
   his death. Lazzaro vows to avenge Weary's death by killing Billy,
   because revenge is "the sweetest thing in life".

   At this exact time, Billy becomes "un-un-unstuck in time" and has
   flashbacks from his former and future life. Billy and the other
   prisoners are transported into Germany. By 1945, the prisoners have
   arrived in the German city of Dresden to work in "contract labor"
   (forced labor). The Germans hold Billy and his fellow prisoners in an
   empty slaughterhouse called Schlachthof-fuenf ("slaughterhouse five").
   During the extensive bombing of Dresden by the Allies, German guards
   hide with the prisoners in the slaughterhouse, which is partially
   underground and well-protected from the damage on the surface. As a
   result, they are among the few survivors of the firestorm that rages in
   the city between February 13 and 15, 1945. After V-E Day in May 1945,
   Billy is transferred to the United States and receives his honorable
   discharge in July 1945.

   Soon, Billy is hospitalized with symptoms similar to post-traumatic
   stress disorder and placed under psychiatric care at a Veterans Affairs
   hospital in Lake Placid. There, he shares a room with Eliot Rosewater,
   who introduces Billy to the novels of the obscure science fiction
   author Kilgore Trout. After his release, Billy marries Valencia Merble,
   whose father owns the Ilium School of Optometry that Billy later
   attends. Billy becomes a successful and wealthy optometrist. In 1947,
   Billy and Valencia conceive their first child Robert on their honeymoon
   in Cape Ann, Massachusetts, and two years later their daughter Barbara
   is born. On Barbara's wedding night, Billy is abducted by a flying
   saucer and taken to a planet many light-years away from Earth called
   Tralfamadore. The Tralfamadorians are described as being able to see in
   four dimensions, simultaneously observing all points in the space-time
   continuum. They universally adopt a fatalistic worldview: death means
   nothing to them, and their common response to hearing about death is
   "so it goes".

   On Tralfamadore, Billy is put in a transparent geodesic dome exhibit in
   a zoo; the dome represents a house on Earth. The Tralfamadorians later
   abduct a pornographic film star named Montana Wildhack, who had
   disappeared on Earth and was believed to have drowned herself in San
   Pedro Bay. They intend to have her mate with Billy. She and Billy fall
   in love and have a child together. Billy is instantaneously sent back
   to Earth in a time warp to relive past or future moments of his life.

   In 1968, Billy and a co-pilot are the only survivors of a plane crash
   in Vermont. While driving to visit Billy in the hospital, Valencia
   crashes her car and dies of carbon monoxide poisoning. Billy shares a
   hospital room with Bertram Rumfoord, a Harvard University history
   professor researching an official history of the war. They discuss the
   bombing of Dresden, which the professor initially refuses to believe
   Billy witnessed; the professor claims that the bombing of Dresden was
   justified despite the great loss of civilian lives and the complete
   destruction of the city.

   Billy's daughter takes him home to Ilium. He escapes and flees to New
   York City. In Times Square he visits a pornographic book store, where
   he discovers books written by Kilgore Trout and reads them. Among the
   books he discovers a book entitled The Broad Board, about a couple
   abducted by aliens and tricked into managing the aliens' investments on
   Earth. He also finds a number of magazine covers noting the
   disappearance of Montana Wildhack, who happens to be featured in a
   pornographic film being shown in the store. Later in the evening, when
   he discusses his time travels to Tralfamadore on a radio talk show, he
   is evicted from the studio. He returns to his hotel room, falls asleep,
   and time-travels back to 1945 in Dresden. Billy and his fellow
   prisoners are tasked with locating and burying the dead. After a Maori
   New Zealand soldier working with Billy dies of dry heaves the Germans
   begin cremating the bodies en masse with flamethrowers. Billy's friend
   Edgar Derby is shot for stealing a teapot. Eventually all of the German
   soldiers leave to fight on the Eastern Front, leaving Billy and the
   other prisoners alone with tweeting birds as the war ends.

   Due to the non-chronological storytelling, other parts of Billy's life
   are told throughout the book. After Billy is evicted from the radio
   studio, Barbara treats Billy as a child and often monitors him. Robert
   becomes starkly anti-Communist and a Green Beret in the Vietnam War.
   Billy eventually dies in 1976, in which the United States has been
   partitioned into twenty separate countries and attacked by China with
   thermonuclear weapons. He gives a speech in a baseball stadium in
   Chicago in which he predicts his own death and proclaims that "if you
   think death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word
   I've said." Billy is soon after shot with a laser gun by an assassin
   commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.
