   Tancred Palmieri is a 20-something year old professional thief living
   in Toronto. Over the course of several years he meets and befriends
   Willow Azarian, a drug addict who eventually confesses to him that she
   is the heiress of a billionaire businessman. Upon his death Willow's
   father bequeathed roughly a billion dollars to her and her four other
   siblings, however Willow also believes that there is even more of the
   family fortune left behind. She bases this belief on several bizarre
   mementos her father also left to each of the siblings. Willow cannot
   persuade her other siblings to join her in this belief so she asks
   Tancred to steal the mementos so that she will be able to privately
   examine them to find the location of the hidden money. To convince
   Tancred that she is not crazy Willow shows him her memento: a replica
   of Willows by the Uji Bridge with one panel removed and a small plaque
   on which the words salix babylonica are inscribed. Tancred agrees to
   take the job from Willow, but after she rents him an apartment and pays
   him for the job she dies of pneumonia.

   Tancred begins to steal the mementos belonging to the other Azarian
   siblings. Unfortunately for him, some of the siblings go to the police
   and detective Daniel Mandelshtam who is Tancred's best friend since
   childhood, is assigned to the case.

   At the same time several other people are involved in the hunt.
   Willow's former drug dealer Errol Colby, who Willow had told of her
   theory, also clumsily tries to partner with Tancred to find the
   supposed fortune. The artist who designed four of the pieces, Alexander
   von Wuerfel also becomes interested in the case after Willow, and later
   detective Mandelshtam, visit him to inquire about the nature of the
   pieces. He eventually makes contact with Tancred who offers him 10% of
   whatever Willow's share was in order to convince him to let him see
   replicas of the siblings pieces which von Wuerfel has recreated to help
   him figure out the mystery.

   As Tancred continues to steal the Azarians mementos he comes into
   contact with a few of them, all of whom reveal to Tancred that the
   clues are easily solvable and lead to a mausoleum in a cemetery
   dedicated to the Weiden's a close knit family whom their father had
   always wanted them to emulate. Despite this clue, Tancred continues
   with his quest.

   Tancred eventually realizes that a clue in Willow's memento seems to
   hint that he should be looking for the hidden name Harfen (German for
   Harp) among the Weiden's in the mausoleum. He is successful and finds
   an envelope and key with instructions to a bank in Montreux. Before he
   goes he leads Errol and his associate Freud, to the mausoleum letting
   them find the secret drawer where he has left instructions to the Bank
   of Canada where he has left several precious gems he has stolen. He
   allows Errol and Freud to "steal" the bank information from him. Before
   he leaves for Montreux however, Errol is arrested as he went directly
   to a jeweler who quickly ascertained the gems had been stolen. In
   revenge Freud tries to shoot Trancred who attacks him in a surge of
   adrenaline resulting in Freud falling down a flight of stairs and
   breaking his neck. Tancred feels deep remorse for this action.
   Nevertheless he heads to Montreux where he discovers that Willow's
   father had indeed left each sibling an additional 100 million dollars.
   In a letter he tells Willow to distribute the money as she sees fit.
   For awhile Tancred is unsure what to do, however he ultimately decides
   to return to Toronto, disclose everything to his friend Daniel
   Mandelshtam, give the siblings their share of the money, and fight back
   if they try to prevent him from claiming Willow's share as she had
   ultimately bequeathed it to him.
