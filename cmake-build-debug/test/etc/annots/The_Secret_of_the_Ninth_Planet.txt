   Helping his father on an archeological expedition in the Peruvian
   Andes, Burl Denning looks forward to studying engineering when he
   enters college in the fall. The expedition's study of Inca ruins is
   interrupted by the arrival of a small guided missile from California.
   Inside the missile they find a message informing them that over the
   past several days the Sun's light has dimmed all over the world,
   threatening the onset of a new ice age, and that the source of the
   dimming has been traced to a point seven miles from their camp.

   Burl and his father hike to the location they were given and come to a
   dome surrounded by a wall. Inside the dome they find alien machinery
   that will not respond to their manipulations of the controls. Burl
   tries to pick up a small sphere and it blasts him with what feels like
   an electric shock. He then discovers that the controls will respond to
   him, so he shuts down the installation and sees immediately that the
   sunlight outside the dome has returned to normal.

   Picked up by the military and taken to California, the Dennings are
   told that astronomers have detected a dimming of sunlight on Mercury
   and Mars and suspect it's occurring on the other planets as well.
   Worse, calculations show that if the Sun-stealers' program continues,
   the Sun will blow up as a nova in two to three years. Fortunately the
   means to solve the problem stands readily at hand for those who dare to
   use it - a giant spaceship propelled by an experimental antigravity
   drive.

   Burl is told that, unlike Cavorite, which H.G. Wells described in his
   1901 novel First Men in the Moon, the drive on A-G 17 (also called
   Magellan) is an active device, requiring thermonuclear reactors to
   provide the necessary power. The drive can produce attraction as well
   as attraction of gravitational fields and it can concentrate the force,
   enabling the ship to produce tremendous accelerations. With Burl on
   board, the crew takes the ship into space and grabs the Sun's
   gravitational field to pull the ship onto a trajectory that will take
   it to Venus.

   An error in their understanding of the A-G drive leads them to shoot
   past Venus, so they go to Mercury instead. There, protected by
   parasols, the wrecking crew invades the Sun-tap station and Burl shuts
   it down. An alarm flashes and some time later, just as the men have
   finished photographing the station, the station destroys itself, saving
   the Earthmen the need to bomb it. They then head out to Venus.

   They find the Sun-tap station on Venus sitting on a wide mudbar in the
   middle of a shallow, planet-wide ocean. Inside the station Burl shuts
   down the alarm and then shuts down the station. Then he and his two
   companions must fight their way past a large, flesh-eating amoeba on
   their way to the helicopter that will take them back to Magellan.

   Mars is their next stop. While they pass close to Earth they learn that
   the Sun-tap transmissions have been traced and they point to Pluto as
   their destination. On Mars the men discover that the Sun-tap station
   has been built underneath a Martian city. Again Burl shuts down the
   alarm and then the station as the other men on his team take pictures
   and set a tactical atomic bomb to destroy the place. On their way out
   Boulton fires his gun at what looks like another alarm and is hit by a
   bolt of electricity. Fighting their way through a mob of the ant-like
   Martians, they return to Magellan and set course for Jupiter.

   On the way Boulton tries to sabotage the ship, but when Burl grapples
   with him in an effort to stop him both men are knocked out by a flash
   of light. When they regain consciousness they find that Boulton is back
   to normal, the electric contact with Burl having freed him from the
   alien compulsion.

   The Jovian Sun-tap station sits on Callisto. Burl shuts it down and he
   and his two companions leave immediately, barely escaping the explosion
   of the booby-trapped station destroying itself.

   Partway to Saturn they encounter a Plutonian ship, a dumbbell shaped,
   globe-and-rod craft that launches what looks like a lightning bolt at
   Magellan. The bolt is absorbed by the bazooka rocket that the men had
   already launched at the alien ship. A tactical atomic bomb on a rocket
   obliterates half of the Plutonian ship, which flees.

   At Saturn they find the Sun-tap station on Iapetus and, wary of booby
   traps, drop an H-bomb on it. At Uranus the Sun-tap station sits on
   Oberon and again they wipe it out with a bomb. Then they head toward
   Pluto, figuring that they will hit the Sun-tap station at Neptune on
   their way home. They soon overtake the half-ruined Plutonian ship,
   which hits Magellan with an energy bolt that nearly cripples the ship,
   but then Burl obliterates the alien completely with an atomic blast.

   Arriving at Pluto, an Earth-sized world, the Earthmen discover the last
   Plutonian city at the north pole with two dumbbell ships hovering over
   it. They put Magellan into a low equatorial orbit to avoid being
   spotted while they finish repairing the ship.

   Burl and two companions go down to the surface to explore, working
   their way north and landing their small rocketship several times to
   examine a dead Plutonian city. Finally they come to within a mile of
   the planet's last stronghold. They infiltrate the place, set out a
   small atomic bomb with its timer set for four hours, and try to leave.
   Discovered and chased by Plutonians, Burl is trapped and knocked out.

   He regains consciousness in a transparent enclosure on the surface of
   Triton, just outside the main temple of the Plutonians' lunar religion.
   He finds the controls and frees himself, then he joins a ragtag band of
   Neptunians while Magellan lures the two dumbbell ships out into space
   where the crew destroys them both. Inside the temple Burl finds the
   inner sanctum lined with glass cases containing aliens, including one
   of his companions, in suspended animation, waiting to be sacrificed.
   Burl battles the priests and smashes the cases in a desperate fight. As
   each alien regains consciousness it joins the fight and soon there are
   no more Plutonians.

   With all of the Plutonians dead, the danger to the Solar System is
   past. Burl sees then the people of other planets and of other stars
   coming together in peace and mutual understanding.
