   In 1999, a war between the Pan-American Confederacy and the Eurac
   Monarchy (comprising Europe, Africa, and Asia) resulted in a nuclear
   holocaust. 20 years later, radiation has rendered all remaining humans
   sterile, and the victorious Euracs have occupied Manhattan and hunt
   survivors for genetic experiments.

   After winning a motorized deathmatch in Nevada, an ex-Confederate
   soldier named Parsifal is abducted and taken to the Confederacy's
   secret base in Alaska. The President of the Confederacy tells him there
   is a fertile woman somewhere in New York City. He offers Parsifal a
   place on a Confederate rocketship bound for Alpha Centauri if he can
   infiltrate the city and retrieve her; otherwise, he will be killed.
   When Parsifal proposes sending in a cyborg instead, the President
   reveals the Confederacy eliminated all its cyborgs.

   Parsifal is accompanied by two Confederate agents, Bronx and Ratchet.
   After entering Manhattan through the sewers, they are attacked by the
   Harlem Hunters, a street gang. They escape and come upon the Needle
   People, a group of scavengers led by the Rat Eater King, preparing to
   kill a dwarf named Shorty. Parsifal intervenes, and the three agents
   are captured. Eurac troops raid the scavengers' hideout and bring
   Parsifal, Bronx, and Ratchet to their base along with a scavenger girl,
   Giara.

   Parsifal escapes and rescues Bronx and Giara. Bronx stays behind and is
   killed, while Parsifal and Giara are saved by Ratchet. The three escape
   into the sewers and find refuge in a subterranean dwarf colony with
   Shorty, who claims to know the location of the fertile woman. The
   colony is attacked by Euracs using sonic weapons, and Parsifal, Giara,
   Ratchet, and Shorty flee. They are saved by a group of ape-like
   mutants, led by Big Ape. When Parsifal explains their mission, Big Ape
   reveals he is also fertile. That night, Parsifal protects Giara from
   one of Big Ape's mutants, and they have sex.

   Shorty leads them to an underground vault, where they find a deceased
   professor and a life support chamber containing Melissa, the
   professor's daughter, who entered hibernation before the bombs fell and
   thus remained fertile. They also find a station wagon to escape through
   the Lincoln Tunnel. Big Ape and Giara stay with Melissa while Shorty,
   Parsifal, and Ratchet leave to find armor plating for the car. Big Ape
   then knocks Giara unconscious and impregnates Melissa.

   At a junkyard, Shorty distracts the Euracs and sacrifices himself to
   buy Parsifal and Ratchet time to salvage. They return, collect Melissa,
   and drive through a cave wall into the tunnel. Parsifal manages to
   navigate the armored car past several minefields and barricades to
   freedom, but Big Ape is killed by a laser trap. While driving through
   the desert to their rendezvous, Parsifal deduces that Ratchet is
   actually a cyborg. Ratchet attacks him and stabs Giara before Parsifal
   kills him. Giara begs Parsifal ensure humanity's survival as she dies
   in his arms.

   Back at the Confederacy's headquarters, the President reveals that he
   is terminally ill, and gives Parsifal his place on the rocketship,
   which is revealed to be the base itself. As the ship blasts off,
   Parsifal watches Melissa finally awaken.
