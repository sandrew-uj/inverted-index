   When the wife of Golden Walter betrays him for another man, he leaves
   home on a trading voyage to avoid the necessity of a feud with her
   family. However, his efforts are fruitless, as word comes to him en
   route that his wife's clan has killed his father. As a storm then
   carries him to a faraway country, the effect of this news is merely to
   sunder his last ties to his homeland. Walter comes to the castle of an
   enchantress, from which he rescues a captive maiden in a harrowing
   adventure (or rather, she rescues him). They flee through a region
   inhabited by mini-giants, and eventually reach the city of Stark-wall,
   whose custom, when the throne is vacant, is to take the next foreigner
   to arrive as ruler. The late king having died, Walter and his new love
   are hailed as the new monarchs. The two are married and presumably live
   happily ever after.
