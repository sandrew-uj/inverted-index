   The 1915 American film The Poet of the Peaks was based upon the
   poem.

   The 2009 stop-action animated fantasy film Coraline directed by Henry
   Selick refers to the malevolent Other Mother as "beldam". The film
   includes a similar theme of entrapment by a seemingly beautiful loving
   woman.
