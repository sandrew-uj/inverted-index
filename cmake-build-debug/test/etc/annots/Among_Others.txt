   The novel is presented as the diary of Morgana, a 15-year-old Welsh
   science fiction and fantasy fan, in 1979 and 1980. She and her twin
   sister Morwenna, both frequently using the nicknames "Mor" or "Mori",
   grew up playing and occasionally working magic with beings they call
   faeries in the hills of Wales. Several months before the start of the
   novel, their mother, who is described as both insane and a witch,
   attempts to gain more power to take over the world. The sisters are
   able to stop her, but in the process their mother causes them to be
   struck by a car, killing Morwenna and disabling one of Morgana's legs.
   Morgana begins mostly using Morwenna's name, though still typically
   going by Mori.

   As her mother is insane and her grandfather (with whom she previously
   lived) has a stroke and is in a care facility, she has run away from
   her home and been sent to western England to live with her father and
   his three half-sisters, none of whom she has ever seen. Bereft of her
   sister, her joy in running, and her beloved Welsh countryside, Mori
   must reconcile to her new life as a disabled, friendless outsider. She
   feels that she can do this as long as she has books to read, and her
   one connection to her father is the love of books they share.

   Her paternal family send her to a nearby girls' boarding school, which
   she finds unmagical and very uncongenial. She has few friends and
   considerable free time because she can do her schoolwork quickly and
   because her injury prevents her from participating in sports. She
   spends most of her time reading books provided by her father (also an
   SF fan), the school library, the local public library, and interlibrary
   loan. Throughout her diary she records her and other characters'
   reactions to these books with as much interest as any other events of
   her life. At one point she casts a spell to locate friends who can
   unite with her on a common purpose and then is invited to join a
   SF/fantasy readers' club at the library. She makes a few connections
   there and eventually a boyfriend who not only shares her interested in
   books but in magic, although he can barely see the fairies and cannot
   himself work spells.

   Magic remains a persistent feature in Mori's life. Shortly after her
   arrival at the school, Mori's mother begins sending her letters and
   family photographs in which Mori's image is burned out and launching
   magical attacks to control her daughter. Mori tries to work with the
   fairies near her school but finds she must return to her home in Wales
   to truly connect and do her own protective magic. She is offered the
   opportunity to join her dead sister in becoming a fairy herself, but to
   do so must also die. She chooses instead to embrace her new life and
   whatever the future might hold. She confronts her mother in a final
   magical conflict, and, victorious, returns to her new family and her
   boyfriend.
