   Necromancer follows the fortunes of Paul Formain, a mining engineer in
   the late 21st Century who endures several accidents. His quest for
   self-discovery, and recovery from losing his arm, leads him to embrace
   the Chantry Guild. The Guild embraces a philosophy of destruction with
   the hope of making space for the rise of a new evolutionary form of
   humanity. The instruments in their goals are the Alternate Laws or
   Alternate Forces.

   Formain is led to the Chantry Guild after encountering Destruct, a book
   written by Walter Blunt, the Guild's leader. Formain enlists under the
   mastery of Necromancer Jason Warren and the ethereal influence of
   musical vocalist Kantele Maki. His initial goal in joining the guild is
   the regeneration of his lost arm.

   The story is punctuated by Formain's epiphany moments. First, he
   realizes the inadequacy of psychology in his self exploration. He
   slowly realizes his own savant power over the Alternative Forces. He is
   taken aback by his growing hyper awareness of the world around him,
   specifically the inter-related isolation of all individuals. This
   isolation is dramatically symbolized by Formain's own singularity. He
   has a final epiphany near the end of the book that clarifies for him
   his own identity and potential ... and much more.

   The book is divided into three sub-books: Isolate, Set, and Pattern. In
   each book, Formain realizes the function of each mathematical
   collective in the flow of objective history and subjective reality. As
   with many science fiction novels, the philosophical underpinnings of
   evolution require a decidedly unscientific leap in the reader's
   understanding of what constitutes science to rally the punctuation that
   brings about the next stage of human evolution.
