   Five years ago, a massive explosion released high concentrations of
   nanites into the atmosphere, infecting almost every living thing on
   Earth. These nanites may randomly activate inside their hosts, mutating
   the subject into a monster known as an E.V.O. (short for "Exponentially
   Variegated Organism"). Though some E.V.O.s retain human-level sanity,
   intelligence, and memory and are in full control of their special
   E.V.O. abilities, most transform into monster-like creatures and go
   violently berserk, causing widespread chaos and destruction. An
   international military-style organization known as Providence exists to
   combat the E.V.O. threat.

   Rex is a fifteen-year-old (sixteen, later on in the series) amnesiac
   teenager who is a permanent E.V.O. Unlike most E.V.O.s, he lacks any
   physical deformation but has forgotten his past. He is also able to
   control his active nanites, allowing him to manifest from his body a
   wide variety of various bio-mechanical abilities and powers. Rex has
   the unique ability to deactivate nanites inside other E.V.O.s,
   effectively curing them of their monstrous mutations and returning them
   to normal. Working for Providence under Agent Six, and White Knight,
   Rex uses his unique abilities to stop and cure rampant E.V.O.s. His
   archenemy, Van Kleiss, is an E.V.O. scientist who despises Providence
   and is connected to the original nanite explosion (which is noted as
   simply "The Nanite Event" throughout the series). His ultimate goal is
   to be all powerful, using EVOs to get him there, he promises to tell
   Rex about his past if he will join him.
