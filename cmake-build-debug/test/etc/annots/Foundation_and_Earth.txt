   Several centuries after the events of Second Foundation, two citizens
   of the Foundation search for Earth, the legendary planet where humans
   are said to have originated. Even less is known about Earth than was
   the case in Foundation, when scholars still seem to know the location
   of 'Sol'.

   The story follows on from Foundation's Edge, but can be read as a
   complete work in itself. (It does, however, give away most of the
   mysteries around which Foundation's Edge is built.)
