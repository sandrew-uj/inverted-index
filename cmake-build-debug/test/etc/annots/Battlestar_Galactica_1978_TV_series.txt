   In a distant star system, the Twelve Colonies of Mankind were reaching
   the end of a thousand-year war with the Cylons, warrior robots created
   by a reptilian race which expired long ago, presumably destroyed by
   their own creations. Humanity was ultimately defeated in a sneak attack
   on their homeworlds by the Cylons, carried out with the help of a human
   traitor, Baltar (John Colicos). Protected by the last surviving capital
   warship, a "battlestar" (from "battle starship"), named Galactica, the
   survivors fled in available ships. The Commander of the Galactica,
   Adama (Lorne Greene), led this "rag-tag fugitive fleet" of 220 ships in
   search of a new home. They began a quest to find the long lost
   thirteenth tribe of humanity that had settled on a legendary planet
   called Earth. However, the Cylons continued to pursue them relentlessly
   across the galaxy.

   The era in which this exodus took place is never clearly stated in the
   series itself. At the start of the series, it is mentioned as being
   "the seventh millennium of time", although it is unknown when this is
   in relation to Earth's history. The implication of the final aired
   episode, "The Hand of God", was that the original series took place
   after the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969 (as the Galactica
   receives a television transmission from Earth showing the landing). The
   later Galactica 1980 series is expressly set in the year 1980 after a
   30-year voyage to Earth.

   Larson, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
   incorporated many themes from Mormon theology into the shows.
