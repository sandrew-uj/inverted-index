   Gersen is taking a short holiday at Smade's Tavern, the only settlement
   on Smade's Planet, which is a "neutral ground" hostelry for crook and
   honest man alike in the Beyond. Here he meets an explorer with a
   problem: Lugo Teehalt has discovered a beautiful and unspoiled world -
   but he has learned that his employer is the notorious criminal Attel
   Malagate, "Malagate the Woe", and Teehalt cannot bear to see his planet
   despoiled by him. However, some of Malagate's minions murder him and
   steal the spaceship parked nearby. By chance, Gersen's spaceship is the
   same common model as Teehalt's; the thieves have taken the wrong ship.
   Gersen departs in the deceased man's ship and thus comes into
   possession of the navigational device that contains the planet's
   coordinates.

   Gersen goes in search of the identity of Teehalt's employer. He quickly
   establishes that his mission was sponsored by someone at Sea Province
   University, an important institution on the planet Alphanor in the
   Rigel Concourse, and narrows Malagate's alter ego to one of three men,
   all senior officials at the university. All deny specific knowledge of
   Lugo Teehalt. By now, Gersen has encountered two of Malagate's chief
   henchmen, whom he saw earlier at Smade's Tavern: Tristano the Earthman,
   and Sivij Suthiro the Sarkoy. He knows that Malagate is aware of what
   he carries, though not his motivation.

   He has also deduced that Malagate is not, as widely assumed, human, but
   rather a "Star King", a member of a species that can rapidly evolve in
   a few generations to resemble its most successful rival. After
   contacting humans, the Star Kings began changing their appearance to
   look more and more like Man. The most successful can readily pass for
   human.

   During his visit to the University, Gersen makes the acquaintance of
   Pallis Atwrode, a clerical assistant. While the two are enjoying an
   evening out, they are attacked by another of Malagate's lieutenants,
   the hideous Hildemar Dasce. Gersen is left unconscious and Pallis
   abducted. Through a combination of detective work and good luck, he
   traces her whereabouts to a secret base belonging to Dasce. He takes
   the three officials to see Teehalt's world, which they are interested
   in purchasing, and along the way, Gersen opportunely stops to rescue
   Pallis and capture Dasce, along with a prisoner Dasce has tortured for
   years, Robin Rampold.

   Gersen convinces Dasce that Malagate betrayed him and then allows Dasce
   to overpower him. Dasce's attempt to avenge himself on Malagate reveals
   the Star King's identity. In combination with strong circumstantial
   evidence, this convinces the other two men to accept Gersen's
   accusations. After Dasce's unsuccessful attack and flight, Gersen tells
   Malagate that he is to be summarily executed. Malagate however succeeds
   in escaping himself, only to be horribly killed a few minutes later by
   one of the native lifeforms on Teehalt's world. At his own request,
   Rampold is left behind. He subsequently turns the tables on his former
   torturer and begins a long-term program of revenge.
