   The story picks up immediately where Gray Lensman left off as Kimball
   and Clarissa are heading off to get ready for their impending marriage.
   Mentor of Arisia stops them by commanding Kim to "think" before he
   acts, and Kim, of course, immediately realizes that the Boskonian
   organization was probably not destroyed when Jarnevon was cracked
   between two other planets and still poses a grave threat to
   Civilization. The wedding is put on hold as Kinnison and the other
   Lensmen set about coming up with a defense for the expected attack upon
   Earth. Since one of the themes of the series is that as soon as one
   side develops a particular weapon, the other soon figures out how to
   duplicate it; the Lensmen assume that Earth will be subjected to an
   attack using either a negasphere (negative energy that consumes
   anything it touches) or two high velocity planets, used like a
   nutcracker. Earth is attacked, and by the slimmest margin, the enemy
   fleet is defeated. As before in this series, the ultimate weapon
   featured in the previous book becomes the standard for the opening
   stages of this one, and newer, more powerful weaponry must be developed
   to deal with the new danger. In this case the weapon developed is the
   "Sunbeam", where the entire output of the sun is converted to an energy
   beam and used to vaporize much of the Boskonian fleet when it shows up.
   By now everyone has "thought screens" (developed by the Velantians)
   rendering the ability of the Lensmen to read others' minds only useful
   when the opposition is captured or sloppy, so the Lensmen must find new
   ways to gather information.

   Kinnison's investigations take him to the planet of Lyrane, ruled by a
   matriarchy of women who have advanced mental abilities, but apparently
   little or no art, literature, music, or other cultural assets. The
   Lyranian who meets Kinnison when he lands immediately tries to mentally
   kill him, as does every other Lyranian. Kinnison handles their mental
   attacks easily. They don't want to cooperate in handing over the
   "zwilnik" (the series' slang for a Boskonian drug dealer) he came for,
   but knowing they can't stop him from taking her, they let them go.
   After Kinnison's ship leaves, Lyrane comes under attack by two
   Boskonian ships and the matriarchs, who are helpless against thought
   screened pirates with advanced weapons, have to call Kinnison and the
   Patrol to come back and help them.

   On the way back to Tellus (Earth) with the zwilnik, Kinnison decides
   that, in some way, Lyrane is connected with Boskone. He knows that no
   male, except a Lensman, could survive a minute in that man-hating
   culture, and even a Lensman would have to spend all his time protecting
   himself. Only a female could be effective, but there were no female
   Lensmen. Kinnison makes the decision, after consulting Mentor, that the
   best person for the job is Clarissa MacDougall. She flatly refuses to
   have any contact with Mentor, so it's up to Kinnison to give her the
   mental training needed to make her a Lensman. Mentor sees to it that
   her Lens is delivered, and as Civilization's first female Lensman, she
   goes to Lyrane to try to find its link, if any, to Boskone.

   After sending Clarissa to Lyrane, Kinnison and Nadreck set about
   following a lead to the main Boskonian threat by tracing an enemy
   communications line leading into the second galaxy. The Galactic Patrol
   is by now ready to begin a full-scale invasion of the second galaxy, so
   Port Admiral Haynes mobilizes the Grand Fleet. With the patrol invading
   their home galaxy in overwhelming force, the Boskonians are too busy to
   worry about a communications line, so Kinnison and Nadreck trace it all
   the way back to the Thrallis system. Nadreck takes on the Boskonian
   headquarters on the frigid world of Onlo and sets about carefully
   fomenting discord by tampering with the minds of the various Onlonians
   he finds there. Kinnison infiltrates Thrale, inhabited by a near-human
   race that forms the core race around which Boskone's strength is built.

   Kinnison infiltrates the Tyrant of Thrale's personal guards. Since
   advancement within Boskonia is based on deceit and assassination, and
   as a second stage Lensman is much better at anything needing
   intelligence than the average Boskonian, he soon rises to a position
   just under the Tyrant. Soon he finds a way to assassinate the Tyrant
   and take his place. only to find the real power is in the hands of
   Fossten, the Prime Minister. Kinnison must not give the mentally
   super-powerful prime-minister any reason to doubt that he is anything
   but a loyal member of Boskonia, so he does just what the former Tyrant
   was planning to do, he directs the construction of a massive fleet to
   attack the Patrol's foothold in the Second Galaxy: the massively
   fortified planet of Klovia.

   He keeps the Patrol advised of the construction and the progress of the
   fleet via his Lens, so when Thrale launches its attack, they sail into
   a carefully planned trap. Since the Boskonian fleet that attacked Earth
   was completely destroyed by the Sunbeam, and no word of the weapon
   could be sent back to Boskonia, the Tyrant's fleet sailed directly into
   the path of the Sunbeam, and between Sunbeam and the Patrol Grand
   Fleet, it was totally destroyed. The ship Kinnison and Fossten were on
   wasn't destroyed because Kinnison disabled its drive and it dropped out
   of the fleet just before the battle was joined.

   While the patrol was taking care of the Boskonian fleet, Kimball faces
   off against Fossten. A battle royal ensues, deadly to the crew members
   even though it was fought with mental weapons. The spent forces
   bouncing off the mental shields of the two combatants were enough to
   destroy the minds of all the crew members of the ship. Kinnison at last
   beats down Fossten's mental shield and what he sees before him is
   basically just a brain, looking enough like Mentor of Arisia to be his
   brother. Kinnison sends a lensed thought to Mentor and asks what an
   Arisian is doing leading Boskone? Mentor's explanation satisfies
   Kinnison so he never realizes that in actuality, he has just defeated
   and destroyed Gharlane of Eddore, the entity who, as Nero, Gray Roger,
   and many others, was responsible for most of the death and misery in
   Earth's history. Mentor has used his mental power to make Kinnison see
   what he thinks is an Arisian instead of Gharlane's actual form. The
   time has not yet come for any member of Civilization to see what the
   ultimate leaders of Boskone actually are.

   Kimball Kinnison returns to Thrale with agents of the Patrol to begin
   the slow and painful process of bringing Thrale and the rest of
   Boskonia into Civilization. While Kinnison is taking over the
   warm-blooded, oxygen-breathing part of Boskonia, Nadreck is doing the
   same with the Onlonians, leaders of the frigid world dwellers of
   Boskonia. Nadreck isn't Kinnison and goes about it in a completely
   different way, but the results are the same and Onlo falls.
   Civilization and the Galactic Patrol are now in control of both the
   first and second galaxy.

   The book ends with Kinnison being made Galactic Coordinator of the
   Second Galaxy and finally marrying Clarissa MacDougall.
