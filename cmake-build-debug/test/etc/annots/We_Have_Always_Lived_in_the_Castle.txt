   Merricat Blackwood, her elder sister Constance, and their ailing Uncle
   Julian live in a large house on extensive grounds, in isolation from
   the nearby village. Constance has not left their home in six years,
   going no farther than her large garden. Uncle Julian, who uses a
   wheelchair, obsessively writes and re-writes notes for his memoirs,
   while Constance cares for him.

   Through Uncle Julian's ramblings, the events of the past are revealed,
   including what happened to the remainder of the Blackwood family: six
   years ago both the Blackwood parents (John and Ellen), an aunt
   (Julian's wife Dorothy), and a younger brother (Thomas) were murdered -
   poisoned with arsenic, which was mixed into the family's sugar bowl and
   sprinkled onto blackberries at dinner. Julian, though poisoned, had
   survived; Constance, who did not put sugar on her berries, was arrested
   for, and eventually acquitted of, the crime. Merricat was not at
   dinner, having been sent to bed without dinner as punishment. The
   people of the village believed that Constance had gotten away with
   murder, and thus began to ostracize the family. The three remaining
   Blackwoods had grown accustomed to their isolation, leading a quiet,
   happy existence. Merricat is the family's sole contact with the outside
   world, walking into the village twice a week and carrying home
   groceries and library books; on these trips she is faced directly with
   the hostility of the villagers and often followed by groups of
   children, who taunt her, often with an accusing rhyme. They are quite
   harsh and rude, and it is made obvious that Merricat knows that her
   family is hated by the townsfolk.

   Merricat is protective of her sister and is a practitioner of
   sympathetic magic. She feels that a dangerous change is approaching;
   her response is to reassure herself of the various magical safeguards
   she has placed around their home, including a book nailed to a tree.
   After discovering that the book has fallen down, Merricat becomes
   convinced that danger is imminent. Before she can warn Constance, their
   estranged cousin, Charles, appears for a visit.

   Charles quickly befriends Constance, insinuating himself into her
   confidence. Charles is aware of Merricat's hostility and is
   increasingly rude to her and impatient of Julian's weaknesses. He makes
   many references to the money the sisters keep locked in their father's
   safe, and gradually forms something of an alliance with Constance.
   Merricat perceives Charles as a threat, calling him a demon and a
   ghost, and tries various magical and otherwise disruptive means to
   drive him from the house. Uncle Julian is increasingly disgusted by
   Charles, and Constance is caught between the warring parties.

   One night before dinner, Constance sends Merricat upstairs to wash her
   hands, and Merricat, in her anger against Charles, pushes Charles'
   still-smoldering pipe into a wastebasket filled with newspapers. The
   pipe sets fire to the family home. The villagers arrive to put out the
   fire, but once it's out, in a wave of long-repressed hatred for the
   Blackwoods, they begin throwing rocks at the windows, smashing them and
   surging into the house to destroy whatever they can, all the while
   chanting their children's taunting rhyme. Merricat and Constance,
   driven outdoors, are encircled by some of the villagers who seem on the
   verge of attacking them, en masse. Merricat and Constance flee for
   safety into the woods. In the course of the fire, Julian dies of what
   is implied to be a heart attack, and Charles attempts to take the
   family safe. While Merricat and Constance shelter for the night under a
   tree Merricat has made into a hideaway, Constance confesses for the
   first time that she always knew Merricat poisoned the family. Merricat
   readily admits to the deed, saying that she put the poison in the sugar
   bowl because she knew Constance would not take sugar.

   Upon returning to their ruined home, Constance and Merricat proceed to
   salvage what is left of their belongings, close off those rooms too
   damaged to use, and start their lives anew in the little space left to
   them. The house, now without a roof, resembles a castle "turreted and
   open to the sky". The villagers, awakening at last to a sense of guilt,
   begin to leave food on their doorstep, while developing stories about
   them akin to folklore. Charles returns once to try to renew his
   acquaintance with Constance, but she now knows his real purpose is
   greed and ignores him. The two sisters choose to remain alone and
   unseen by the rest of the world.
