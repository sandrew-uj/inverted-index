   The central plot device is the "macroscope", a large crystal that can
   be used to focus a newly discovered type of particle, the "macron".
   Macrons are not subject to many of the effects that interfere with
   light, and as a result the macroscope can focus on any location in
   space-time with exceptional clarity, producing what is essentially a
   telescope of infinite resolution in the space-time continuum. The
   macroscope has been built into a solar-orbiting space station where
   scientists visit to book time on the device. Using it, they are able to
   explore space like never before. Among their many discoveries are
   numerous planets and two intelligent alien races. Using the macroscope,
   observers were able to look into one race's historical records, finding
   numerous parallels with human life on Earth. The race is now in
   societal decline, and the implications are worrying.

   The macroscope's clear view across space also makes it an ideal
   communications system for intelligent races, who broadcast signals by
   generating macrons, a technique not yet understood on Earth. However,
   over-riding all of these signals is another of enormous power, one of
   such strength that it must have been constructed by a Type II
   civilization. This signal repeats itself, starting with instructions on
   basic math and progressing to ever-more complex information. Viewers
   with high enough intelligence, an IQ of 150, reach a point where the
   information causes them to go insane or die. Those without the
   intelligence to understand the advanced portions of the signal are
   unaffected. The signal appears to be a deliberate attempt to "jam"
   macroscopic communications, blocking those with the ability to
   understand the other signals from being able to see them. They refer to
   the blocking signal simply as the "destroyer".

   The protagonist of the story, Ivo Archer, is taken to the macroscope
   station on the invitation of a childhood friend, Brad Carpenter. Ivo
   has an unexplained link to a mysterious hyper-intelligent character,
   Schoen, and Brad believes Schoen may be able to break through the
   destroyer signal. Ivo is not so convinced, and is reluctant to ask for
   Schoen's help. This reluctance is cause for some misunderstanding with
   Brad's girlfriend, Afra Summerfield, with whom Ivo falls hopelessly in
   love.

   While inadvertently viewing the destroyer signal with Brad and a
   Senator visiting the project, only Ivo survives the experience. Afra
   concludes Ivo is not intelligent enough to be affected, and finds him
   somewhat beneath her as a result. The Senator's death sparks a series
   of events that lead to Ivo, Afra and two other station members, Harold
   and Beatryx, stealing the macroscope. Afra, still in love with Brad and
   hoping to find a cure, brings his body along, now in a vegetative
   state. They detach the macroscope from the station and fly off with it
   while United Nations ships give chase. With time on their hands, Ivo
   turns to the macroscope and finds a way to avoid being overwhelmed by
   the destroyer signal. This reveals a number of broadcasts from farther
   out in space. Ivo demonstrates this technique to the others, allowing
   Harold and Afra to view the signals formerly being hidden. Harold, a
   talented engineer, uses the information from one of the signals to
   build a device reducing their bodies to a liquid state, allowing them
   to accelerate at 10 g and escape the pursuing ships.

   They travel to Neptune space, following a cryptic message left by
   Schoen. Here they set up camp on Triton. Afra attempts to cure Brad by
   shocking him while he is being reconstituted from the liquid state, but
   the attempt fails and Brad is killed. Over time, and with further help
   from Ivo, the group watches a benign form of the entire broadcast,
   which they come to call "traveller". The liquefaction technique is only
   the first of many shown in the traveller signal, which describes an
   entire suite of technologies that allow interstellar travel. Using the
   instructions in the signal, they convert Neptune into an interstellar
   spaceship.

   Schoen briefly makes his first appearance during construction,
   revealing himself to be an alternate personality within Ivo's brain.
   Schoen is ostensibly the body's "owner", having created the Ivo
   personality to avoid being the subject of experimentation. Schoen has
   frightening intelligence, but having given over his body to Ivo at the
   age of five, is still a child and largely without morals. In an attempt
   to take control of the body, Schoen traps Ivo in a historical drama
   running in his own brain. Over time, Ivo sees parallels between the
   characters in the drama and the group in the ship, and eventually
   escapes the illusion and re-asserts control.

   The group decides to hunt down the source of the destroyer signal in an
   effort to turn it off. Travelling 15,000 light years from Earth, they
   find it is being broadcast from an abandoned space station. Exploring
   the inner portions of the station, which is a large museum, they are
   individually drawn into a series of visions that reveal different
   aspects of the nature of the destroyer and its history. The traveller
   signal had arrived relatively late in the history of the galaxy, in the
   midst of flourishing communications via macroscope. Armed with the
   ability for interstellar travel, wars broke out that destroyed
   countless civilizations. The destroyer station, one of six in the
   galaxy, was set up to prevent this until the races reached the required
   level of cultural sophistication, if they ever did.

   Emerging from one of these visions, Afra discovers that Schoen has once
   again taken over from Ivo. Intelligent enough that the signal would
   kill him, he has solved this problem via surgery that altered his brain
   chemistry to block most of the signal. This took six months to
   complete, keeping him "pinned" during the interval. Schoen plays a game
   with Afra, now the only other surviving member of the original group,
   with the stakes being that the winner gets to select who, Schoen or
   Ivo, gets the body. During the game, the real reason for Ivo's creation
   comes forth; the original Ivo was a girl with intelligence similar to
   Schoen's, a situation neither could tolerate. After murdering her
   during a game played to the death with rules only the two of them could
   comprehend, Schoen created the new Ivo to escape the retribution of his
   peers.

   Playing the game by the rules and losing, Afra instead tricks Schoen
   into the room broadcasting the destroyer signal. Here it is so powerful
   that it overwhelms Schoen's surgical blocks, and Ivo is able to take
   control. Now in command of his own personality, along with all of
   Schoen's intellectual capacity, Ivo wins Afra's heart. At the end of
   the story the reader is left to decide whether or not the people of
   Earth are mature enough and ready for interstellar travel.
