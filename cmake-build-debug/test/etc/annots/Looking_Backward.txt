   Bellamy's novel tells the story of a hero figure named Julian West, a
   young American, who towards the end of the 19th century, falls into a
   deep, hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up 113 years later. He finds
   himself in the same location (Boston, Massachusetts), but in a totally
   changed world: It is the year 2000, and while he was sleeping, the
   United States has been transformed into a socialist utopia. The
   remainder of the book outlines Bellamy's thoughts about improving the
   future. The major themes include problems associated with capitalism, a
   proposed socialist solution of a nationalization of all industry, and
   the use of an "industrial army" to organize production and
   distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under
   such conditions.

   The young man readily finds a guide, Doctor Leete, who shows him around
   and explains all the advances of this new age, including drastically
   reduced working hours for people performing menial jobs and almost
   instantaneous, Internet-like delivery of goods. Everyone retires with
   full benefits at age 45, and may eat in any of the public kitchens
   (realized as factory-kitchens in the 1920s-30s in the USSR). The
   productive capacity of the United States is nationally owned, and the
   goods of society are equally distributed to its citizens. A
   considerable portion of the book is dialogue between Leete and West
   wherein West expresses his confusion about how the future society works
   and Leete explains the answers using various methods, such as metaphors
   or direct comparisons with 19th-century society.

   Although Bellamy's novel did not discuss technology or the economy in
   detail, commentators frequently compare Looking Backward with actual
   economic and technological developments. For example, Julian West is
   taken to a store which (with its descriptions of cutting out the
   middleman to cut down on waste in a similar way to the consumers'
   cooperatives of his own day based on the Rochdale Principles of 1844)
   somewhat resembles a modern warehouse club like BJ's, Costco, or Sam's
   Club. He additionally introduces a concept of "credit" cards in
   chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25, and 26, but these actually function like
   modern debit cards. All citizens receive an equal amount of "credit".
   Those with more difficult, specialized, dangerous, or unpleasant jobs
   work fewer hours (in contrast to the real-world practice of paying them
   more for their efforts of, presumably, the same hours, or of those jobs
   being manned by members of the impoverished unable to find other forms
   of employment). Bellamy also predicts both sermons and music being
   available in the home through cable "telephone" (already demonstrated
   but commercialized only in 1890 as Theatrophone in France).

   Despite the "ethical" character of his socialism (though he was
   initially reluctant to use the term "socialism"), Bellamy's ideas
   somewhat reflect classical Marxism. In chapter 19, for example, he has
   the new legal system explained. Most civil suits have ended in
   socialism, while crime has become a medical issue. The idea of atavism,
   then current, is employed to explain crimes not related to inequality
   (which Bellamy thinks will vanish with socialism). Remaining criminals
   are medically treated. One professional judge presides, appointing two
   colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases. If all do not
   agree on the verdict, then it must be tried over. Chapters 15 and 16
   have an explanation of how free, independent public art and news
   outlets could be provided in a more libertarian socialist system. In
   one case, Bellamy even writes, "the nation is the sole employer and
   capitalist".
