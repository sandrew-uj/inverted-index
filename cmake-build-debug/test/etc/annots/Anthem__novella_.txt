   Equality 7-2521, a 21-year-old man writing by candlelight in a tunnel
   under the earth, tells the story of his life up to that point. He
   exclusively uses plural pronouns ("we", "our", "they") to refer to
   himself and others. He was raised like all children in his society,
   away from his parents in collective homes. He believes he has a "curse"
   that makes him learn quickly and ask many questions. He excels at the
   Science of Things and dreams of becoming a Scholar, but when the
   Council of Vocations assigns his Life Mandate, he is assigned to be a
   Street Sweeper.

   Equality 7-2521 accepts his street sweeping assignment as penance for
   his Transgression of Preference in secretly desiring to be a Scholar.
   He works with Union 5-3992 and International 4-8818, who is Equality's
   only friend (which is another Transgression of Preference). Despite
   International's protests that any exploration unauthorized by a Council
   is forbidden, Equality explores a tunnel and finds metal tracks.
   Equality believes the tunnel is from the Unmentionable Times of the
   distant past. He begins sneaking away from his community to use the
   tunnel as a laboratory for scientific experiments. He is using stolen
   paper to write his journal.

   While cleaning a road at the edge of the City, Equality meets Liberty
   5-3000, a 17-year-old Peasant girl who works in the fields. He commits
   another transgression by thinking constantly of her, instead of waiting
   to be assigned a woman at the annual Time of Mating. She has dark eyes
   and golden hair, and he names her "The Golden One". When he speaks to
   her, he discovers that she also thinks of him. He reveals his secret
   name for her, and Liberty tells Equality she has named him "The
   Unconquered".

   Continuing his scientific work, Equality rediscovers electricity. In
   the ruins of the tunnel, he finds a glass box with wires that gives off
   light when he passes electricity through it. He decides to take his
   discovery to the World Council of Scholars; he thinks such a great gift
   to mankind will outweigh his transgressions and lead to him being made
   a Scholar. However, one night his absence from the Home of the Street
   Sweepers is noticed. He is whipped and held in the Palace of Corrective
   Detention. The night before the World Council of Scholars is set to
   meet, he easily escapes; there are no guards because no one has ever
   attempted escape before. The next day he presents his work to the World
   Council of Scholars. Horrified that he has done unauthorized research,
   they assail him as a "wretch" and a "gutter cleaner" and say he must be
   punished. They want to destroy his discovery so it will not disrupt the
   plans of the World Council and the Department of Candles. Equality
   seizes the box, cursing the council before fleeing into the forest that
   lies outside the City.

   In the forest, Equality sees himself as damned for having left his
   fellow men, but he enjoys his freedom. No one will pursue him into this
   forbidden place. He only misses Liberty. On his second day of living in
   the forest, Liberty appears; she followed him into the forest and vows
   to stay with him forever. They live together in the forest and try to
   express their love for one another, but they lack the words to speak of
   love as individuals.

   They find a house from the Unmentionable Times in the mountains and
   decide to live in it. While reading books from the house's library,
   Equality discovers the word "I" and tells Liberty about it. Having
   rediscovered individuality, they give themselves new names from the
   books: Equality becomes "Prometheus" and Liberty becomes "Gaea". Months
   later, Gaea is pregnant with Prometheus' child. Prometheus wonders how
   men in the past could have given up their individuality; he plans a
   future in which they will regain it.
