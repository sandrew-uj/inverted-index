   Richard St Vier, a swordsman-for-hire based in the seedy neighborhood
   of Riverside, kills two men at a party thrown by Lord Horn. When a man
   intimidates Richard's lover Alec, Richard kills him as a warning to the
   other Riverside residents.

   Lord Michael Godwin rejects the advances of Lord Horn. Michael meets
   Richard on the street and asks for sword lessons, but Richard declines.
   Michael begins taking lessons from Vincent Applethorpe. At a party, he
   humiliates Horn and flirts with Duchess Tremontaine, but she rejects
   him for Chancellor Ferris. Later that night, Ferris asks Richard to
   kill an opponent in a duel. He shows Richard a signet indicating that
   Tremontaine is also secretly supporting him. Richard meets with
   Katherine, a former lover, to obtain the name of his target: Crescent
   Chancellor Basil Halliday. Halliday has consolidated executive power
   for himself and is fighting to remove term limits on the
   Chancellorship; Ferris wants to become Crescent Chancellor himself.

   An enraged Horn tries to hire Richard to kill Michael; Richard refuses.
   Alec is kidnapped on the orders of Lord Horn. With Alec as leverage,
   Horn blackmails Richard into challenging Michael. Applethorpe accepts
   the challenge in Michael's place, and Richard kills him. Duchess
   Tremontaine rescues Michael, who leaves town. Horn releases Alec.
   Richard kills two of Horn's men, then tortures and kills Horn. Alec,
   fearful of the manhunt Richard has brought down upon them, leaves
   Richard. On Ferris's orders, Katherine betrays Richard. He is arrested
   and put on trial. Alec joins the Chancellors, revealing himself to be
   the grandson of Duchess Tremontaine. He calls for an assembly of the
   full Council of Lords.

   Alec confronts Ferris at the council, revealing that Tremontaine was
   not involved in the plot to kill Halliday. Ferris is forced to take
   credit for Horn's death in order to keep the plot against Halliday
   secret; he is sentenced to become the ambassador to a backwater nation.
   Alec rejects the dukedom and returns to Riverside to be with Richard.
