   In 2500, as a result of the sea levels rising over 7,600 metres
   (24,900 ft), every continent on Earth is now underwater. The remains of
   human civilization live on ramshackle floating communities known as
   atolls, having long forgotten about living on land. People believe that
   there is a mythological "Dryland" somewhere in the endless ocean.

   The Mariner, a lone drifter, arrives on his trimaran to trade dirt, a
   rare commodity, for other supplies. The atoll's residents see that the
   Mariner is a mutant with gills and webbed feet and decide to drown him
   in the atoll's recycling pit, a kind of liquid compost facility. Just
   then, the atoll is attacked by the Smokers, a gang of pirates seeking a
   girl named Enola who, according to their leader the Deacon, has a map
   to Dryland tattooed on her back. Enola's guardian Helen attempts to
   escape with Enola on a gas balloon with Gregor, an inventor, but the
   balloon is released too early. Helen instead frees the Mariner and
   insists that he take the two of them with him.

   The three escape to open sea aboard the trimaran, pursued by the
   Smokers. They escape, but Helen's naive actions result in damage to the
   Mariner's boat. He angrily cuts her hair, and then Enola's. Helen
   explains that she believes humans once lived on land and demands to
   know where the Mariner collected his dirt. He provides her with a
   diving bell and dives with her underwater, showing the remains of a
   city and the dirt on the ocean's floor, affirming Helen's belief. When
   they surface, they find that the Smokers have caught up to them,
   threatening to kill them if they do not reveal Enola, who is hiding
   aboard the boat. The Smokers abduct Enola and try to kill Helen and the
   Mariner. The Mariner takes Helen, and they dive underwater to avoid
   capture, with the gilled Mariner helping Helen breathe. When they
   surface, they find that his boat has been destroyed. Gregor manages to
   catch up to and rescue them, and he takes them to a new makeshift atoll
   inhabited by the survivors of the first attack.

   The Mariner takes a captured Smoker's jet ski to chase down the Deacon
   aboard the hulk of the Exxon Valdez. With most of the Smokers below
   deck to row the tanker, the Mariner confronts the Deacon, threatening
   to ignite the reserves of oil still on the tanker unless he returns
   Enola. The Deacon calls the Mariner's bluff, knowing that would destroy
   the ship, but, to his surprise, the Mariner drops a flare into the oil.
   The ship's lower decks are engulfed in fire, and the ship starts to
   sink. The Mariner rescues Enola and escapes via a rope from Gregor's
   balloon with Helen and the Atoll Enforcer aboard. As the Mariner brings
   Enola to Helen, the Deacon manages to grab the rope to escape the
   sinking ship. He is kicked off into the water, but climbs aboard a jet
   ski. He fires upon the balloon, shaking Enola from the balloon and into
   the ocean. As The Deacon and some of his men converge on Enola to
   capture her, the Mariner makes an impromptu bungee jump from the
   balloon to grab Enola right before the Deacon and his men collide and
   die in the explosion.

   Sometime later, Gregor has been able to identify the tattoo on Enola's
   back as coordinates with reversed directions. Following the map,
   Gregor, the Mariner, the Atoll Enforcer, Helen, and Enola discover
   Dryland, the top of Mount Everest, filled with vegetation and wildlife.
   They also find a crude hut with the remains of Enola's parents.
   Realizing he does not belong on Dryland, the Mariner decides that he
   cannot stay as the sea calls to him. He takes a wooden sailboat and
   departs as Helen and Enola bid him farewell.
