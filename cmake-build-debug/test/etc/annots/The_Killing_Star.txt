   In the late 21st century Earth is at peace. Humans now command
   self-replicating machines that create engineering marvels on enormous
   scales. Artificial habitats dot the solar system. Anti-matter driven
   Valkyrie rockets carry explorers to the stars at nearly the speed of
   light.

   Then, swarms of missiles travelling at speed close to the speed of
   light hit Earth. Though they are merely boulder-sized chunks of metal,
   they move fast enough to hit with the force of many nuclear arsenals.
   They are impossible to track and to stop. Humanity is almost wiped out
   by the bombardment.

   A handful of survivors desperately struggle to escape the alien mop-up
   fleet. They hide close to the Sun, inside asteroids, beneath the crusts
   of moons, within ice rings, and in the interstellar space. Most are
   however hunted down and slaughtered.

   The last man and woman on Earth are captured as zoo specimens. In the
   belly of an alien starship, a squid-like being relates to them the
   pitiless logic behind humankind's execution: the moment humans learned
   to travel at relativistic speeds was the moment mankind simply became
   too dangerous of a neighbor to have around. The final reveal is that
   the alien is itself subservient to a powerful artificial intelligence.
