   Marcus Yallow is a 17-year-old hacker/techno whiz from San Francisco.
   One day Marcus and his best friend Darryl play truant from school to
   play an Alternate Reality Game. A terrorist attack is perpetrated
   against the city, and the four are captured and detained under
   suspicion of terrorism.

   After a series of interrogations that take place over a period of six
   days, Marcus, Jolu, and Vanessa are finally released; Darryl's
   whereabouts are unknown. The DHS tells Marcus that they will be
   monitoring his actions and moves because he is still a suspect. Marcus
   is "infuriated at how his civil rights  ignored."

   In response to the increasing surveillance of the city and its
   citizens, Marcus creates Xnet, a private mesh network intended to allow
   people to communicate freely while fighting "the surveillance
   state." Through XNet, using his pseudonym 'Mik3y', Marcus
   encourages his peers to rebel against the DHS surveillance.

   While introducing a group to Cryptography during a key signing party,
   Marcus meets Ange, and shortly thereafter they begin to date.

   When a former prisoner who was held by the DHS tells Marcus that Darryl
   is still alive, Marcus tells a reporter and his family about his
   actions taken against the DHS. The journalist's story is then published
   and the DHS takes Marcus into custody again. On order from the
   governor, California highway patrol troopers raid the DHS compound
   during a waterboarding interrogation and arrest the DHS agents. Darryl
   is subsequently freed and Marcus, after his parents have to pay his
   bail to make sure he doesn't go to prison, finally returns to his life
   the way it was before the terrorist attacks.
