   The often surreal and dream-like plot of the novel opens on the first
   day of spring 2001, with Maxine Tarnow walking her two sons to school
   before going to work.

   Maxine, ex certified fraud examiner, is approached by Reg Despard
   regarding suspicious goings-on at hashslingrz, a computer security firm
   run by Gabriel Ice. She finds much of their financial numbers fail
   basic plausibility statistics, and notices large payments going to a
   now defunct website. She talks to an ex-temp for that site, learns they
   have strong Arab connections and move large sums of money through
   hawala, and notices she is being tailed afterwards. She talks to Rocky
   Slagiatt, VC investor behind some of Gabriel's start-ups, who is
   nervous about where they may be going. Meanwhile, mysterious government
   heavyweight Nicholas Windust puts pressure on Maxine, asking her to
   pump her Israeli brother-in-law for information regarding Mossad
   hacking methods.

   Maxine's friend March Kelleher is suspicious about the activities of
   Gabriel Ice, her son-in-law, and asks Maxine to informally interview
   her daughter Tallis, Gabriel's wife. Tallis does admit to having
   concerns, but is unwilling to allow any auditing. Rocky introduces
   Maxine to Igor Dashkov, who asks her about Madoff Securities. A quick
   scan reveals to Maxine that the numbers are obviously too good to be
   true. Maxine pays a visit to Darklinear Solutions, another mystery
   vendor found associated with hashslingrz. She sees Tallis exiting the
   building, walking a bit; then someone else exiting, proceeding in the
   opposite direction, getting in a go-go mobile and picking up Tallis, so
   Maxine trails them.

   The next morning, Maxine has an unexpected pre-dawn visit from Russian
   heavy Igor and March. Igor is very thankful, realizing he got out of
   Madoff Securities in time, and rewards her with illegally unhealthy ice
   cream. March and Maxine deliver some money to March's ex-husband, Sid,
   who takes them on his boat for a short drop off, but he is approached
   by patrol boats and races down the Hudson River, only shaking off his
   pursuit when he reaches New Jersey near the landfill islands.

   Maxine receives a videotape which directs her to a Montauk house that
   suspect Vip Epperdew is known to visit. Epperdew is involved with
   zapper fraud. Trying to find the exact house, a local informs her the
   house burned down a few weeks previously, and sneaks her into the
   mansion Gabriel Ice is building, where he has her help him steal
   vintage wines. She finds a mysterious code-locked door which she breaks
   into, leading to a baffling underground complex. The sudden appearance
   of a strange, short, human-like creature sends her into a panic and she
   flees in a hurry.

   Maxine, in following the hashslingrz money, finds some of it is being
   diverted into Lester Traipse's account. She confronts him, and he is
   terrified, and intends to return the money, and asks Maxine to arrange
   terms. She agrees, but next day he is found dead, an apparent suicide.
   With the help of Conkling Speedwell, a man with a superhuman forensic
   sense of smell, she learns there is a peculiar mystery scent at the
   scene of Lester's death. This scent is identified as "9:30 Cologne",
   and is soon connected with Windust. The smell also horrifies a friend
   of Conkling's with a supernatural sense of "foresmell" who has been
   smelling not-yet-existent great fires in New York for some time now.

   Maxine receives a videotape of men apparently rehearsing on the Deseret
   rooftop the shooting down of a jet plane using a Stinger missile. She
   attends a humongous dotcom-style-excess party, sponsored by Gabriel Ice
   on Saturday night, September 8. Everyone is partying like it's 1999.
   She finds Felix, a teenage programmer also involved with zapper fraud,
   but he won't say anything about Lester. The following Tuesday, the 9/11
   attacks occur. Ex-husband Horst had told Maxine the day before he was
   going to be working all night, and she now fears the worst. But he and
   his business partner had watched Monday Night Football and fell asleep,
   and next morning joined the masses seeking refuge in New Jersey, and
   was unable to get through. March, a blogger, leans towards low-level
   conspiracy theories (but nothing close to truther ideas).

   Maxine takes Horst back. Eric and Driscoll, two programmers, move in
   with them as temporarily homeless. March finds herself hunted and
   homeless, but she keeps up her blog using WiFi. Gabriel breaks up with
   Tallis. Justin and Lucas, designers of the open-source program
   DeepArcher, find their work a home for numerous 9/11 ghosts. Maxine
   finds Windust's murdered body, and refuses to get involved. The
   Russians try a vircator attack on a Gabriel server farm.

   The book ends with few resolutions. Maxine's children Otis and Ziggy
   display a new level of maturity and independence, as they walk to
   school alone.
