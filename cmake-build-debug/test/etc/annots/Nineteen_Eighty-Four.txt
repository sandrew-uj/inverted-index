   In the year 1984, civilization has been damaged by world war, civil
   conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly known as Great
   Britain) is a province of Oceania, one of the three totalitarian
   super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the "Party" under the
   ideology of "Ingsoc" (a Newspeak shortening of "English Socialism") and
   the mysterious leader Big Brother, who has an intense cult of
   personality. The Party brutally purges out anyone who does not fully
   conform to their regime using the Thought Police and constant
   surveillance through telescreens (two-way televisions), cameras, and
   hidden microphones. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become
   "unpersons", disappearing with all evidence of their existence
   destroyed.

   In London, Winston Smith is a member of the Outer Party, working at the
   Ministry of Truth, where he rewrites historical records to conform to
   the state's ever-changing version of history. Winston revises past
   editions of The Times, while the original documents are destroyed after
   being dropped into ducts leading to the memory hole. He secretly
   opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion, despite knowing that
   he is already a "thoughtcriminal" and likely to be caught one day.

   While in a prole (Proletariat) neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington,
   the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary where he writes
   thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother, and also writes that
   "if there is hope, it lies in the proles". To his dismay, when he
   visits a prole quarter he discovers they have no political
   consciousness. An old man he talks to there has no significant memory
   of life before the Revolution. As he works in the Ministry of Truth, he
   observes Julia, a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at
   the ministry, whom Winston suspects of being a spy against him, and
   develops an intense hatred of her. He vaguely suspects that his
   superior, an Inner Party official O'Brien, is part of an enigmatic
   underground resistance movement known as the Brotherhood, formed by Big
   Brother's reviled political rival Emmanuel Goldstein. In a lunch
   conversation with his co-worker Syme, who is assisting in developing a
   revised version of Newspeak (a controlled language of limited
   vocabulary), Syme bluntly reveals the true purpose of Newspeak: to
   reduce the capacity of human thought. Winston reflects that Syme will
   disappear as he is "too intelligent" and therefore dangerous to the
   Party. Winston also discusses preparations for Hate Week with his
   neighbour and colleague Parsons.

   One day, Julia secretly hands Winston a love note, and the two begin an
   affair; an act of rebellion as the Party insists that sex is only for
   reproduction. Julia also loathes the Party, but is politically
   apathetic and uninterested in overthrowing the regime, thinking it
   impossible. Initially meeting in the country, they later meet in a
   rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During the affair, Winston
   remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the
   1950s and his tense relationship with his wife Katharine, from whom he
   is separated (divorce is not permitted by the Party). He also notices
   the disappearance of Syme. Weeks later, O'Brien invites Winston to his
   flat, which is of far higher quality than Winston's. O'Brien introduces
   himself as a member of the Brotherhood and sends Winston a copy of The
   Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism by Goldstein.
   Meanwhile, during the nation's Hate Week, Oceania's enemy suddenly
   changes from Eurasia to Eastasia, which goes mostly unnoticed. Winston
   is recalled to the Ministry to help make the major necessary revisions
   of the records. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which
   explains how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its
   slogans, and the concept of perpetual war. It argues that the Party can
   be overthrown if proles rise up against it. However, to Winston, it
   does not answer 'why' the Party is motivated to maintain power.

   Winston and Julia are captured and imprisoned when Mr. Charrington is
   revealed to be a Thought Police agent. At the Ministry of Love, Winston
   briefly interacts with colleagues who have been arrested for other
   offences. O'Brien arrives, revealing himself as a Thought Police agent,
   who tells Winston that he will never know whether the Brotherhood
   actually exists and that Emmanuel Goldstein's book was written
   collaboratively by O'Brien and (presumably) other Party members. Over
   several months, Winston is starved and tortured to "cure" himself of
   his "insanity" by changing his own perception to fit in line with the
   Party. O'Brien reveals that the Party "seeks power for its own sake."
   When he taunts Winston by asking if there is any humiliation he has not
   been made to suffer, Winston points out that the Party has not managed
   to make him betray Julia, even after he accepted the party's
   invincibility and its principles. Winston accepts internally that he
   really means he has not rescinded his feelings toward Julia; he betrays
   her by revealing her crimes many times. He fantasizes that moments
   before his execution his heretic side will emerge, which, as long as he
   is killed while unrepentant, will be his great victory over the Party.

   O'Brien takes Winston to Room 101 for the final stage of re-education,
   which contains each prisoner's worst fear, indicating that the level of
   surveillance on the public is far more thorough than initially believed
   by Winston. Confronted with a wire cage holding frenzied rats, his
   biggest fear, Winston willingly betrays Julia by wishing the suffering
   upon her instead. Winston is released back into public life and
   continues to frequent the Chestnut Tree Cafe. One day, Winston
   encounters Julia, who was also tortured. Both reveal that they have
   betrayed the other and no longer have feelings for each other. Back in
   the cafe, a news alert sounds and celebrates Oceania's supposed massive
   victory over Eurasian armies in Africa. Winston finally accepts that he
   loves Big Brother.
