   Eight years after the Descolada virus is cured, Xenologer Pipo and his
   thirteen-year-old son and apprentice Libo have developed a friendship
   with the Pequeninos. They allow Novinha to join their science team as
   the colony's only xenobiologist after she manages to pass the test at
   age thirteen. After accidentally sharing information about human
   genders with a male Pequenino named Rooter, the scientists find
   Rooter's body eviscerated, a sapling planted within it, and guess this
   may be a torturous sacrificial ritual. Restrictions on studying the
   Pequeninos bar the humans from asking directly.

   A few years later, Novinha discovers that every lifeform on Lusitania
   carries the Descolada virus which, though lethal to humans, appears to
   serve a beneficial purpose to native lifeforms. When Pipo learns of
   this, he suddenly has an insight, and before he tells the others, races
   off to talk to the Pequeninos. Hours later, Libo and Novinha find
   Pipo's body cut open just as Rooter's had been, but with no sapling
   planted. As Pipo's death appears unprovoked, the Pequeninos are now
   considered a threat by the Starways Congress and restrictions on
   studying them are tightened. Distraught, Novinha makes a call for a
   Speaker for the Dead for Pipo. She is in love with Libo but fears that
   if he sees her files of research he will make the same discovery as
   Pipo and meet the same fate. She marries another colonist, Marcos
   Ribeira, so as to lock her files from being opened.

   Andrew Wiggin, unbeknownst by the other colonists to be the Ender
   Wiggin responsible for the Formic xenocide, lives innocuously on the
   planet Trondheim. He responds to Novinha's call, parting with his
   sister, Valentine, who has traveled with him but is now settled with a
   family. He travels with an artificial intelligence named Jane who
   communicates with Ender through a jewel earring; she was born of in the
   Ansible network that enables faster-than-light communications and keeps
   her existence secret. After relativistic travel, Ender arrives at
   Lusitania 22 years later (1970 S.C.), finding that Novinha canceled her
   request for a Speaker five days after sending it. In the intervening
   time, Libo died in the same manner as Pipo and Marcos succumbed to a
   chronic illness. Novinha's eldest children, Ela and Miro, have
   requested a Speaker for Libo and Marcos. Ender, gaining access to all
   of the appropriate files, learns of tension since Pipo's death: Novinha
   has turned away from xenobiology to study crop growth and had a
   loveless relationship with Marcos; Miro has secretly worked with Libo's
   daughter Ouanda to continue to study the Pequeninos, breaking the law
   to share human technology and knowledge with them. Over the course of
   time, Miro and Ouanda have fallen in love. With Ender's arrival, Miro
   tells him that one of the Pequeninos, Human, has taken a great interest
   in Ender, and Ender becomes aware that Human can hear messages from the
   Formic Hive Queen. Ender discovers that Marcos was infertile: all six
   of Novinha's children were fathered by Libo, Ender also learns what
   Pipo had seen in Novinha's data.

   As word of Miro's and Ouanda's illegal sharing of human technology with
   the Pequeninos is reported to Congress, Ender secretly meets with the
   Pequeninos. They know his true identity and they implore him to help
   them be part of civilization, while the Formic Queen tells Ender that
   Lusitania would be an ideal place to restart the hive, as her race can
   help guide the Pequeninos. By the time Ender returns to the colony,
   Congress has ordered Miro and Ouanda to be sent off-planet for penal
   action and the colony to be disbanded. Ender delivers his eulogy for
   Marcos, revealing Novinha's infidelity. Miro, distraught to learn that
   he is Ouanda's half-brother, attempts to escape to the Pequeninos, but
   he suffers neurological damage as he tries to cross the electrified
   fence. Ender reveals to the colony what Pipo learned: that every life
   form on Lusitania is paired with another through the Descolada virus,
   so that the death of one births the other. In the case of the
   Pequeninos, they become trees when they die. The colony leaders agree
   to rebel against Congress, severing their Ansible connection and
   deactivating the fence, allowing Ender, Ouanda, and Ela to go with
   Human to speak to the Pequenino wives, to help establish a case to
   present to Congress.

   The Pequenino wives help Ender corroborate the complex life cycle of
   the Pequeninos, affirming that the death ritual Pipo observed was to
   help create "fathertrees" who fertilize the Pequenino females to
   continue their race. The Pequeninos believed they were honoring Pipo,
   and later Libo, by helping them become fathertrees, but Ender explains
   that humans lack this "third life", and if the Pequeninos are to
   cohabitate with humans, they must respect this difference. To affirm
   their understanding and agreement, Ender is asked to perform the ritual
   of giving Human "third life" as a fathertree.

   Miro recovers from most of the physical damage from his encounter with
   the fence, but he is partially paralyzed; Ender transfers Jane to him,
   and she becomes Miro's companion. Valentine and her family decide to
   travel from Trondheim to Lusitania to help with the revolt and will
   arrive in some decades due to relativistic travel; Ender has Miro meet
   them halfway. Novinha finally absolves herself of her guilt for the
   death of Pipo and Libo. She and Ender marry. Ender plants the Hive
   Queen as per her request, and he writes his third book, a biography of
   the life of the Pequenino, Human.
