   Sigsbee Manderson, a wealthy American plutocrat, is found shot dead in
   the grounds of his English country house "White Gables", in the village
   of Marlstone, on the south-west coast of England. Philip Trent, an
   artist, freelance journalist, and amateur detective, is commissioned by
   Sir James Molloy, a Fleet Street press magnate, to investigate and
   report on the case. Trent receives the co-operation of the police (the
   investigating officer proves to be Inspector Murch of Scotland Yard, an
   old acquaintance), and is able to view the body, examine the house and
   grounds, and interview those involved. Other members of the household
   include Manderson's wife, Mabel; his two secretaries (Calvin Bunner, an
   American, and John Marlowe, an Englishman); Martin, a manservant; and
   Celestine, a lady's maid. Nathaniel Cupples, Mabel Manderson's
   uncle-by-marriage and another old friend of Trent, is staying at a
   hotel in the village.

   Trent pursues his enquiries, and learns, among other things, that the
   Mandersons' marriage was in difficulties, and that the couple had grown
   distant from each other. In the process, he falls in love with Mabel
   Manderson. The coroner's inquest finds that Manderson was killed by a
   person or persons unknown: there is a strong suggestion that he was the
   victim of a business vendetta. Trent, however, concludes that Manderson
   was shot by Marlowe, who then returned to the house wearing some of
   Manderson's outer clothing in order to give the impression that
   Manderson was at that point still alive, before driving to Southampton
   to provide himself with an alibi. Trent believes that Marlowe's motive
   was his own love for Mabel, but is unclear as to how far she may have
   colluded in the affair. He writes down his ideas in the form of a
   dispatch for Molloy, but before sending it presents it to Mabel and
   asks whether there had been anything between her and Marlowe. Her
   reaction persuades him that there had been, and he leaves the dispatch
   unsent.

   Six months later (having spent the intervening period in Latvia as a
   roving correspondent for Molloy) Trent re-establishes contact with
   Mabel in London, and finally extracts her version of events. She tells
   him that there had never been any sort of intimacy between her and
   Marlowe, but that her husband's suspicions had been the cause of their
   marital rift, and that in his jealousy he may have plotted an act of
   revenge. Trent now sends Marlowe his original dispatch, and arranges a
   meeting, at which Cupples is also present, to allow Marlowe to give his
   side of the story. Marlowe explains that Manderson had fabricated a web
   of incriminating evidence to implicate Marlowe in his apparent
   "murder", and send him to the gallows; and had then shot himself.
   Having realised what was happening, and having discovered Manderson's
   body, Marlowe had attempted to cover his tracks and give himself an
   alibi - this much of Trent's analysis had been correct.

   Following this meeting, Trent and Cupples have dinner together, at
   which Cupples reveals - in the final pages of the book - that, while
   the majority of Marlowe's story had been accurate, it was in fact he
   who had fired the fatal shot. He had chanced upon Manderson pointing a
   pistol at himself, probably meaning only to cause a self-inflicted
   wound. However, suspecting a suicide attempt, Cupples had intervened,
   and in the ensuing struggle had shot Manderson in the face.

   On the last page, Trent vows that he will never again attempt to dabble
   in crime detection.
