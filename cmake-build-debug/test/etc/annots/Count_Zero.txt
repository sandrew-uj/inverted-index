   Seven years after the events of Neuromancer, strange things begin to
   happen in the Matrix, leading to the proliferation of what appear to be
   voodoo gods (hinted to be the fractured remains of the joined AIs that
   were Neuromancer and Wintermute).

   Two powerful multinational corporations, Maas Biolabs and Hosaka, are
   engaged in a battle for control over a powerful new technology (a
   biochip), using hackers and the Matrix as well as espionage and
   violence.
