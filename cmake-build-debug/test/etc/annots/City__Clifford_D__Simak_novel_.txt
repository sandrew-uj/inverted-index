   The fixup^[1] novel describes a legend consisting of eight tales that
   the pastoral, pacifist Dogs recite as they pass down an oral legend of
   a creature known as Man. Each tale is preceded by doggish notes and
   learned discussion.

   An editor's preface notes that after each telling of the legend the
   pups ask many questions:

          "What is Man?" they'll ask.
          Or perhaps: "What is a city?"
          Or: "What is a war?"
          There is no positive answer to any of these questions.
