   The plot opens with a faux email addressed to Nigel MacDonald, listing
   a job offer. It is later learned that this email is for a work-at-home
   programmer position at Hayek Associates PLC.

   It is then learned that a cybercrime has been committed in the
   massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Avalon Four. A
   robbery of several thousand euros worth of "prestige items" occurs in
   the game's central bank, led by a band of orcs and a "dragon for fire
   support." It is later noticed that this seemingly simple incident has
   deep implications - both financial (Hayek stock price) and logistical
   (compromised cryptographic keys), which sets the stage for the latter
   half of the novel.

   The main story is then divided between police chapters as Sue,
   investigation sections as Elaine, and programmer and gamer geek
   sections as Jack. Initially separate storylines, the three inevitably
   join forces to combat a much larger conspiracy that hinges on
   international espionage and counterterrorism. These initial segments
   track the bank robbery and mystery man, Nigel MacDonald, who is
   revealed as a shadow identity created from Jack Reed's credentials as a
   programmer and gamer.

   Eventually, it is discovered that the entirety of the European network
   backbone--including its root keyservers--has been compromised by
   Chinese hackers. It is more or less at this point that the wool is
   removed from the reader's eyes that "it's no longer a game," while Jack
   and Elaine develop a romance between action segments.

   Using the game Spooks as a sock puppet for real espionage missions,
   Jack and Elaine are sent to uncover the identity of a mole inside Hayek
   Associates, which is subsequently revealed to be a front for the
   government. The mole is said to have leaked cryptographic keys to "Team
   Red", or Chinese interests, through a blacknet. For contrast, the
   European protagonists are called simply, "Team Blue".

   It is at this point that the stage is set for the final confrontation.
   Using Nigel's shadow identity as bait for Team Red's mole, Elaine and
   Jack successfully expose and capture Marcus Hackman, who is revealed to
   be the mole and main antagonist. It is then revealed that Hackman had
   staged the whole thing to use strategic put options to earn EUR26
   million when his own company, Hayek Associates, took the fall for the
   initial robbery sequence.

   Jack is shot twice in the chest during this exchange, but is seen
   recovering in a hospital bed by the end of the book.

   The novel closes with an email addressed to Hackman that resembles a
   419 scam from a Nigerian banker, implying that is where he hid the
   money.
