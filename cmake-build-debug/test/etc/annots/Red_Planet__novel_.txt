   The novel takes place in a future when Mars has been colonized by
   humans, but is governed by an administrator appointed by an Earth-based
   company - the colonists have no political power. On Mars, colonial
   teenagers Jim Marlowe and Frank Sutton travel to the Lowell Academy
   boarding school for the start of the academic year. Jim takes along his
   native Martian pet, Willis the Bouncer, a round furry ball the size of
   a volleyball, who is about as intelligent as a human child and has a
   photographic memory for sounds, which he can also reproduce perfectly.
   At a rest stop, Willis wanders off and encounters one of the adult
   sentient Martians. The three-legged alien takes the two boys and Willis
   to join a ritual called "growing together" with a group of its fellows.
   They also share water, making Jim and Frank "water friends" with the
   Martian, named Gekko.

   At school, Jim gets into trouble with the authoritarian headmaster, Mr.
   Howe, who confiscates Willis, claiming that it is against the new rules
   to have pets. When Jim and Frank sneak into Howe's office and rescue
   Willis, the bouncer repeats two overheard conversations between Howe
   and Beecher, the unscrupulous colonial administrator of Mars, detailing
   Beecher's plans for Willis and for the colony. When Beecher learns Howe
   has a bouncer, he is ecstatic, since the London Zoo is willing to pay a
   hefty price for a specimen. Worse, Beecher has secretly planned to
   prevent the annual migration of the colonists (to avoid 12 months of
   severe winter weather) in order to save money. The boys run away from
   school to warn their parents and the colony.

   The boys set out to skate the thousands of miles on the frozen Martian
   canals to their homes. During the trip, Frank gets sick. On the third
   night, they are forced to take shelter inside a giant Martian
   cabbage-plant (nearly suffocating when it folds up at night). The next
   day they meet some native Martians, who accept Jim because of his
   relationship to Willis and water-friendship with Gekko. The Martians
   treat Frank's illness and send the two boys home by a swift subway.

   Once warned, Jim's father quickly organizes the migration, hoping to
   catch Beecher off guard. The colonists reach and take over the boarding
   school, turning it into a temporary shelter. Howe locks himself in his
   office, while Beecher sets up automatic, photosensor-controlled weapons
   outside to stop the malcontents (as he calls them) from leaving. After
   two colonists are killed trying to surrender, and the power to the
   building is cut, the colonists decide they have no choice but to fight
   back. The colonists organize a raiding party, with the boys taking
   part, capture Beecher's office and proclaim the colony's independence
   from Earth.

   Several Martians enter the school area, and one of them shows up in the
   door leading to Howe's office, hiding him from sight. When the Martian
   turns away, Howe is nowhere to be found. The Martians then go to
   Beecher's building, and when they leave, he has also vanished. The
   Martians had been content to allow humans to share their planet, but
   Beecher's threat to Willis has made them reconsider. They present the
   colonists with an ultimatum: leave the planet or else. Dr. MacRae
   negotiates with the Martians, and succeeds in persuading them to let
   the colonists stay, mainly because of Jim's strong friendship with
   Willis.

   MacRae theorizes that Martians start life as bouncers, metamorphose
   into adults, then continue to exist after their deaths as the "old
   ones". In the end, Jim resigns himself to giving Willis up so the
   bouncer can undergo the transformation to adulthood.

   As with Podkayne of Mars, there are two versions of the ending. As
   originally written (and published much later) it is made clear that
   Willis will not emerge as an adult for forty years. Heinlein's
   publishers edited and changed this, as well as a discussion early in
   the novel in which MacRae expresses strong support for adults and older
   children being free to carry handguns, and opposition to any government
   which would restrict that.
