   "The Artist of the Beautiful" follows Owen Warland as he works on an
   unknown project. The story begins with Peter Hovenden, a retired
   watchmaker and Owen's former master, walking by with his daughter
   Annie. Peter scoffs at Owen for working on something other than a
   watch, and tells his daughter that the more practical work of the
   blacksmith Robert Danforth is more admirable. Working with such
   strength, Peter believes, "takes the nonsense out of a man." Owen has
   overheard this conversation and wonders if Annie agrees with her
   father.

   Robert presents Owen with a tiny anvil he had requested and the two
   briefly discuss the differences between practical work and more
   ambitious work. Resuming his project, Owen finds himself affected by
   Robert's practical-mindedness and unintentionally ruins his work. In
   despair, Owen put the project aside and begins to focus on his
   watchmaking, becoming well-respected in town. In the midst of this
   success, Peter returns to the shop and sees that Owen has resumed work
   on his secret invention. He threatens to destroy it, which he believes
   will be helping him. Owen shouts at him and curses the "coarse world"
   that does not appreciate his work. Months later, Annie visits and asks
   him to repair a thimble of hers. Owen, for a moment, thinks she is the
   one person who might understand his work, but changes his mind when she
   accidentally breaks his small machine.

   Owen breaks from society for a time and finds his nourishment in nature
   and in chasing butterflies. Peter returns to invite him to a
   celebration for the engagement of his daughter to Robert Danforth. Owen
   secretly loves Annie and is despondent for a time but, once his spirits
   revive, he returns to his project with vigor. Years pass before he
   visits Robert and Annie at their home. He offers his invention to Annie
   as a late wedding gift and instructs her to open an extravagantly
   decorated box. Inside is a small butterfly which lands on her finger.
   She is unsure if it is real or a machine. Her child reaches for the
   butterfly but he has inherited his father's strength and his
   grandfather's skepticism and the butterfly is crushed in his small
   hands. Owen is not upset because he had already achieved his goal as
   the artist of the beautiful; the butterfly itself was only the physical
   manifestation of that symbol.
