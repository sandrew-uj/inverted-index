   The Hindmost, recently deposed leader of the Puppeteers, abducts the
   human Louis Wu (who has become a wirehead) and kzin Chmeee (previously
   known as "Speaker-to-Animals"). Both had been part of the original
   Ringworld expedition. The Hindmost hopes to acquire Ringworld
   technology, specifically matter transmutation, to help him regain his
   position.

   Once they reach the Ringworld, Louis and Chmeee are sent out to
   explore, while the Hindmost remains safely behind on their starship.
   Louis and Chmeee secretly plot to try to overthrow the Hindmost so they
   can go home. In their travels, they meet a number of the hominid
   species that have evolved on the Ringworld. They also learn more about
   the full-scale "maps" of various known space worlds, including Earth,
   Mars and Kzin.

   They discover that the Ringworld has become unstable and will collide
   with its star soon. The Ringworld's builders, revealed to be Pak
   Protectors, have long since died out, and the attitude jets they
   installed all around the rim to maintain the Ringworld's position were
   dismounted to use as starship engines. Chmeee goes to the Kzin map for
   his own goals, while Louis tries to find some way to save the trillions
   of inhabitants.

   It is on the Map of Mars that the reunited party (and two natives)
   finds the Ringworld control room Louis is seeking, located in a vast
   maze of rooms in the hollow space under the map. To create the rarefied
   atmosphere on Mars, the Map of Mars was built 20 miles (32 km) above
   the main surface, creating a 1,120,000,000-cubic-mile (4.7 *10^9 km^3)
   cavity. The control room contains living space and, among other things,
   the meteor defense system. The defense system uses the superconductor
   grid embedded in the Ringworld's scrith floor to manipulate the
   magnetic field of the Ringworld's sun to trigger stellar flares that
   power a titanic gas laser. (The first expedition to the Ringworld
   crashed after being hit by this laser.)

   They encounter Teela Brown, a human member of the first expedition who
   had chosen to remain on Ringworld. She and her lover Seeker had, in the
   course of their travels, stumbled upon "Tree-of-Life" plants. The smell
   of the plant drove them to eat its roots; Teela was turned into a Pak
   Protector, with superhuman intelligence and strength, but Seeker died,
   being too old to undergo the transformation. As a Pak Protector, Teela
   has little control of her actions; her protective instincts force her
   to try to save all of the Ringworld inhabitants. This causes a dilemma.
   She knows of a way to save the Ringworld, but it would entail killing
   5% of the people. This she cannot do. She manages to lure Louis and the
   others to where they can save the other 95%. Her instincts make her
   fight them, but she does so half-heartedly so that they can kill her.

   Afterward, Louis figures out what to do. Teela had restored starship
   engines to their original purpose as attitude jets, but only had enough
   for 5% of the ring. Louis explains that the meteor defense system can
   generate a massive stellar flare (normally used to power the laser
   weapon) to provide twenty times more fuel to the attitude jets to move
   the Ringworld back into position. However, the radiation from the flare
   will be fatal to everything and everyone living on that section of the
   Ringworld. The actual task is carried out by the Hindmost, who is far
   superior at operating the control systems (and can safely pass through
   a Tree-of-Life plantation en route to the control center, as Louis
   cannot).

   Having earlier destroyed the hyperdrive to force the Hindmost to
   cooperate, Louis is stranded. He and the rest of his party look for
   some place to settle down, while the Hindmost remains aboard the
   disabled (but very safe) starship to think things over.
