   The story is set in "Women's Country", apparently in the former Pacific
   Northwest. They have evolved in the direction of
   Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy based on small cities and
   low-tech local agriculture. They have also developed a matriarchy where
   the women and children live within town walls with a small number of
   male servitors, and most of the men live outside the town in warrior
   camps.
