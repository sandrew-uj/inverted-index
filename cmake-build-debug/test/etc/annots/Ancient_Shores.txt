   A vast lake, known as Lake Agassiz, covered much of North Dakota,
   Manitoba and Minnesota during prehistoric times.

   The story begins when farmer Tom Lasker and his son, Will, uncover a
   seemingly brand new yacht. Found on a landlocked farm, it draws
   tourists to the area. Max Collingswood, a friend of Tom's, tries to
   help discover the origins of the boat. Collingswood enlists April
   Cannon, a worker at a chemical lab who discovers that the yacht is made
   of an unknown material. In fact, it is a fiberglass-like material with
   an impossible atomic number (161).

   Collingswood and Cannon discover something else on a nearby ridge which
   is part of a Sioux reservation. The Sioux assist in its excavation and
   examination. It turns out to be a green glassy roundhouse-like
   structure, made from the same material.

   Eventually, they gain access to it, revealing a dock for the sailboat,
   but no entrance for it. The discovery that the structure contains the
   means to access other sites not on Earth sets off a struggle between
   the Government and the Reservation for control of it.
