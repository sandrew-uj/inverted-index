   The City and the Stars is a science fiction novel by British writer
   Arthur C. Clarke, published in 1956. This novel is a complete rewrite
   of his earlier Against the Fall of Night, Clarke's first novel, which
   had been published in Startling Stories magazine in 1948 after John W.
   Campbell, Jr., editor of Astounding Science-Fiction, had rejected it,
   according to Clarke.

   Several years later, Clarke revised his novel extensively and renamed
   it The City and the Stars. The new version was intended to showcase
   what he had learned about writing, and about information processing.
   The major differences are in individual scenes and in the details of
   his contrasting civilizations of Diaspar and Lys. Against the Fall of
   Night remained popular enough to stay in print after The City and the
   Stars had been published. In introductions to it Clarke has told the
   anecdote of a psychiatrist and patient who admitted that they had
   discussed it one day in therapy, without realizing at the time that one
   had read one novel and one the other.
