   The events of the comic begin shortly after the events of Sonic
   Forces, in which Doctor Eggman has gone missing following his
   defeat by the Resistance, but the remnants of his Badnik army continue
   to attack around the world. After the robot attacks suddenly become
   more coordinated, Sonic, while investigating the cause, discovers that
   Eggman has sustained amnesia and taken on the friendly persona of "Mr.
   Tinker" in the village that found him. After observing Mr. Tinker's
   work, Sonic decides he is truly reformed, although he has to convince
   Shadow of the same. It is revealed that Metal Sonic is leading the
   Eggman Empire in his master's absence, intending to eventually restore
   Eggman to his proper place. He conquers Angel Island, where the heroes
   fight him. Metal Sonic with the Master Emerald assumes a Super Mode,
   then uses his biodata to transform into the stronger Master Overlord.
   Through a combined effort by the Resistance and their allies, Metal
   Sonic is thwarted and Angel Island liberated. In the aftermath,
   Knuckles disbands the Resistance, which Amy later reorganizes into the
   "Restoration".

   Meanwhile, Mr. Tinker is kidnapped by two criminals, Rough and Tumble,
   at the behest of a new villain: Dr. Starline, a platypus who has become
   enamored by Eggman's work. With some help from Metal Sonic, Dr.
   Starline restores Eggman's memories, being rewarded with a position as
   the doctor's head assistant. Eggman then develops the Metal Virus, a
   contagion that turns organic material to machines under his control,
   and prepares to unleash it on the world from his new "Faceship" flying
   base. He tricks Rough and Tumble into infecting themselves during a
   battle with Sonic and Amy; the hedgehogs defeat the newly coined
   "Zombots", but Sonic is infected in the process.

   In the Tangle & Whisper miniseries, Tangle finds Whisper chasing after
   who appears to be Sonic, revealing to be a shapeshifting octopus named
   Mimic. She offers to help her track down Mimic, in which Whisper
   reluctantly accepts. After being nearly killed by Mimic's bombs while
   investigating, Whisper shares her backstory and explanation of her
   trauma in which she and Mimic were part of a mercenary group named the
   Diamond Cutters, and Mimic betrayed and helped Eggman kill the rest of
   her team in a trap. Tangle and Whisper then find and successfully
   defeat Mimic, but Tangle dissuades Whisper from killing him, not
   wanting her to do what Mimic has done to her team. After imprisoning
   Mimic, Tangle and Whisper separate paths, but promise to meet again
   soon.

   As Eggman spreads the Metal Virus across the world, Sonic learns that
   he can keep his infection at bay by running. Eventually, however, his
   speed loses its ability to counter the virus, as revealed by Cream the
   Rabbit's robot aide, Gemerl. Sonic and his allies find themselves
   powerless against the virus despite their best efforts; most of them
   become Zombots and E-123 Omega is nearly destroyed fighting the hordes.
   With only Angel Island still unaffected, Knuckles allows the
   demoralized survivors to take shelter there. Eventually, the virus
   mutates beyond Eggman's control, having been unleashed in an imperfect
   state. Starline, disillusioned, secretly recruits the Deadly Six to
   regain control of the Zombots. Aware of their grudge against Eggman and
   Sonic after the events of Sonic Lost World, Starline tries to control
   them with a Cacophonic Conch after warping them aboard the Faceship;
   however, his lungs give out, rendering the conch useless. The Zeti soon
   chase Eggman, Starline, and Metal Sonic out of the Faceship, then steal
   the Chaos Emeralds on board and plot to conquer and terrorize the
   world. Rouge, who recently infiltrated the ship, witnesses the Zeti
   leader, Zavok, commandeer it and secretly notifies the Restoration.
   Forced into a truce with Sonic and company, Eggman and Metal Sonic fire
   Starline and confiscate his portal-generating Warp Topaz, stating that
   combining its power with the Chaos Emeralds' can eradicate the virus.

   Joined by the Babylon Rogues, the Restoration splits up to confront
   each Zeti simultaneously and claim their Chaos Emeralds, while Sonic
   remains behind to slow his Metal Virus infection using a treadmill. At
   sunset, Zavok discovers Angel Island, but Rouge steals the emerald
   powering the Faceship, causing it to crash. An enraged Zavok morphs
   into a giant and sets Sonic's infected allies on the survivors, but
   Sonic and Silver manage to claim the final emerald, and their
   transformation into Super Sonic and Super Silver cures the former.
   After defeating Zavok, Sonic and Silver cure the world and destroy the
   Metal Virus by sending it through a portal to the sun. Everyone happily
   reunites, but as Starline had forewarned, the emeralds' power overloads
   the Warp Topaz, and it explodes before Sonic can dispose of it through
   the portal, teleporting him to the Sol Dimension where Blaze lives. In
   his absence, Silver returns to the future and the world starts to
   recover from the plague, while Eggman and his robots return to their
   normal plans of villainy. Eventually, an amnesiac Sonic has his
   memories restored and returns to his home dimension.

   In the Bad Guys miniseries, Starline, planning to conquer the world and
   surpass Eggman to regain his respect, breaks into a prison and frees
   Eggman's former assistants, Rough, Tumble, Mimic, and Zavok, to recruit
   them for his plan. As part of the plan, they raid one of Eggman's
   bases for the Power Cores, artifacts which amplifies one's ability.
   Fearing the other villains are too dangerous to let free, Starline
   plans to kill them after he has finished using them, but Mimic and
   Zavok learn of his deceit. After raiding another of Eggman's bases, the
   two turn on Starline, expose him to Rough and Tumble, and force him to
   erase Mimic's Eggnet data, preventing Eggman from tracking the
   shapeshifter. Starline escapes using his new Tricore, which can
   amplify multiple abilities at once, and the villains part ways, with
   Zavok planning to reunite with his group and Starline planning to
   conquer the world for himself, disavowing Eggman entirely.

   To rebuild the still-damaged Omega, Sonic and Tails search one of
   Eggman's abandoned bases, while Amy, Rouge, and Cream compete in Chao
   races to obtain parts from a champion Chao racer known as Clutch.
   Shadow, who is in the area, discovers that Clutch is abusive to his
   losing Chao, locking them up in a cage, prompting Rouge's team to
   devise a rescue plan. Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails come across a wooden
   marionette-like robot named Belle, who accompanies them to Clutch's
   residence at a mountain chateau. As Clutch unleashes his collection of
   Badniks on the group and escapes, a hooded figure, who turns out to be
   Starline, kidnaps Tails and Rouge to experiment on them and triggers an
   avalanche to distract Sonic and Shadow. Belle frees the captive Chao,
   who help the girls and Gemerl defeat the Badniks. Starline confronts
   Tails and attempts to kidnap him again, but fails and takes the full
   force of the avalanche. Omega is successfully fixed thanks to Belle's
   reading of Eggman blueprints, which leaves Tails suspicious. Unknown to
   them, Starline has taken a sample of Tails' fur, which he deems enough
   for his new plans.

   Seeking a new home for Belle, Sonic and Tails introduce her to the
   Restoration, now led by Tangle's childhood friend, Jewel the Beetle.
   Thereafter, Sonic, Tails, and Amy go to investigate a tower Eggman has
   built out in the ocean, but become lost upon breaking in. They discover
   the tower is a Badnik testing facility with spatial warping properties.
   As the trio try to escape, Eggman discovers their intrusion and traps
   them. Meanwhile, Belle meets Tangle, who takes a liking to and
   befriends her. Tangle and Belle soon launch their own investigation of
   the tower, learning Belle is a Badnik along the way. By interrogating
   Orbot and Cubot, Tangle finds Sonic, Tails, and Amy and rescues them,
   overloading one of the tower's warp gates in the process.
   Simultaneously, Belle learns to her dismay that Eggman created her
   while he was Mr. Tinker. Sonic and co., along with Orbot and Cubot,
   escape before the compromised warp gate implodes the tower. As the
   group heads home, a gloomy Belle comes clean to her friends about her
   origins and is consoled by Tangle.
