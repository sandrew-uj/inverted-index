   Quicksilver is a historical novel by Neal Stephenson, published in
   2003. It is the first volume of The Baroque Cycle, his late Baroque
   historical fiction series, succeeded by The Confusion and The System of
   the World (both published in 2004). Quicksilver won the Arthur C.
   Clarke Award and was nominated for the Locus Award in 2004.
   Stephenson organized the structure of Quicksilver such that chapters
   have been incorporated into three internal books titled "Quicksilver",
   "The King of the Vagabonds", and "Odalisque". In 2006, each internal
   book was released in separate paperback editions, to make the 900 pages
   more approachable for readers. These internal books were originally
   independent novels within the greater cycle during composition.

   The novel Quicksilver is written in various narrative styles, such as
   theatrical staging and epistolary, and follows a large group of
   characters. Though mostly set in England, France, and the United
   Provinces in the period 1655 through 1673, the first book includes a
   frame story set in late 1713 Massachusetts. In order to write the
   novel, Stephenson researched the period extensively and integrates
   events and historical themes important to historical scholarship
   throughout the novel. However, Stephenson alters details such as the
   members of the Cabal ministry, the historical cabinet of Charles II of
   England, to facilitate the incorporation of his fictional characters.
   Within the historical context, Stephenson also deals with many themes
   which pervade his other works, including the exploration of knowledge,
   communication and cryptography.

   The plot of the first and third books focus on Daniel Waterhouse's
   exploits as a natural philosopher and friend to the young Isaac Newton
   and his later observations of English politics and religion,
   respectively. The second book introduces the vagabond Jack Shaftoe
   ("King of the Vagabonds") and Eliza (a former member of a Turkish
   harem) as they cross Europe, eventually landing in the Netherlands,
   where Eliza becomes entangled in commerce and politics. Quicksilver
   operates in the same fictional universe as Stephenson's earlier novel
   Cryptonomicon, in which descendants of Quicksilver characters Shaftoe
   and Waterhouse appear prominently.
