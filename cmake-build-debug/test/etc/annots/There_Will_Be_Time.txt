   Jack Havig was born in the American midwest in 1933 with a genetic
   mutation that allows him to travel through time. He learns that an
   apocalypse will occur sometime in the 21st century due to
   over-pollution and nuclear warfare. Farther still in the future, a New
   Zealand/Micronesian culture known as "the Maurai Federation" will
   eventually dominate the world and impose their vision of a less
   industrialized, more ecologically balanced world. Jack reasons that
   there must be others born with the same innate ability to travel
   through time. In his initial search for them, he visits Jerusalem at
   the time of the Crucifixion. Jack is discovered by other time-travelers
   who are agents of a time-traveling organization called the "Eyrie,"
   that is based in the far future and is led by a racist man born in 19th
   century United States. Initially Jack joins the group, but eventually
   rebels against them when he discovers and experiences first hand the
   extent of the Eyrie's rampant brutality and inhumanity as they attempt
   to achieve their goal of stopping the Maurai ascendancy. To defeat the
   Eyrie, Jack returns to the 20th century and devises a plan of his own
   to recruit time-travelers and create a "tribe" that will return to the
   future to destroy the Eyrie.

   Much of the story takes place in various times of the past, present,
   and future, including an extended interlude where Jack is sent on a
   mission by the Eyrie to medieval Constantinople; where he saves the
   life of a Greek girl during the carnage of the Fourth Crusade and
   eventually marries her.

   The future depicted in the book is the same as in Anderson's Maurai
   cycle.
