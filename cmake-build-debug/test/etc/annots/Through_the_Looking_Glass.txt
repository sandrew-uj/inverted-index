   Chapter One - Looking-Glass House: Alice is playing with a white kitten
   (whom she calls "Snowdrop") and a black kitten (whom she calls "Kitty")
   when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's
   reflection. Climbing up onto the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the
   wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise,
   that she is able to step through it to an alternative world. In this
   reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass
   poetry, "Jabberwocky", whose reversed printing she can read only by
   holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces
   have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.

   Chapter Two - The Garden of Live Flowers: Upon leaving the house (where
   it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden
   where the flowers can speak; they perceive Alice as being a "flower
   that can move about". Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red
   Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability
   to run at breathtaking speeds.

   Chapter Three - Looking-Glass Insects: The Red Queen reveals to Alice
   that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic
   chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the
   way to the eighth rank/row in a chess match. Alice is placed in the
   second rank as one of the White Queen's pawns, and begins her journey
   across the chessboard by boarding a train that jumps over the third row
   and directly into the fourth rank, thus acting on the rule that pawns
   can advance two spaces on their first move. She arrives in a forest
   where a depressed gnat teaches her about the looking glass insects,
   strange creatures part bug part object (e.g., bread and butterfly,
   rocking horse fly), before flying away sadly. Alice continues her
   journey and along the way, crosses the "wood where things have no
   names". There she forgets all nouns, including her own name. With the
   help of a fawn who has also forgotten his identity, she makes it to the
   other side, where they both remember everything. Realizing that he is a
   fawn, she is a human, and that fawns are afraid of humans, it runs off
   (to Alice's frustration).

   Chapter Four - Tweedledum and Tweedledee: She then meets the fat twin
   brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, whom she knows from the nursery
   rhyme. After reciting the long poem "The Walrus and the Carpenter",
   they draw Alice's attention to the Red King--loudly snoring away under
   a nearby tree--and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical
   banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the Red King's
   dreams. Finally, the brothers begin suiting up for battle, only to be
   frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them
   predicts.

   Chapter Five - Wool and Water: Alice next meets the White Queen, who is
   very absent-minded but boasts of (and demonstrates) her ability to
   remember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White
   Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a brook
   together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms
   into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself
   struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep
   annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about "crabs" and
   "feathers".

   Chapter Six - Humpty Dumpty: After crossing yet another brook into the
   sixth rank, Alice immediately encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides
   celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange
   terms in "Jabberwocky". In the process, he introduces Alice to the
   concept of portmanteau words, before his inevitable fall.
   The White Knight

   Chapter Seven - The Lion and the Unicorn: "All the king's horses and
   all the king's men" come to Humpty Dumpty's assistance, and are
   accompanied by the White King, along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who
   again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting with each other.
   In this chapter, the March Hare and Hatter of the first book make a
   brief re-appearance in the guise of "Anglo-Saxon messengers" called
   "Haigha" and "Hatta".

   Chapter Eight - "It's my own Invention": Upon leaving the Lion and
   Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing
   another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who is
   intent on capturing the "white pawn"--Alice--until the White Knight
   comes to her rescue. Escorting her through the forest towards the final
   brook-crossing, the Knight recites a long poem of his own composition
   called Haddocks' Eyes, and repeatedly falls off his horse.

   Chapter Nine - Queen Alice: Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice
   steps across the last brook, and is automatically crowned a queen, with
   the crown materialising abruptly on her head (a reference to pawn
   promotion). She soon finds herself in the company of both the White and
   Red Queens, who relentlessly confound Alice by using word play to
   thwart her attempts at logical discussion. They then invite one another
   to a party that will be hosted by the newly crowned Alice--of which
   Alice herself had no prior knowledge.

   Chapter Ten - Shaking: Alice arrives and seats herself at her own
   party, which quickly turns into chaos. Alice finally grabs the Red
   Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day's nonsense, and
   begins shaking her.

   Chapter Eleven - Waking: Alice awakes in her armchair to find herself
   holding the black kitten, who she deduces to have been the Red Queen
   all along, with the white kitten having been the White Queen.

   Chapter Twelve - Which dreamed it?: The story ends with Alice recalling
   the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have been
   a dream of the Red King, and that Alice might herself be no more than a
   figment of his imagination. The book ends with the line "Life, what is
   it but a dream?"
