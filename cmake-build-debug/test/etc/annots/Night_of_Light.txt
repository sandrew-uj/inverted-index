   Once every seven years, a world in orbit around a binary star is bathed
   in a bizarre radiance that rearranges physical reality. Most of the
   planet's inhabitants choose to sleep for the entire two-week period,
   often using a special medicine to do so. Only mystics, newcomers, and
   devotees to the planet's bizarre religion are willing to stay awake and
   endure the two weeks of brilliance, where things materialize out of
   thin air. According to their religion, people undergo an unpredictable
   change, and many actually die. The good become better, and the bad
   become worse. One woman's husband metamorphosized into a tree. Another
   person was chased down streets by statues that came to life. But facing
   the brilliance is also a rite of passage if you must develop as a being
   inclined towards acts of goodness, or a being inclined towards acts of
   evil. It is during those two weeks that the good are pitted against the
   bad, and it is also a time when their living god must face his
   successor.

   To help in the conversion effort, Catholic missionaries have been sent
   to the planet to help reconcile the planet's religion with their own
   universal faith. The only problem is that the planet's religion appears
   to be spreading across the stars.
