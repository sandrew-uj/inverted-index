   Eighteen hundred years in the future, two infantrymen clash on a
   battlefield. A random energy weapon strikes both, and they are hurled
   into a time vortex. While one soldier is trapped in the matrix of time,
   the other, Qarlo Clobregnny (Michael Ansara), materializes on a city
   street in the United States in the year 1964.

   Qarlo is soon captured and interrogated by Tom Kagan (Lloyd Nolan), a
   philologist, and his origin is eventually discovered. Qarlo has been
   trained for one purpose - to kill the enemy, and that is all he knows.
   Progress is made in "taming" him after Kagan translates his seemingly
   unintelligible language - "Nims qarlo clobregnny prite arem aean teaan
   deao" - into colloquial English..."(My) name is Qarlo Clobregnny,
   private, RM EN TN DO"; his name, rank and serial letters, which is what
   any soldier would reveal if captured by the enemy. After a short time
   in captivity, Qarlo comes to live with the Kagan family, despite the
   reluctance expressed by Tom Kagan's government associates.

   However, the time eddy holding the enemy soldier slowly weakens.
   Finally, he materializes fully, and tracks Qarlo to the Kagan home. In
   a final hand-to-hand battle, the soldiers kill each other, but the
   question is posed whether Quarlo sacrifices his life just to kill the
   enemy or to save the Kagan family he has become attached to.
