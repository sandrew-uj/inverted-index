   Ingo is a mermaid who is lost, and she has a flashback of her sister,
   Sapphire (Sapphy) remembering her father, Mathew Trewhella, showing her
   the carved Zennor mermaid, who was slashed with a knife a long time ago
   by an angry human. She had been in love with a human man who eventually
   swam away with her and became Mer.

   By an apparent coincidence, the truant man has exactly the same name as
   Sapphy's father. He is apparently her ancestor. Sapphy is haunted by
   her father's disappearance because he does not come back from the cove
   after an argument with her mother. Many people say he ran away with
   another woman, or has died, but Sapphy and her brother, Conor, who is
   two years older than she is, refuse to give up hope and secretly
   promise to never stop looking for him.

   About a year later, Conor also disappears. Fearing that the same thing
   that happened to her father has happened to Conor, Sapphy sets out to
   look for him. She finds him speaking to a mysterious mergirl named
   Elvira in the water at the nearby cove, and waits until the girl
   suddenly disappears. When asked about the girl, Conor behaves as if she
   were never there, and is shocked (and at first doesn't believe) that
   hours have passed since he went for a "quick" swim.

   The next day, Conor leaves again for the cove after their mother has
   left for work. Searching for him at the cove, Sapphy hears a beautiful
   voice singing a familiar song that her father had sung to her in the
   past. She calls out for her father and the singing stops. Suddenly she
   notices a boy perched on a rock. At first she thinks he is wearing a
   wetsuit pulled down to the waist, but later realises that he actually
   has a seal's tail instead of legs.

   She nearly falls into the sea but the Mer boy, named Faro helps her
   keep her balance. When she calls him a "mermaid", he gets very scornful
   of humans, saying that him being a mermaid is "anatomically impossible"
   as he is, firstly, male and secondly, "all that scaly-tails and
   hair-combing mermaid and merman stuff comes from humans".

   He takes her through the Skin (the surface) and into the world of Ingo
   which is extremely painful at the beginning for a human, and you have
   to forget about Air to be able to survive. She also finds out that it
   works the other way for the Mer: it hurts them when they go into the
   Air, and if they stay to long, they will die. After an amazing time,
   Sapphy leaves Ingo only to realize that she has been there all day long
   instead of a few hours.

   As time goes by, Sapphy is affected more and more by Ingo, craving salt
   and the call of the sea. Ingo calls to Sapphire more strongly than it
   does to Conor. Her brother, worried Sapphire will "disappear," takes
   her to the wise Granny Carne, who imparts her knowledge about Sapphire
   and Connor's Mer heritage. Granny Carne has earth power and can
   communicate with owls and bees, maybe even other animals.

   Roger, a diver and a new boyfriend of Sapphire's mother, plans to go
   diving near the Bawns. Sapphire learns that this is where the Mer go to
   die and Ingo is deeply hostile to anyone who goes there, and that all
   of Ingo is prepared to defend what is held there. She also remembers
   that her father told her and Conor to never ever go near them and that
   it was dangerous.

   Sapphire and Conor do their best to save Roger and his diving buddy,
   Gray, from the fierce seal guardians that protect that area. Conor is
   able to hear the seals' song that they sing to the dying Mer, so he
   sings their song which makes them calm down.

   At first, Faro and Elvira (Faro's sister) do not help, but then realize
   how brave Sapphire and Conor are, so they help them. Sapphire and
   Conor, with Faro and Elvira's help, get Roger and Gray back into the
   boat and cover them with foil blankets. Then, that night as Roger is
   sleeping on the couch, he wakes up screaming from a nightmare, and
   tells Sapphire's mother that he was being thrown by underwater bulls.
   This makes Sapphire realize that the memory of the incident still
   resides in Roger's mind, just below the surface.

   In the last scene, Sapphire works in her father's garden. Her
   neighbor's dog, Sadie, is lying beside her. Suddenly, the air goes
   still and she hears her father's voice saying, "Myrgh Kerenza", Mer for
   "Dear Daughter". Sapphire realises that she is now certain that her
   father is alive and calling to her.
