   "The War of the Worlds" begins with a paraphrase of the beginning of
   the novel, updated to contemporary times. The announcer introduces
   Orson Welles:

     We know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world
     was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and
     yet as mortal as his own. We know now that as human beings busied
     themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and
     studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might
     scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop
     of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the
     earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their
     dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which
     by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of
     Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are
     to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects
     vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes
     and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the 39th year
     of the 20th century came the great disillusionment. It was near the
     end of October. Business was better. The war scare was over. More
     men were back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular
     evening, October 30th, the Crossley service estimated that 32
     million people were listening in on radios...:394-395

   The radio program begins as a simulation of a normal evening radio
   broadcast featuring a weather report and music by "Ramon Raquello and
   His Orchestra" live from a local hotel ballroom. After a few minutes,
   the music begins to be interrupted by several news flashes about
   strange gas explosions on Mars. An interview is arranged with reporter
   Carl Phillips and Princeton-based Professor of Astronomy Richard
   Pierson, who dismisses speculation about life on Mars. The musical
   program returns temporarily but is interrupted again by news of a
   strange meteorite landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Phillips and
   Pierson are dispatched to the site, where a large crowd has gathered.
   Philips describes the chaotic atmosphere around the strange cylindrical
   object, and Pierson admits that he does not know exactly what it is,
   but that it seems to be made of an extraterrestrial metal. The cylinder
   unscrews, and Phillips describes the tentacled, horrific "monster" that
   emerges from inside. Police officers approach the Martian waving a flag
   of truce, but the invaders respond by firing a heat ray, which
   incinerates the delegation and ignites the nearby woods and cars as the
   crowd screams. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off
   mid-sentence, and after a moment of dead air, an announcer explains
   that the remote broadcast was interrupted due to "some difficulty with
   our field transmission."

   After a brief "piano interlude", regular programming breaks down as the
   studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates. A shaken
   Pierson speculates about Martian technology. The New Jersey state
   militia declares martial law and attacks the cylinder; a captain from
   their field headquarters lectures about the overwhelming force of
   properly-equipped infantry and the helplessness of the Martians, until
   a tripod rises from the pit. The tripod obliterates the militia, and
   the studio returns, now describing the Martians as an invading army.
   Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports
   as thousands of refugees clog the highways. Three Martian tripods from
   the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads,
   reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the
   Great Swamp near Morristown, as gas explosions continue. The Secretary
   of the Interior addresses the nation.

   A live connection is established to a field artillery battery in the
   Watchung Mountains. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a
   release of poisonous black smoke, before fading into the sound of
   coughing. The lead plane of a wing of bombers from Langham Field
   broadcasts its approach and remains on the air as their engines are
   burned by the heat ray and the plane dives on the invaders in a
   last-ditch suicide attack. Radio operators go active and fall silent:
   although the bombers manage to destroy one machine, the remaining five
   are spreading black smoke across the Jersey Marshes into Newark.

   Eventually, a news reporter, broadcasting from atop the Broadcasting
   Building, describes the Martian invasion of New York City - "five great
   machines" wading the Hudson "like  wading through a brook", black
   smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the East River "like
   rats", others in Times Square "falling like flies". He reads a final
   bulletin stating that Martian cylinders have fallen all over the
   country, then describes the smoke approaching down the street until he
   suffocates and keels over, leaving only the sounds of the city under
   attack in the background. Finally, a despairing ham radio operator is
   heard calling, "2X2L calling CQ, New York. Isn't there anyone on the
   air? Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone?"

   After a period of silence comes the voice of announcer Dan Seymour:

     You are listening to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the
     Mercury Theatre on the Air, in an original dramatization of The War
     of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. The performance will continue after a
     brief intermission. This is the Columbia Broadcasting System.

   The last third of the program is a monologue and dialogue. Professor
   Pierson, having survived the attack on Grover's Mill, attempts to make
   contact with other humans. In Newark, he encounters an opportunistic
   militiaman who holds fascist ideals in regards to man's relationship
   with the Martians, and intends to use Martian weaponry to take control
   of both species. Declaring that he wants no part of "his world",
   Pierson leaves the stranger with his delusions. His journey takes him
   to the ruins of New York, where he discovers that the Martians have
   died - as with the novel, they fell victim to earthly pathogenic germs,
   to which they had no immunity. Life eventually returns to normal, and
   Pierson finishes writing his recollections of the invasion and its
   aftermath.

   After the conclusion of the play, Welles reassumed his role as host and
   told listeners that the broadcast was a Halloween concoction: the
   equivalent, as he put it, "of dressing up in a sheet, jumping out of a
   bush and saying, 'Boo!'" Popular mythology holds that the
   disclaimer was hastily added to the broadcast at the insistence of CBS
   executives, as they became aware of panic inspired by the program; in
   fact, at the station break, network executive Davidson Taylor had
   attempted to prevent Welles, who had added the speech at the last
   minute, from reading it on air for fear of exposing the network to
   legal liability, but Welles delivered it anyway.:95-96
