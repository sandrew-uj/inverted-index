   Called before the World Council, Space Captain David Raven is told that
   he must stop a clandestine war being waged against Terra by people
   seeking independence for Mars and Venus. The Council's leader, Oswald
   Heraty, tells him that Humanity is on the verge of interstellar flight
   and that there have been hints of intelligent life "out there": Heraty
   wants Humanity to face any potential dangers as a unified society, so
   he doesn't want Mars and Venus gaining independence. After leaving the
   Council, David goes to see Mr. Conrad, the director of the Terran
   Security Bureau. As true telepaths, Conrad and David speak mind to
   mind. Conrad gives David a list of the twelve known types of mutants
   and notes that the clandestine war is being waged by mutants sabotaging
   Terran infrastructure.

   David returns to the home that he shares with his companion, Leina, and
   shortly a team of phony police officers arrives. David switches bodies
   with the hypno and then with hypnotic power convinces the others on his
   team that David has already left. Later David reverses the switch and
   obtains from the shaken hypno the identity of the leader of the
   sabotage effort, a Venusian insectivocal named Arthur Kayder. Visiting
   Kayder, David obtains from Kayder's valet the information he wants on
   the underground base from with the saboteurs launch their attacks. He
   then goes to the spaceport and boards a ship bound for Venus.

   Just before the ship lands David jumps out an airlock and lands gently
   in the forest below, then he walks to Plain City, where he meets up
   with Charles and Mavis, his and Leina's counterparts on Venus. He tells
   Charles and Mavis that he has come to Venus to find the man in charge
   of the clandestine war and get him to stop. When Mavis objects that
   it's none of their business, David tells her about the impending leap
   into interstellar space, which will hasten Humanity's meeting with the
   Denebs. Horrified, Charles tells David that he needs to deal with a
   power-behind-the-throne guy named Thorstein and that he's going to
   help.

   With the purest insouciance, David and Charles enter Thorstein's
   castle, defeating every one of its security systems. They assassinate
   Thorstein's decoy and wait for Thorstein himself to arrive. After
   Thorstein arrives and quickly departs, David and Charles kidnap him
   from his helicopter and take him to Charles and Mavis's house. There
   the two men convince Thorstein to abandon his war against Terra,
   pointing out that he likely won't live long enough to become Emperor of
   Venus, that some unworthy stooge will get to enjoy that role.

   Having completed his mission, David steals a rocketship and returns to
   Terra, letting Conrad clean up the legal mess he has created. He joins
   Leina in catching up on news, beamed telepathically across interstellar
   space, regarding the movements of the Denebs. Several weeks later he
   and Leina are picked up and taken to meet Major Lomax of Terrestrial
   Intelligence.

   They are sealed inside a bunker alone with Lomax, who is in so much
   pain from an accident that he does not care whether he lives or dies.
   In order to walk out of the bunker alive, David and Leina must convince
   hidden observers that they are ordinary, if artful, telepaths and not,
   as has been hinted, zombies controlled by extraterrestrial beings
   (which, in fact, is what they are). Charles and Mavis are being
   subjected to an identical interrogation on Venus. The four zombies play
   their roles perfectly as their replacements appear on Terra and Venus,
   then, after the suspicions have been allayed, Lomax has an attack of
   intense pain. Feigning concern, David and Leina jump up as if to help
   and at the same time subject Lomax to a telepathic attack that makes
   him trigger the devices that kill all six of them.

   Lomax regains consciousness in a realm where all pain is gone. He
   learns of the Denebs, advanced creatures possessed of a collective
   inferiority complex that they hide under delusions of superiority so
   brittle that the mere thought of creatures equal to them sends them
   into a genocidal rage. The secret that must be kept from Humanity, lest
   the Denebs discover it, is that humans are the larval form of creatures
   vastly superior to the Denebs.
