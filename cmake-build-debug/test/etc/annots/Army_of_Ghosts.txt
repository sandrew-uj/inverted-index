   A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette, which Jackie insists is the
   ghost of her deceased father, appears in Jackie's flat, surprising both
   the Tenth Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing.
   Jackie explains that a few months previously, millions of ghosts began
   appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and
   believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.

   Conducting an experiment, the Doctor determines that the ghosts are in
   fact impressions of something forcing its way into this universe. The
   Doctor tracks the signal back and uses the TARDIS to travel there with
   Rose and Jackie, arriving at the Torchwood Institute in Canary Wharf.
   The Doctor and Jackie are taken by soldiers to see Torchwood's director
   Yvonne Hartman, while the TARDIS is impounded with Rose inside. Yvonne
   shows the Doctor the invisible breach which is the source of the ghost
   energy, along with a ship which came through the breach: a "Void ship",
   designed to exist in the space between universes known as the Void.
   Torchwood built One Canada Square around the breach and conducted
   experiments on it, forcing it open in an attempt to harness it as a
   source of energy. Yvonne also reveals to the Doctor that his encounter
   with Queen Victoria made him an enemy of the state and was the catalyst
   for the creation of Torchwood.

   Meanwhile, Rose, masquerading as a Torchwood employee, slips out of the
   TARDIS, and gains access to the sphere chamber, where she finds Mickey,
   also disguised as Torchwood staff. An advance guard of Cybermen subvert
   and manipulate three employees into initiating an unscheduled ghost
   shift to forcibly open the breach, causing millions of ghosts to appear
   across the globe before they materialise into their true form, the
   Cybermen. At the same time the Cybermen arrive, the sphere suddenly
   activates and begins to open. The Cybermen are similarly oblivious to
   the origins of the sphere; they simply followed its course through the
   breach.

   In the sphere chamber, Mickey explains to Rose that after a battle in
   the parallel universe the Cybermen mysteriously disappeared. He
   happened upon their means of escape and returned to his native universe
   with the intention of stopping them. Mickey believes that the Cybermen
   are in control of the sphere and produces a gun to destroy whatever is
   in it. Rose is horrified when the sphere opens and reveals its
   occupants to be four Daleks.
