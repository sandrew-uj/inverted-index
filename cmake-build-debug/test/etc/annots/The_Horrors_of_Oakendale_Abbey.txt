   The novel tells the story of Laura, a foundling refugee from
   revolutionary France, her attempted seduction at the hands of Lord
   Oakendale and her explorations of the haunted Cumberland abbey of the
   title which lead her to stumble upon a den of resurrection men and body
   snatchers. It is unusually graphic in its depiction of death and decay,
   even by the standards of the day, in terms of its descriptions of the
   gruesome. The book is similar in some respects to Eliza Parsons' The
   Castle of Wolfenbach although it does not have the same emotional
   subtlety of that work.
