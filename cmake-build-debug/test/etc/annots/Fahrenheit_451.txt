   Fahrenheit 451 is set in an unspecified city (likely in the American
   Midwest) in the year 2049 (according to Ray Bradbury's Coda), though it
   is written as if set in a distant future.^[note 1]^[16] The earliest
   editions make clear that it takes place no earlier than the year
   1960.^[note 2]^[17]

   The novel is divided into three parts: "The Hearth and the Salamander,"
   "The Sieve and the Sand," and "Burning Bright."
