   In 1953, Esther Greenwood, a young woman from the suburbs of Boston,
   gains a summer internship at a prominent magazine in New York City
   under editor Jay Cee; however, Esther is neither stimulated nor excited
   by the big city, nor by the glamorous culture and lifestyle that girls
   her age are expected to idolize and emulate. She instead finds her
   experience to be frightening and disorienting; she appreciates the
   witty sarcasm and adventurousness of her friend Doreen, but also
   identifies with the piety of Betsy (dubbed "Pollyanna Cowgirl"), a
   "goody-goody" sorority girl who always does the right thing. She has a
   benefactress in Philomena Guinea, a formerly successful fiction writer
   (based on Olive Higgins Prouty).

   Esther describes in detail several seriocomic incidents that occur
   during her internship, kicked off by an unfortunate but amusing
   experience at a banquet for the girls held by the staff of Ladies' Day
   magazine. She reminisces about her friend Buddy, whom she has dated
   more or less seriously, and who considers himself her de facto fiance.
   She also muses about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who are scheduled for
   execution. Shortly before the internship ends, she attends a country
   club party with Doreen and is set up with a man who treats her roughly
   and nearly rapes her, before she breaks his nose and leaves. That
   night, after returning to the hotel, she throws all of her clothes off
   the roof.

   The day after, she returns to her Massachusetts home in borrowed
   clothes from Betsy and still bloodied from the night before. She has
   been hoping for another scholarly opportunity once she is back in
   Massachusetts, a writing course taught by a world-famous author, but on
   her return she is immediately told by her mother that she was not
   accepted for the course and finds her plans derailed. She decides to
   spend the summer potentially writing a novel, although she feels she
   lacks enough life experience to write convincingly. All of her identity
   has been centered upon doing well academically; she is unsure of what
   to make of her life once she leaves school, and none of the choices
   presented to her (motherhood, as exemplified by the prolific
   child-bearer Dodo Conway, or stereotypical female careers such as
   stenography) appeal to her. Esther becomes increasingly depressed, and
   finds herself unable to sleep. Her mother encourages, or perhaps
   forces, her to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Gordon, whom Esther mistrusts
   because he is attractive and seems to be showing off a picture of his
   charming family rather than listening to her. He prescribes
   electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); afterward, she tells her mother that
   she will not go back.

   Esther's mental state worsens. She makes several half-hearted attempts
   at suicide, including swimming far out to sea, before making a serious
   attempt. She leaves a note saying she is taking a long walk, then
   crawls into a hole in the cellar and swallows about 50 sleeping pills
   that had been prescribed for her insomnia. In a very dramatic episode,
   the newspapers presume her kidnapping and death, but she is discovered
   under her house after an indeterminate amount of time. She survives and
   is sent to several different mental hospitals until her college
   benefactress, Philomena Guinea, supports her stay at an elite treatment
   center where she meets Dr. Nolan, a female therapist. Along with
   regular psychotherapy sessions, Esther is given huge amounts of insulin
   to produce a "reaction", and again receives shock treatments, with Dr.
   Nolan ensuring that they are properly administered. While there, she
   describes her depression as a feeling of being trapped under a bell
   jar, struggling for breath. Eventually, Esther describes the ECT as
   beneficial in that it has a sort of antidepressant effect; it lifts the
   metaphorical bell jar in which she has felt trapped and stifled. While
   there, she also becomes reacquainted with Joan Gilling, who also used
   to date Buddy.

   Esther tells Dr. Nolan how she envies the freedom that men have and how
   she, as a woman, worries about getting pregnant. Dr. Nolan refers her
   to a doctor who fits her for a diaphragm. Esther now feels free from
   her fears about the consequences of sex; free from previous pressures
   to get married, potentially to the wrong man. Under Dr. Nolan, Esther
   improves and various life-changing events, such as losing her virginity
   and Joan's suicide, help her to regain her sanity. The novel ends with
   her entering the room for an interview, which will decide whether she
   can leave the hospital and return to school.

   It is suggested near the beginning of the novel that, in later years,
   Esther goes on to have a baby.
