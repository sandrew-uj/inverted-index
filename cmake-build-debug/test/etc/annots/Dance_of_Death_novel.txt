   The book follows FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast and his
   sidekick, Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta. Pendergast was last seen at the
   end of the previous novel, Brimstone, where he was buried alive behind
   a brick wall in Castel Fosco. His estranged brother, Diogenes, rescues
   him and nurses him back to health. However this is not a true act of
   kindness; Diogenes has a dark agenda and needs his brother alive in
   order to carry out his nefarious plans.

   Pendergast's ward Constance Greene requests Vincent D'Agosta's presence
   for a very important meeting. D'Agosta is shown a letter written many
   months previously by Pendergast about his brother Diogenes. In the
   letter, Pendergast writes that he does not know of Diogenes's
   whereabouts, but does in fact know one thing--a date, January 28.
   D'Agosta presumes that this will be the date of Diogenes's greatest
   crime. Having been hated by and hating his family, Diogenes obviously
   cannot be trusted.
