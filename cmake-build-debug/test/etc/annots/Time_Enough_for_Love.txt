   The book covers several periods from the life of Lazarus Long (born
   Woodrow Wilson Smith), an early beneficiary of a breeding experiment
   designed to increase mankind's natural lifespan, known as the Howard
   Families, after the program's initiator. The result of more a mutation
   than the breeding experiment, he is the oldest living human, at more
   than two thousand years old.

   The first half of the book takes the form of several novellas connected
   by Lazarus's retrospective narrative. In the framing story, Lazarus has
   decided that life is no longer worth living, but, in what is described
   as a reverse Arabian Nights scenario, agrees not to end his life for as
   long as his companion, chief executive of the Howard Families and
   descendant Ira Weatheral, will listen to his stories.
