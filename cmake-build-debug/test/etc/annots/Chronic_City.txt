   Lethem began work on Chronic City in early 2007, and has said that
   the novel is "set on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, it's strongly
   influenced by Saul Bellow, Philip K. Dick, Charles Finney and
   Hitchcock's Vertigo, and it concerns a circle of friends including a
   faded child-star actor, a cultural critic, a hack ghost-writer of
   autobiographies, and a city official."
