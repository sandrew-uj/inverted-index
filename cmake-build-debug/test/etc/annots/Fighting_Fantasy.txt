   Most early Fighting Fantasy titles were set in locations later revealed
   to be on the same continent called Allansia. Later a whole world named
   Titan was developed, with subsequent gamebooks set on three main
   continents--Allansia, Khul and the Old World. Other titles are set
   in unrelated fantasy, horror, modern day, and sci-fi environments.
