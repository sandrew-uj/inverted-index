   The Centauri Device is the third novel by English author M. John
   Harrison. The novel, originally conceived as an "anti-space opera"
   would ultimately go on to make a major contribution to revitalising the
   subgenre and influencing the works of later authors such as Iain M.
   Banks and Alastair Reynolds.
