   In autumn 1943, the unnamed narrator befriends Holly Golightly. The two
   are tenants in a brownstone apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side.
   Holly (age 18-19) is a country girl turned New York cafe society girl.
   As such, she has no job and lives by socializing with wealthy men, who
   take her to clubs and restaurants, and give her money and expensive
   presents; she hopes to marry one of them. According to Capote,
   Golightly is not a prostitute, but an "American geisha".

   Holly likes to shock people with carefully selected tidbits from her
   personal life or her outspoken viewpoints on various topics. Over the
   course of a year, she slowly reveals herself to the narrator, who finds
   himself quite fascinated by her curious lifestyle.
