   Dr. Guy Carson is a young scientist and cowboy-at-heart, raised on a
   southwestern ranch and bored with city life. That is, until the
   prestigious genetic engineering corporation GeneDyne offers Carson a
   six-month position as a lab researcher at its Mount Dragon Remote
   Desert Testing Facility in Jornada del Muerto desert in New Mexico.
   Carson accepts and soon finds that the Mount Dragon laboratory is
   testing far more promising and dangerous things than Carson ever
   expected. Scientists at the facility spend months isolated from the
   outside world, essentially locked in the guarded facility within a
   Level 5 containment lab, as they research a vaccine for the influenza
   virus. With the help of his feisty lab assistant, Susanna Cabeza de
   Vaca, Carson begins to unlock the mysteries of the spontaneously
   mutating influenza virus, dubbed "X-FLU".

   Over time, Carson and DeVaca discover that their predecessor Dr.
   Franklin Burt, was literally driven mad by his time at Mount Dragon and
   was institutionalized. Burt's death is not the only one caused by the
   facility; an emergency quarantine prompted by the contamination of the
   Level 5 lab by a chimp infected with the deadly X-FLU results in the
   death of researcher Rosalind Brandon-Smith. Soon, more human harm
   follows as Carson's friend and messmate Dr. Andrew Vanderwagon
   spontaneously punctures his own eye with a fork and attempts to commit
   suicide and kill others. Through researching Burt's descent to madness,
   Carson and DeVaca realize that what occurred with Vanderwagon closely
   resembled the behavior of Burt toward the end. In fact, everyone at the
   facility except for Carson and DeVaca begin to display abnormal and
   erratic behavior that Carson at first presumes is the result of tight
   quarters or contamination by X-FLU.

   However, Carson has an epiphany after conducting further tests on
   influenza and discovers that what caused the virus to mutate is Burt's
   filtering system -- a system that was used to filter the artificial
   blood product PurBlood that GeneDyne is releasing in hospitals across
   the nation in mere days. Burt's journal confirms that PurBlood is in
   fact contaminated; Burt's filtering system caused the contamination by
   mutating the cells in the artificial blood.

   Carson and DeVaca are the only workers at the Mount Dragon facility who
   did not undergo a PurBlood transfusion for beta testing, and thus are
   the only ones not driven to insanity by the contamination. They set off
   an explosion to destroy the facility and flee from its homicidal and
   suicidal inhabitants. Attempting to alert officials before PurBlood can
   be introduced across the nation, resulting in an epidemic, Carson and
   DeVaca set off on horseback across the arid New Mexico desert, hundreds
   of miles from the nearest civilization. They are chased by the security
   director, an eccentric Englishman named Nye whose PurBlood-induced
   madness has led him to believe that there is a treasure buried in the
   desert and that Carson and DeVaca are trying to steal it from him.
   After days of thirst and starvation, Carson and DeVaca find water--and
   the remains of the worthless "treasure" of Spanish explorer
   Mondragon--before engaging in a fight-to-the-death battle with Nye.
   Carson and DeVaca are injured, but survive, and make it to a nearby
   cattle ranch in time to spread the word about the dangers of PurBlood.

   Aside from the action-ridden plot of Carson and DeVaca, the novel
   highlights political and scientific battle between the CEO of GeneDyne,
   Brent Scopes, and his former best friend, Charles Levine, over the
   ethics of genetic modification. Scopes argues that genetic
   modification, such as that involved in the creation of PurBlood, will
   one day lead to a healthier human race. Levine counters that the extent
   of the dangers of genetically modified products is unknown, and that
   humans should proceed with caution in genetically altering or
   engineering products that could change the biological make-up of
   humanity. In the end, Scopes and Levine are exposed to the mutated
   influenza virus X-FLU and resolve their differences before dying.
