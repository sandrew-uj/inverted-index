   A U.S. passenger airliner in 1989 is about to be struck from above by
   another airliner on a landing approach. The pilot handles the plane as
   well as he can while the first officer goes to check on the passenger
   cabin. He returns to the cockpit yelling, "They're dead! All of them!
   They're burned up!"

   Bill Smith is a National Transportation Safety Board investigator hired
   to investigate the collision and subsequent crashes. He and his team
   are confused by the first officer's words on the cockpit voice
   recorder, as there is no evidence of a fire before the crash.
   Meanwhile, a theoretical physicist, Dr. Arnold Mayer, has a
   professional curiosity about the crash, which borders on science
   fiction. In a lecture, he talks about the possibility of visits from
   time travelers.

   In the future, pollution has rendered humans unable to reproduce, so
   teams are sent into the past to abduct people who are about to die; the
   plane crashes were part of this plan. The abductees are kept in stasis
   until they can be sent into the far future to repopulate the Earth.
   Many people are in poor health but those sent into the past--mostly
   women--are relatively healthy and are given the best food and care so
   that they can pass for 20th-century humans. Present-day air is too
   clean for the time travelers to process; they smoke cigarettes to mimic
   the atmosphere they are used to. They are warned about not smoking
   enough when they return to the future.

   Every incursion into the past causes an accompanying "timequake", with
   a magnitude proportional to the incursion's effects. Time travelers try
   to minimize their effects by replacing those they abduct with
   organically grown copies. This is the source of the co-pilot's comment
   about the passengers being burned; the copies had been pre-burned in
   preparation for the crash.

   In 1963, a time traveler on a plane is shot before it crashes, losing a
   stun weapon as a result. This weapon winds up in the possession of Dr.
   Mayer, setting him on the path to working out what is happening.
   Twenty-five years later Smith finds a similar artifact among the
   wreckage of the crash portrayed at the beginning of the film.

   Worried that the discoveries made by Smith and Mayer might change
   history, Louise Baltimore travels back to 1989 to discourage Bill Smith
   from pursuing his investigation. She gains Bill's trust and seduces him
   into a one-night stand, which she hopes will distract him. Over time,
   Bill becomes suspicious and visits Dr. Mayer. Louise materializes from
   the future and reveals her mission to them, in the hope that they will
   voluntarily keep the secret. During the conversation, Mayer
   accidentally kills himself reassembling the stun weapon.

   Mayer was instrumental in the development of the Gate technology that
   made time travel possible; his death results in an unsolvable
   paradox--a force infinity timequake--which will destroy the entire
   civilization of the future timeline. The only course of action is to
   send all of the people who have been collected into the distant future
   before the Gate is permanently destroyed.

   Bill and Louise step through the Gate and disappear. As an explosion
   destroys the Gate and the blast wave engulfs him, Sherman the Robot,
   who advised Louise frequently, quotes Winston Churchill: "This is not
   the end. This is not the beginning of the end. It is the end of the
   beginning."
