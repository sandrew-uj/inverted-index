   The story concerns the nautical exploits of the titular captain and his
   rambunctious crew aboard their ship The Black Tiger. After some
   episodic adventures they capture a small humanoid, referred to only as
   the Yellow Creature, with whom Slaughterboard develops a strange
   platonic infatuation. His loyal crew gradually fall prey to
   misadventure and the book ends with the Captain and the Yellow Creature
   forsaking piracy for fishing on the creature's pink island.^[3] The
   book is notable for Peake's poetic style and his fine illustrations of
   the many fantastical beasts on the island.^[4]
