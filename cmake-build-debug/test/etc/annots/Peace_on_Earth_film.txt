   Two young squirrels ask their grandfather (voiced by Mel Blanc) on
   Christmas Eve who the "men" are in the lyric "Peace on Earth, good will
   to men." The grandfather squirrel then tells them a history of the
   human race, focusing on the never-ending wars men waged. Ultimately the
   wars do end, with the deaths of the last men on Earth, two soldiers
   shooting each other, one shoots the other soldier and the injured
   soldier kills the last, but slowly dies as he sinks into a watery
   foxhole while his hand grasps into the water. Afterwards, the surviving
   animals discover a copy of an implied Bible in the ruins of a church.
   Inspired by the book's teachings, they decide to rebuild a society
   dedicated to peace and non-violence (using the helmets of the soldiers
   to construct houses). The short features a version of "Hark! The Herald
   Angels Sing" with rewritten lyrics, and a trio of carolers sing this
   song outside of the squirrels' house.
