   A murder takes place in a rural British hospital. Inspector Cockrill is
   tasked to determine whodunit when the head nurse is killed after
   revealing that the death of a patient under anaesthesia was no
   accident. Cockrill states at one point, "My presence lay over the
   hospital like a pall - I found it all tremendously enjoyable." After
   another murder attempt leaves a nurse dangerously ill he re-stages the
   operation in order to unmask the murderer.
