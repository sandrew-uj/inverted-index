   Within the Marvel Multiverse is an alternate Earth designated
   Earth-2149, which contains alternate zombie versions of Marvel
   superheroes. The story begins as an unknown superhero from another
   dimension, brought by the "Hunger", crash lands before infecting the
   Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four and almost all other superheroes. The
   infection spreads by contact with the blood of the victim, usually
   through a bite by an infected individual. The zombie super heroes
   largely retain their intellect, personality and their super powers,
   although they are consistently driven by the "Hunger" for human flesh.
   (Captain America notes that he is still functioning with -literally-
   half a brain, having been partially decapitated by Magneto with his own
   shield.) As the story begins, the Marvel Zombies have already
   devoured all non-transhuman human life on Earth and are now without
   food (as prefigured in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, a later tie-in).

   The series begins where the Crossover story-arc ended, with Magneto
   destroying the cross-dimensional transporter after the Ultimate
   Fantastic Four and survivors escaped back to the Ultimate universe.
   After a battle with the zombies, Magneto learns that the Acolytes and
   Forge are still alive on Asteroid M. However, before he can reach them,
   he is attacked once again, killed and eaten by the zombies, though he
   manages to behead the zombified Hawkeye. The Silver Surfer arrives on
   Earth and informs the zombies that his master Galactus is en route to
   devour the planet. The zombies attack the Silver Surfer, who is
   overpowered and devoured by several of the former superheroes: Colonel
   America, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, the Hulk, and
   Wolverine. After acquiring a portion of the Power Cosmic, they
   slaughter most of the remaining zombies, intent on satiating their
   hunger despite the latters' unpalatability.

   The Acolytes return to Earth to find Magneto, but instead discover a
   still-living Black Panther. The Panther has escaped from the lab of the
   zombie Giant-Man, who has been keeping him alive as a food source, as a
   result of which the Panther is now missing an arm and a foot. Zombie
   Wasp gets into an argument with her husband when she discovers he was
   hoarding the Black Panther. He promptly decapitates Zombie Wasp by
   biting off her head, which remains sentient. After observing the Wasp's
   head begging for flesh, Black Panther reasons that the hunger is more
   psychological than physical.

   Meanwhile, the zombies have decided that the flesh of other zombies
   just isn't satisfying. Galactus then arrives on Earth and is attacked
   by the zombies, but he repels them easily. Giant-Man, Iron Man and
   Bruce Banner create a device that amplifies the powers they gained from
   the Silver Surfer, and together with Colonel America, Luke Cage,
   Spider-Man and Wolverine they are able to injure Galactus. The
   cosmic-powered zombies fight off zombified versions of several
   supervillains, although Colonel America is killed by the Red Skull, and
   then proceed to devour Galactus. Giant-Man, the Hulk, Iron Man, Luke
   Cage, Spider-Man and Wolverine are then infused with Galactus' power
   cosmic' the group thus becomes collective Galacti.

   Five years later, Black Panther, the Acolytes, and the Wasp, restored
   with a cybernetic body, return to Earth to find the planet depopulated.
   Unknown to them (although it is one hypothesis), the Zombie Galacti
   have taken their hunger to the stars.

   In the final scenes, an intelligent alien race on a distant planet is
   fearful of the coming of Galactus, as they can see the signs of his
   imminent arrival in the night sky. To their horror, the Zombie Galacti
   land on their world instead and immediately begin to consume the
   populace.
