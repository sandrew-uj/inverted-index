   The plot revolves around fourteen colonists of the planet Delmak-O.
   They are: Betty Jo Berm, a linguist; elderly Bert Kostler, settlement
   custodian; Maggie Walsh, a theologian; Ignatz Thugg, who oversees
   thermoplastics; Milton Babble, a physician; Wade Frazer, a
   psychologist; Tony Dunkelwelt, a geologist; Glen Belsnor, who
   specialises in telecommunications; Susie Smart, a typist; Roberta
   Rockingham, a sociologist; Ben Tallchief, a naturalist; Seth and Mary
   Morley, a marine biologist couple; and Ned Russell, an economist.

   The colonists travel in one-way rockets consecutively to Delmak-O to
   take part in an unknown colonization project. After all landed, their
   assignment should be communicated via satellite. However, the
   communication system fails, leaving the colonists without contact to
   the outside world. Thus, the colonists try to identify their task and
   explore Delmak-O.

   Delmak-O seems to be inhabited by both real and artificial beings and
   enormous cube-shaped, gelatinous objects ("tenches") that duplicate
   items presented to them and give out advice, in anagrams reminiscent of
   the I Ching. In addition, various members of the group report sightings
   of a large "Building." As various calamities continue to befall each
   character, part of the group ventures out to find the mysterious
   structure. Each member of the group perceives the Building's entrance
   motto, and thus its purpose, differently.

   One by one, the characters Tallchief, Smart, Berm, Dunkelwelt, Kostler
   and Walsh either kill themselves or are killed under mysterious
   circumstances. During a fight between the remaining colonists Seth
   Morley is shot through the shoulder causing an artery to be severed.
   While recovering from an attempt to repair the artery, Morley is
   abducted by armed men who kill Belsnor. They put Morley aboard a small
   flying craft but Morley overpowers them and takes control of the craft.
   With it he discovers that Delmak-O seems in fact to be Earth, and he
   returns to the group to report this.

   The group then comes to the conclusion that they are all criminally
   insane and part of a psychiatric experiment in rehabilitation. Once
   they admit to having killed the other members they conclude that the
   experiment must have been a failure. It is at this point that they
   notice that each of them is tattooed with the phrase, "Persus 9." They
   decide to ask a tench what this means but doing so causes the tench to
   explode and the world around them to crumble to pieces.

   All of them, including the colonists thought to be dead, awake to find
   that they are actually the crew of the spaceship Persus 9, stranded in
   orbit around a dead star with no way of calling for help. Their
   experiences had been a kind of virtual reality, a computer-generated
   religion that synthesized their beliefs. Their dormancy should save
   energy of the ship's life support systems for the unlikely case someone
   would detect the stranded ship and rescue them. It becomes clear that
   they already completed several cycles of virtual reality dormancy, due
   to the gradual disintegration each more nightmarish than the previous
   one. Seth Morley is depressed by this and wonders whether it would be
   better to let all the air out from the ship and thus kill them all
   rather than live out the rest of their lives engaging in virtual
   realities. However, a deity known as the Intercessor, supposedly
   existing only in the virtual reality program and not a part of the
   "real" world, appears before Morley and stops him, stating that death
   is for each individual to decide for themselves. It offers Morley a
   choice of possible forms to be reborn as, and he decides on "a cactus
   on some warm world... to be asleep but still aware of the sun and of
   myself". The Intercessor guides him into the stars, stating he will
   "live and sleep for a thousand years".

   The others, unconcerned with his disappearance, embark on another
   hallucination which resembles the previous one, only without Seth
   Morley.
