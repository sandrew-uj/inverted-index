   Physicist Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at the Black Mesa
   Research Facility. As part of an experiment, he pushes an unusual
   material into a machine for analysis. The spectrometer explodes,
   creating a "resonance cascade" that severely damages the facility and
   opens a portal to another dimension, Xen. Surviving scientists urge
   Gordon to head to the surface, where he defends himself against hostile
   Xen creatures and HECU (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit) Marines sent
   to cover up the incident.

   Heading to the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda
   Complex may have found a way to close the portal. Gordon travels to the
   other end of the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a
   rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and
   uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket.
   After he is captured by marines and left for dead in a garbage
   compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the
   facility. There, he discovers Xen specimens collected before the
   incident. Overwhelmed by the alien forces, the HECU Marines pull out of
   Black Mesa and begin airstrikes. Scaling cliffs, navigating destroyed
   buildings, and traversing through underground water channels, Gordon
   arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists learn the portal is
   being forced open on the other side by an immensely powerful entity.
   They have developed teleportation technology that allows Gordon to
   travel to Xen, where he is tasked to stop the entity.

   In Xen, Gordon encounters the remains of researchers who ventured there
   before him and defeats the Gonarch, a huge egg-laying headcrab. At a
   factory creating alien soldiers, he enters a portal that sends him to a
   vast cave. There, Gordon confronts the Nihilanth, the entity
   maintaining the rift, and destroys it. Gordon is summoned by the
   mysterious G-Man, who has been watching his progress in Black Mesa and
   praises him. The G-Man explains his "employers" wish to employ Gordon.
   If Gordon refuses, he is teleported to an area full of alien soldiers
   to be killed immediately. If Gordon accepts, the G-Man congratulates
   him and places him into stasis to await his next task.
