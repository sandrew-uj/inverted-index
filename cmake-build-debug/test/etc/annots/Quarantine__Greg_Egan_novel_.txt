   The novel is set in the near future (2034-2080), after the solar system
   has been surrounded by an impenetrable shield known as the Bubble,
   presumably by an extraterrestrial civilization for unknown reasons. The
   Bubble permits no light to enter the solar system, and as a consequence
   the stars can no longer be seen, causing widespread societal panic,
   'claustrophobia', and terrorist action. Neural mods are common place,
   designed pathways in the brain that are created with engineered,
   programmable microorganisms to produce a variety of effects, such as
   implanting skillsets, emotions, altered states of awareness or,
   illegally, forcing and controlling thoughts.

   The narrator, Nick, contains a suite of tactical mods that allow him to
   suppress emotions and enhance tactical and analytical thought. Nick is
   a private eye forced to quit the police force after the death of his
   wife, the trauma of which caused him to activate his emotional
   suppression mod, which further prompted him to purchase a mod that
   simulates the feeling of love and wellbeing of his wife still being
   alive, logically solving the problem of grief.

   Nick accepts a case to investigate Laura, a woman who has vanished from
   a psychiatric institute, after several instances of her escaping. The
   institute staff insist that short of walking through a wall, it should
   not have been possible to escape the previous times, though it comes to
   light that she was kidnapped in this instance.

   Investigation in New Hong Kong leads Nick to the group responsible, the
   Ensemble, but causes him to be captured. Nick is implanted by an
   illegal 'Loyalty Mod', which causes him to earnestly and truly believe
   in the goals of the Ensemble. Nick is used as a security guard for the
   project the ensemble is working on, a new neural mod perfected by
   studying Laura. This mod, called the Eigenstate Mod or 'Eigenmod',
   allows the brain to consciously control the physical process that is
   responsible for wave function collapse. This feature of neurology is
   present in several animal species, and one of the researchers
   responsible for the mod, Po-kwai, suspects that the Bubble may exist
   because humanity may have been aggressively collapsing the wave
   functions of alien civilizations that did not have the ability to do
   so, causing them harm. When using the mod, the user becomes 'Smeared',
   existing within a superposition of states constantly, therefore every
   possible set of actions they take being equally 'real'. When one
   version of the user succeeds in whatever they want to do, they
   deactivate the mod, collapsing the eigenstates into that one subjective
   reality. This allows the mod to seemingly control probability to do
   anything, though raises questions of morality and philosophy to the
   narrator, who considers deactivating the mod equivalent to murdering
   the other equally real versions of the user.

   Nick eventually meets a group of Ensemble members who like him are
   under the control of the Loyalty mod. They explain to him that the
   loyalty mod only specifies their loyalty to Ensemble, but fails to
   specify what the ensemble actually is. Therefore, via logical argument,
   the group (calling itself the Canon) decides that as by definition the
   most loyal members of the ensemble, what the ensemble is is up to their
   personal interpretations.

   The Canon has Nick steal and apply the eigenstate mod to himself, which
   he uses for various purposes before eventually meeting with a strangely
   coherent Laura after bypassing otherwise impregnable security with the
   mod. Laura explains that she is naturally capable of smearing, and that
   she is one of the aliens who created the Bubble. The true alien
   consists of an emergent being composed of all the eigenstates of Laura
   at once, that dies when she stops smearing, but captures a holographic
   representation of itself within her mind that rebuilds the alien mind
   when she begins smearing again. Laura explains that life on earth
   developed the ability to collapse wave functions by chance, which
   eventually spread via pure natural selection. As smeared intelligence
   cannot survive in a single, unique state of the universe, they erected
   the bubble, preventing humanity from seeing and thus deciding the state
   of anything outside it, while simultaneously protecting humanity from
   the starkly alien nature of outside reality. Laura finishes by
   explaining her role as an observer, there to offer humanity a way to
   join the rest of the universe, if they choose to. She also warns Nick
   of his Smeared self, which she describes as a child and unsure of its
   abilities, but which is becoming increasingly aware that its goals do
   not align with that of Nick's, who she describes as a single cell to a
   much larger, complex and much more alien Smeared Nick.

   A member of the canon uses the stolen eigenstate mod to cheat the
   production of engineered microbes that can install the mod into people,
   while also acting and spreading like a disease would, so that he may
   spread the ability to smear to humanity and join the aliens in smeared
   reality. Nick attempts to stop the release of the plague but is
   unsuccessful. Not long after, New Hong Kong begins to be filled with
   strange and impossible events, people changing faces, turning to glass
   or vanishing while holograms become real and the sky begins to rain
   blood. Nick finds Po-kwai, and both affirm that while they are not
   precisely scared of what is coming, they are not ready for such an
   existence. Po-kwai postulates that this outcome was inevitable and not
   the fault of smeared Nick--that instead the smeared total of all of
   humanity tunneled into possibility. Humans around them begin to blur as
   the smeared minds begin to increase in complexity. Both watch as stars
   begin to appear in the sky until it is filled with blinding white
   light.

   In the Epilogue, Nick resides in a refugee camp outside of New Hong
   Kong, the disease apparently only spreading within the city before
   stopping, but not before causing massive damage and leaving millions
   dead, often in gruesome and fantastical ways. The only difference for
   Nick being that his Loyalty mod and the mod simulating love for his
   wife have been permanently removed, with Nick finding the idea of
   embracing artificial satisfaction disgusting despite his newfound
   grief. It is left unclear if the Bubble still exists. Nick and Po-kwai
   part ways, confused as to why smeared humanity, after going to the
   trouble of coming to exist, would interact with reality outside the
   bubble and recoil. Nick initially believes that smeared humanity found
   the world outside the bubble distasteful, causing them to suicide into
   a single unique eigenstate again. He begins to suspect though that
   humanity has in fact smeared and joined the universe, and that he is
   merely one possibility out of infinite miracles and infinite suffering,
   his perceived reality being but one tiny aspect of his emergent,
   smeared self. Nick tries to come to terms with this, lying awake at
   night contemplating it till he finally falls asleep.
