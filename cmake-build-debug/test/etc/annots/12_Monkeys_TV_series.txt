   In the year 2043, scavenger James Cole (Aaron Stanford) has been
   recruited by a team of "Project Splinter" scientists led by physicist
   Katarina Jones (Barbara Sukowa), to travel back in time to the year
   2015, and stop the release of a deadly virus by the enigmatic
   organization known as the "Army of the 12 Monkeys". In Cole's original
   timeline, the virus caused a plague (Kalavirus) that resulted in the
   death of seven billion humans in the year 2017, and its on-going
   mutations will mean the eventual end of the human race. In the 2015
   timeline, Cole will meet and enlist the help of brilliant virologist
   Dr. Cassandra "Cassie" Railly (Amanda Schull); the two are brought
   together because a recording mentioning Cole, that Cassie made after
   the viral outbreak, is uncovered by Katarina Jones in the future
   timeline, prompting her to select Cole for the mission. Cole will also
   encounter a seemingly unstable math genius named Jennifer Goines (Emily
   Hampshire), whose father Cole has been tasked to kill, Cassie's
   ex-boyfriend Aaron Marker (Noah Bean), and the dangerous high-ranking
   members of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, "Pallid Man" (Tom Noonan) and
   Olivia (Alisen Down). In the future timeline, Cole will also have to
   deal with his best friend Jose Ramse (Kirk Acevedo), and a man named
   Theodore Deacon (Todd Stashwick), who leads a brutal pack of scavengers
   from which Cole and Ramse fled. Meanwhile, Cole and Cassie will try to
   unveil the identity and whereabouts of the mysterious leader of the
   Army of the 12 Monkeys, who is only known as "the Witness" and who is
   always one step ahead of them.
