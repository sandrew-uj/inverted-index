   The morning after a severe thunderstorm, an unnaturally thick mist
   gradually envelopes the small town of Bridgton, Maine. Artist David
   Drayton, along with his son Billy and neighbor Brent Norton (whose car
   had been smashed by a fallen tree), go to the local supermarket for
   groceries. Upon arrival, their suspicions are aroused by the sound of a
   siren. The mist completely covers the supermarket and conceals strange
   and hostile creatures. The situation is aggravated by an earthquake,
   which damages communications and leaves the store without electricity.
   When a young bagger, Norm, goes outside to fix a clogged vent in the
   store's generator, he is dragged into the mist by tentacles.

   David and assistant manager Ollie Weeks witness Norm's death and try to
   convince the remaining survivors of what has happened, imploring that
   no one leave the store. Norton and a small group of people accuse David
   of lying and go outside for help, only to be killed by a huge creature.
   Ollie is given a revolver by the young Amanda Dumfries. Later,
   pterosaur-like creatures fly into the store and are killed by
   improvised means. Two soldiers from a nearby military base reveal that
   the mist may be associated with "Project Arrowhead" - in which they
   were involved - before committing suicide. David leads a group of
   people to obtain medical supplies from an adjacent pharmacy, where they
   encounter huge spiders. In the wake of mass hysteria among the
   survivors, religious fanatic Mrs. Carmody convinces them that the
   current events fulfill a biblical prophecy of the end time, and
   believes that human sacrifice is required to save themselves from God's
   wrath.

   Later, David, Billy, Ollie, Amanda and a few other survivors attempt to
   break out of the store, but are thwarted by Mrs. Carmody, who convinces
   the crowd to offer Billy and Amanda as sacrifices. Ollie shoots
   Mrs. Carmody and dissolves her congregation. En route to David's car,
   Ollie and one other survivor are killed, while another flees back to
   the store. The group attempts to reach David's house, but the roads to
   it are either blocked or damaged. On the radio, through the
   interference, David hears of Hartford, and he drives on in the hope of
   an escape from the mist.
