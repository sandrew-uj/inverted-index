   A few survivors have dedicated themselves to preserving and protecting
   what is left of mankind; among these is former Army Captain John Thomas
   Garth (Grant Show). Approached by Lapierre (Steve Bacic), a former
   comrade now employed by eco-profiteer Anton Reich (Art Hindle), Garth
   is made an offer he cannot refuse. In exchange for his father's and
   other's survival, Reich agrees to lead a small team of mercenaries into
   the impenetrable Vincent estate to "liberate" the priceless works of
   art that had been stored there. Accompanied by reconnaissance
   specialist Fernandez (Naomi Gaskin), sniper King (Matthew G. Taylor),
   and tech genius Ebershaw (Wayne Ward), Garth must find a way to
   circumvent Encrypt, the deadly computerized security system surrounding
   the estate. Other obstacles include the Rook, a killer robot, and Diana
   (Vivian Wu), the holographic security chief of the estate. With the
   help of Lapierre, Garth destroys the Rook and discovers that it
   actually protects a device that can restore the ozone layer. With the
   help of Diana, Garth triggers it, but presumably dies soon afterwards.
