   The Ship Who Sang (1969) is a science fiction novel by American writer
   Anne McCaffrey, a fix-up of five stories published 1961 to 1969.^[1] By
   an alternate reckoning, "The Ship Who Sang" is the earliest of the
   stories, a novelette, which became the first chapter of the book.^[2]
   Finally, the entire "Brain & Brawn Ship series" (or Brainship or Ship
   series), written by McCaffrey and others, is sometimes called the "Ship
   Who Sang series" by bibliographers, merchants, or fans.^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6]

   The protagonist of the 1969 novel and all the early stories is a
   cyborg, Helva, a human being and a spaceship, or "brainship". The five
   older stories are revised under their original titles as the first five
   chapters of the book and the sixth chapter is entirely new.^[1]

   McCaffrey dedicated the book "to the memory of the Colonel, my father,
   George Herbert McCaffrey, citizen soldier patriot for whom the first
   ship sang."^[7] In 1994 she named it as the book she is most proud
   of.^[8] Subsequently she named the first story her best story and her
   personal favorite work.^[9]^[10]^[11]

   During the 1990s McCaffrey made The Ship Who Sang the first book of a
   series by writing four novels in collaboration with four co-authors,
   two of whom each later completed another novel in the series alone. By
   1997 there were seven novels, one old and six more recent.^[3] They
   share a fictional premise but feature different cyborg characters.
