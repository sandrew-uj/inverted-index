   Kingdoms of Elfin is a short story collection by Sylvia Townsend
   Warner, published by the Viking Press in 1977, a year before her death.
   Many of the stories appeared originally in The New Yorker during the
   1970s. The stories are an interconnected series of satirical fantasy
   stories detailing the manners of the fairy courts of Europe.^[1] The
   collection was Warner's last published work.

   The stories range across various traditional lands of Europe and
   beyond, including Broceliande in Brittany, Elfhame in Scotland, Mynydd
   Preseli in Wales, the Forest of Arden and Bury St Edmunds in England,
   and as far away as the Peris of Persia.
