   Two friends are midway on a canoe trip down the River Danube.
   Throughout the story, Blackwood personifies the surrounding environment
   --river, sun, wind-- with powerful and ultimately threatening
   characteristics. Most ominous are the masses of dense, desultory,
   menacing willows, which "moved of their own will as though alive, and
   they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen sense of the
   horrible."

   Shortly after landing their canoe for the evening on a sandy island
   near Bratislava in the Dunajske luhy Protected Landscape Area of
   Austria-Hungary, the narrator reflects on the river's potency,
   human qualities, and his own will:

     Sleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as it became
     conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being,
     through all the countries we had passed, holding our little craft on
     its mighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always
     friendly and well-meaning, till at length we had come inevitably to
     regard it as a Great Personage.

   Blackwood also specifically characterizes the silvery, windblown
   willows as sinister:

     And, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves
     subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by
     reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to
     represent to the imagination a new and mighty power, a power,
     moreover, not altogether friendly to us.

At one point, the two men see a traveler in his "flat-bottomed boat". However, t
he man appears to be warning them and ultimately crosses himself before hurtling
 forward on the river, out of sight. During the night, mysterious forces emerge
from within the forest, including dark shapes which seem to trace the narrator's
 consciousness, tapping sounds outside their tent, shifting gong-like noises, bi
zarre shadows, and the appearance that the willows have changed location. In the
 morning, the two realize that one of their paddles is missing, a slit in the ca
noe needs repair, and some of their food has disappeared. A hint of distrust ari
ses between them. The howling wind dies down on the second day, and a humming ca
lm ensues. During the second night, the second man, the Swede, attempts to hurl
himself into the river as a "sacrifice". However, he is saved by the narrator. T
he next morning, the Swede claims that the mysterious forces have found another
sacrifice which may save them. They discover the corpse of a peasant lodged in r
oots near the shore. When they touch the body, a flurry of living presence seems
 to rise from it and disappear into the sky. Later, they see the body is pockmar
ked with funnel shapes similar to the ones viewed across the island's coastline
during their experience. These are "Their awful mark!" the Swede says. The body
is swept away, resembling an "otter" they thought they had seen the previous day
, and the story ends.

   The precise nature of the mysterious entities in "The Willows" is
   unclear, and they appear at times malevolent or treacherous, while at
   times simply mystical and almost divine: "a new order of experience,
   and in the true sense of the word unearthly," and a world "where great
   things go on unceasingly...vast purposes...that deal directly with the
   soul, and not indirectly with mere expressions of the soul." These
   forces are often contrasted with the natural beauty of the area, itself
   a vigorous dynamic. Overall, the story suggests that the landscape is
   actually an intersection, a point of contact with a "fourth dimension"
   -- "on the frontier of another world, an alien world, a world tenanted
   by willows only and the souls of willows."
