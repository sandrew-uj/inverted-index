   A scientific expedition to the planet Saturn in 2025, aboard the ship
   Ringmaster, discovers a strange satellite in orbit around the planet.
   Commanding the ship is Cirocco Jones, a tall NASA career woman, aided
   by astronomer Gaby Plauget, the clone twin physicists April and August
   Polo, pilot Eugene Springfield, physician Calvin Greene and engineer
   Bill (whose last name is never given).

   As they reach the satellite they realize it is a huge hollow torus, a
   Stanford torus habitat. Before they can report this the ship is
   entangled in cables from the object. The crew is rendered unconscious
   and later wake up inside the habitat. Initially separated, Cirroco and
   Gaby find each other and travel together through the world inside the
   torus to find the rest of the crew.

   As the story progresses, they find Calvin living as a companion inside
   a Blimp, an intelligent gasbag a kilometer long, one of many that swim
   forever in the air inside the habitat. Calvin can speak to the blimp
   and understand its responses, which consist of whistles. His blimp's
   name is Whistlestop, in human terms. Calvin helps Gaby and Cirocco find
   the other crew members (except April). He ultimately decides to leave
   his human companions to live with the blimp permanently.

   The remaining companions encounter the Titanides, strange centaur-like
   beings who speak a language based on music. Cirocco finds she has the
   ability to speak their language. The Titanides are in a perpetual state
   of war with the Angels, birdlike humanoid creatures. They fight because
   of an impulse that occurs when they are near each other, but do not
   know why they have the impulse.

   The humans learn from the Titanides that there is a controlling
   intelligence, called Gaea, and it lives 600 km above them, in the hub
   of the torus. Cirocco, Gaby, and Gene decide to climb up to this place
   using the support cables that maintain the structure against
   centrifugal force. During the journey, Gene's behavior becomes
   increasingly erratic. He rapes Gaby and then rapes Cirocco. He thinks
   he killed Gaby while he gives chase to Cirocco only Gaby is not dead
   and eventually cuts his ear off with a hatchet. After he passes out
   Gaby destroys his face. They get rid of him and keep going. Months of
   climbing brings them high in one of the spokes of the great wheel.
   There they find April, who has been transformed into an angel. She,
   like the other Angels, is solitary by nature, and can hardly bear to be
   near them.

   Finally reaching the hub, they discover Gaea, who presents herself as a
   frumpy middle aged woman. She explains that the great wheel is very
   old, and some of the regional intelligences around the rim have
   rebelled against the center. It was, in fact, one of these regional
   intelligences that had captured the Ringmaster and altered its crew.
   Gaea rescued them and, unable to change them back, placed them where
   they would be happy. She makes an offer to Cirocco: in exchange for
   long life and unusual abilities, she can be Gaea's agent at the Rim,
   her Wizard. Cirocco accepts, with the condition that the war between
   the Titanides and Angels must stop.

   Gaea's personality is that of a movie addict. She has been watching
   television signals from Earth and is obsessed by movies, especially
   from Hollywood's Golden Age. The Titanide-Angel war was the result of
   her having seen war movies, and realizing that humanity will inevitably
   declare war on her. The war is a way for her to practice.
