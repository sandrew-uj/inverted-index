   The novel is set in Tristopolis, a fantastic city where humans live
   side by side with zombies, wraiths, mages, witches, talking gargoyles
   and other mystical creatures. Death is a prominent theme in the culture
   of Tristopolis, with the characters using the names of Thanatos and
   Hades in place of "God", and the bones of the dead serve as the city's
   primary energy source.

   The story revolves around the police detective Donal Riordan who is
   assigned to protect the opera diva Maria daLivnova against the Black
   Circle, a group of assassins who target gifted artists with the intent
   of trafficking their bones. After Riordan fails his mission, he
   realizes that he was set up as a pawn by his higher-ups, and is
   recruited into a task force which investigates the Black Circle and
   their connection to the higher ranks of the Tristopolis society. At the
   same time, Donal falls in love with his new superior, the beautiful
   zombie woman Laura Steele, and they begin a passionate romantic
   relationship.
