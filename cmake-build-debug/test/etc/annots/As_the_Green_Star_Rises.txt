   As Karn and Klygon (betrayed by Delgan on a deserted islet) wait for
   either an inevitable end by drowning (for the Green Star has risen, and
   a tide with it--threatening to swamp the islet), they hear the swish of
   oars. Karn then calls out to the ship (just prior to losing
   consciousness) and the two are then taken on board. The ship, named
   Xothun (after a large, inland-sea-dwelling reptile) is captained by
   Blue Barbarians led by the nasty, brutish Hoggur, who sends the two
   belowdecks as slave-rowers. Their companions include select citizens of
   Komar, a peaceful mercantile kingdom recently conquered and ravaged by
   the Barbarians (under the chieftainship of a mysterious "warlord"
   immune to their racial madness) including its ruler Andar; the ship is
   on its way to Komar's ally Tharkoon to espy it out for conquest--which
   Eryon deems as foolish due to Tharkoon being ruled by a wizard. One
   day, Eryon states that they approach the Angzar Reefs, an area of
   unpredictable storms--which prompts some of the desperate Komarians to
   hope for a quick death. However, it gives Klygon some hope, and he asks
   Karn if he should pick the locks (a skill Karn did not know Klygon
   possessed). The prospect pleases Eryon and Andar, who figure on using
   their release and the storm to retake the Xothun. When the storm
   strikes, the Komarians (released by Klygon's lock-picking) storm up the
   decks and attack the Blue Barbarians. When Karn runs up to enjoy his
   first re-taste of freedom, Hoggur crashes into him; Karn jumps on
   Hoggur and strangles him--strengthened as a residual effect of the
   "Elixir Of Light", and further by sheer rage--and is then swept
   overboard. Shortly after the storm the zawkaw carrying a woman (Arjala)
   lands on the stern--and Arjala alights while the tired zawkaw takes off
   elsewhere.

   The zawkaw carrying Ralidux and the two women lands on an island. The
   two flee in opposite directions to escape Ralidux--Niamh, into a
   structure and Arjala into jungled-area. Inside the structure, Niamh
   disturbs a large serpent or ssalith and flees promptly outside. Ralidux
   has meanwhile pursued Arjala, who escapes after scratching him to
   create such opportunity; she jumps on the zawkaw to escape, then hears
   a voice calling--and wonders whether it is Niamh (whom she doesn't
   really like) or Ralidux (from whom she is fleeing in terror). Niamh
   manages to grab the bridle of the zawkaw as Arjala takes off. Ralidux,
   finding the zawkaw gone, explores further and finds a tubular craft
   which can fly--and energises it.

   In the seawater, Karn hears a voice claiming to be Shann, a young boy
   from Kamadhong (another treetop city), and swims to Shann's rescue;
   Shann guides Karn to an island. Due to certain reactions of Shann, Karn
   deduces that Shann is an adolescent girl; he starts loving her (at
   least platonically, feeling guilty for deserting Niamh). The two
   construct a hut and survive for a time. One day, Shann sees an airborne
   craft coming towards her--as Karn asks for its description, Shann is
   kidnapped by the craft's occupant.

   As described in the ending of the article By the Light of the Green
   Star, Janchan has stopped the sky-sled. Unfortunately, he stopped it
   suddenly and struck his head on the windshield--knocking him
   unconscious alongside Zarqa. When he comes to, he finds Zarqa
   conscious--and Nimbalim warning them they are in serious danger, as the
   sled is held in a xoph's web. Janchan tries cutting through the
   strands, but they are too thick, and prepares to face the xoph with his
   sword (no mean task, due to the xoph being about elephant-sized). Zarqa
   then reminisces that it would be nice if he had the zoukar, whereupon
   Janchan remembers another Kalood weapon, a vial of liquid flame. When
   Zarqa tells him that Karn had taken it, Janchan tells him of another
   which he had brought on board. he takes it out, and aims it at the
   xoph, incinerating it and setting its web on fire--which weakens it
   enough for the re-energised sky-sled to part. Zarqa then follows the
   mind-trail of Ralidux to the inland sea, and a small island where they
   continue searching till Zarqa loses the trail.

   The liberated Xothun has, meantime, reached Tharkoon where Andar asks
   its ruler Parimus for aid against the Blue Barbarians. Parimus
   confesses that he has no great fleet, but does have one large
   Kaloodha-manufactured advanced airship. The two then plan the invasion,
   from the Komarians by sea and the Tharkoonians by air. Two delays are
   then caused when a small aircraft comes in front of Parimus' airship
   and is shot down. Parimus lands the airship on an island looks to see
   if any have survived, and is reassured by Janchan and Zarqa that only
   some of the enamel was scratched--and then dispatches a group of
   warriors to help them extract the sky-sled. Travelling further over the
   island (named Narjix) with Janchan, Zarqa (and Klygon who has boarded
   the Tharkoonian ship), Parimus spots a young boy--whom Klygon
   recognises as Karn. As the Tharkoonians set down to rescue him, he is
   attacked by the ssalith--and rescued when Zarqa pursues the monster and
   makes it attack (and destroy) itself. Parimus then treats Karn's eyes,
   bandaging them with medicines, in hope of restoring his eyesight.

   Meanwhile, the Komarians aboard the Xothun, disguised as Blue
   Barbarians (but not with disguises that will pass muster under strong
   light) enter their capitol's harbour. Andar attempts to bluff his way
   past the harbour sentry and finds out (to dismay) that the Warlord has
   returned. He quickly kills the sentry, and fights his way to the palace
   where he meets the Warlord--finding the Warlord's swordplay skills to
   be as good as his own (unlike the rudimentary skills of the Blue
   Barbarians as a whole). Andar is almost killed by the Warlord, but
   narrowly escapes due to his own slipping--during which the Warlord
   slips behind a panel leading to many catacombs (where Andar does not
   pursue him, as this would take too long). The Komarians fight their way
   to the palace roof, where there is an idol of their god Koroga. At that
   point, several of the Komarians, including Ozad (from the Xothun) are
   killed by lightning blasts from a weapon (the zoukar) held by the
   Warlord--who forces Andar (and surviving supporters) to drop their
   weapons. However, at that moment, Parimus' airship arrives, and uses a
   combination of the airship's laser/electric cannon and his archers to
   inflict a reverse on the Barbarians--converted to a crushing defeat as
   the Komarians now re-grab their weapons.

   After the battle, Karn tests whether the treatment worked--and is able
   to see the Green Star rising through a gap in the planet's cloud-cover.
   Just then a tubular aircraft comes in over Komar with two occupants
   fighting in the cockpit. Janchan recognises one as Ralidux (shouting
   his name) and Karn recognises the other (by voice) as "Shann"--to be
   corrected as Janchan also sees her and shouts her real name, "Niamh".
   Niamh finishes the struggle by stabbing Ralidux with a small knife, the
   "Avenger of Chastity" (carried inside their garments by all Laonese
   women), and attempts to land the craft. Just then, Karn sees Delgan
   (the Warlord) jump inside, and a new struggle between Delgan and
   Niamh--but is too far away to help. However, one of the Tharkoonian
   archers, Zorak, jumps into the cockpit to see if he can kill the
   Warlord. As the craft flies out of Komar into the trees, Janchan and
   Zarqa follow at a distance in the sky-sled. They see a body fall from
   the craft, but cannot identify which of the three occupants fell.

   Arjala tells Karn and Janchan that Niamh had lost her grip on the
   zawkaw's bridle. Arjala, being inexperienced at controlling the huge
   bird (and also needing, in any case, to flee from Ralidux) was unable
   to rescue her from the water.

   The 1976 sequel to this novel, In the Green Star's Glow was the
   conclusion of the Green Star Series
