   Mammoth opens with the billionaire scientist Howard Christian, and his
   attempts to clone a mammoth, largely for the sake of the countless
   circuses he owns. His team finds a mammoth frozen in ice, along with
   two human beings, one of whom appears to be wearing a wristwatch. His
   assistant, Warburton, is initially convinced that this is a joke, but
   Howard takes the notion of time travel seriously, and hires physicist
   Matt Wright to study a metal briefcase which is presumably a time
   machine. Matt soon falls in love with Susan Morgan, the elephant keeper
   who is in charge of the mammoth project, who works in the same
   warehouse.

   Two religious zealots and an animal rights activist launch an attack
   against the mammoth cloners, but accidentally find themselves in
   Wright's section of the warehouse. One of them whacks the time machine,
   which, unbeknownst to him, turns on a tiny light in the machine. When
   Matt and Susan come to the lab to investigate, they are transported
   back many thousands of years, to the last major ice age. After a few
   adventures, they return, with a herd of mammoths in tow. They appear in
   the middle of Los Angeles, where all but two of the mammoths are
   slaughtered by police and a high-power laser Christian has in his
   tower. Matt leaves Susan to work out the details of time travel.

   Five years later, Susan is the trainer of the two remaining mammoths,
   Little Fuzzy and Big Mama. Matt returns, explaining that he had been
   held captive for weeks in what might have been a government facility.
   Susan reveals that she wants to free Little Fuzzy. With the help of
   another animal rights activist, Susan and Matt bring Little Fuzzy to
   Canada. When Howard and his movie star girlfriend Andrea go to retrieve
   the mammoth, they are sent back to the ice age, where they attempt to
   introduce more advanced (but still primitive) technology to the locals,
   and Little Fuzzy is allowed to go free.
