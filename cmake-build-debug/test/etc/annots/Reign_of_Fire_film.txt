   Soon after the start of the 21st century, during construction on the
   London Underground, workers penetrate a cave and a huge dragon emerges
   from hibernation, incinerating the workers with its breath. The only
   survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen
   (Alice Krige)--the project engineer--is crushed to death protecting
   him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons
   appear. Years later, Quinn (Christian Bale), now an adult, records the
   events that transpired after the first dragon sighting. Scientists
   discovered that dragons were the species responsible for the extinction
   of the dinosaurs and most plant life on the planet when they razed it
   with fire; the ash from this event caused the first Ice age before the
   dragons disappeared, presumably in a cycle of hibernation. Once
   re-emerged, the population surged to several million, prompting most
   militaries to use increasingly devastating weapons, finally leading to
   targeting the largest population areas with nuclear weapons in 2010;
   however, this only hastened the destruction, and by 2020, humans are
   nearly extinct. The dragons, now starving as well, are dying off and
   increasingly aggressive in search of food.

   Quinn, along with his best friend Creedy (Gerard Butler) leads a
   community of survivors at Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland where he
   plans to outlast dragons until they go back into hibernation; as
   insurance, he shares his notes and plans with Jared (Scott Moutter) an
   orphan he rescued as a child and is grooming to lead the community. The
   community is short on supplies and in a state of unrest pending the
   harvest of their meager crops. Eddie (David Kennedy) and his group
   steal a truck to pilfer the crops early, but they are attacked by a
   dragon. One man is killed and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn,
   Creedy, and Jared rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon
   kills Eddie's son before escaping and burns the majority of the crops,
   leaving the community without a means to feed itself.

   Shortly afterwards, a group of heavily armed Americans arrive in an
   armored convoy with a Chieftain tank and an AgustaWestland AW109
   utility helicopter. The Leader, Denton Van Zan, explains that they are
   The Kentucky Irregulars, some of the last remaining military dragon
   hunters seeking safe haven on their way to London. Initially skeptical
   and worried that they are marauders, Van Zan convinces Quinn by sharing
   the dragons' main weakness: poor vision during twilight. With Quinn's
   help, Van Zan and his team hunt and slay the dragon which destroyed the
   crops.

   The survivors enjoy a celebration at the castle that night but Van Zan
   is embittered by the loss of three of his men. Van Zan introduces Quinn
   to Alex Jensen (Izabella Scorupco), his team's helicopter pilot and
   intelligence officer and together they brief Quinn on their mission.
   After killing nearly 200 dragons, Alex discovered that they were all
   female; she postulates that they reproduce quickly because the species
   relies on a single male to fertilize the eggs. Having tracked the
   spread of the dragons, they believe that the male is located in London
   and that if they kill it, they will effectively stop dragons from
   reproducing. Although Quinn suspects that the male dragon is the same
   that killed his mother, he refuses to help knowing that London is a
   dragon stronghold and that if they fail, the dragon will track them
   back to their shelter.

   Van Zan first recruits, then "drafts" the castle's best defenders,
   including Jared, despite Quinn's objections and a physical altercation.
   Van Zan and some of the castle's men then depart, but true to Quinn's
   warnings, their caravan is attacked by the dragon in the ruins of a
   town 66 miles (106 km) from London. Everyone but Van Zan and Jensen are
   killed. The dragon then finds the castle and kills many of the
   inhabitants. Quinn gets the survivors to a bunker, but they are trapped
   when the dragon returns; during its final attack, Creedy is killed.

   Van Zan and Jensen return and free everyone trapped in the bunker.
   Quinn leaves Jared in charge and decides to help Van Zan and Alex hunt
   down the male dragon as their best chance at survival. They fly to
   London and find hundreds of small dragons, one of which is cannibalized
   by the larger male. This scatters the smaller dragons and leaves the
   male undefended. Without the support needed for a major battle, Van Zan
   coordinates a simplified plan: split up, bait the male into attacking,
   and then shoot explosives down the dragon's throat. The plan initially
   works, but the dragon manages to detonate the explosives early; Van Zan
   sacrifices himself as a distraction while Quinn and Alex gather the
   last explosives. Together, they lure the dragon to ground level, where
   Quinn fires another explosive into the dragon's mouth, killing it.

   Later, Quinn and Alex erect a radio tower on a hill overlooking the
   North Sea. There has been no dragon sighting for over three months.
   Jared arrives to say they have contacted a group of French survivors
   who want to speak to their leader. Quinn officially makes Jared the
   community leader and dedicates himself to rebuilding civilization with
   Alex.
