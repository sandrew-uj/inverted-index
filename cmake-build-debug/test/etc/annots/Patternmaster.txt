   The novel begins with the Patternmaster, Rayal, in bed with Jansee, his
   lead wife and sister. For a year, there have been no major attacks from
   the "Clayarks"; mutated humans the Patternists have been in constant
   battle against. Rayal and Jansee have two sons, Teray, the youngest,
   who is away at Redhill School, and Coransee. Patternists can connect
   with their children telepathically, and Jansee is concerned about her
   sons. To check on them, she thinks of sending a 'mute', a human without
   paranormal powers. Rayal disagrees, leading the couple to argue. Aside
   from Jansee, Rayal killed all of his siblings to become Patternmaster,
   and to lead the telepathic race through the powerful connections
   between the Patternists, known as the Pattern. The peaceful year ends
   as the Clayarks attack the Patternists. They shoot and kill Jansee and
   greatly injure Rayal, who then has to use his powers to save his own
   life instead of killing the Clayarks.

   Many years later, Teray leaves the Redhill School with his wife, Iray.
   As the couple is leaving, they encounter two Patternists; Joachim, a
   Housemaster whom Teray is apprenticed to, and Jer, an outsider. The two
   inform Teray of the recent Clayark raid, and tell him of their plans to
   visit Coransee on their way to Joachim's house. Coransee challenges
   Teray and tries to read his thoughts. Although apprentices cannot
   legally be traded, Coransee negotiates with Joachim to trade the
   talented artist Laro, for Teray--who is revealed to be Coransee's
   brother. At dinner, the couple learns that the deal has been successful
   and that Teray will be an outsider. Outsiders cannot be married or have
   children and do not control where they live. Joachim promises to try to
   fix the situation.

   After Joachim leaves, Coransee shows up at Teray and Iray's door, and
   telepathically fights and nearly kills Teray. Coransee informs him that
   they are full brothers and asks him, he being his only threat as
   Patternmaster, if he wants to control the Pattern. Teray only wants his
   freedom and his own House. Teray refuses Coransee's deal, because he
   wishes to implant controls on him, and he's made an outsider in charge
   of the mutes. Iray is no longer Teray's wife and helps him by becoming
   part of Coransee's household. Teray meets a mute woman named Suliana,
   badly beaten by an outsider named Jason, and calls in the resident
   healer, Amber, to heal her injuries. Teray plans to run away by
   educating himself about relevant terrains. Teray encounters a Clayark,
   but allows him to live and leave. Joachim brings a journeyman named
   Michael and others to Coransee's House to investigate two charges
   against him in an attempt to help Teray escape. Coransee escapes the
   charges by turning things around on Joachim, who could be charged for
   illegally trading an apprentice. Teray and Amber make plans to escape
   to Forsyth, where Michael has offered him sanctuary.

   Teray tells Iray of his plans, but she is now committed to Coransee and
   cannot leave. Teray and Amber leave, and she teaches him a quicker way
   to kill the Clayarks. Teray asks Amber to be his lead when he has his
   own House, but she declines, wanting to have her own House. Coransee
   and a party of ten find the pair. Coransee wants to take Teray to
   Forsyth to be judged by Rayal. On their travels, Teray and Amber
   discover that she is pregnant with his child, and Coransee tries to
   force them to break their link. Coransee and Teray telepathically fight
   again, and because Coransee lowers his defenses, Teray kills him. Teray
   links with the other Patternists while preparing to lead them to the
   Patternmaster's House. After they kill thousands of Clayarks, Teray
   finds Rayal in the Pattern. Rayal informs Teray that he has been
   waiting for him for years and has planned for Teray to succeed him,
   because of his healer skills.
