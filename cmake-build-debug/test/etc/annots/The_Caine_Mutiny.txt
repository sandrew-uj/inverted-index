   The story is told through the eyes of Willis Seward "Willie" Keith, an
   affluent but callow young graduate of Princeton University. Following a
   mediocre living as a nightclub piano player, he signs up for midshipman
   school at Columbia University with the United States Navy to avoid
   being drafted into the United States Army during World War II. He
   endures inner conflicts over his relationship with his domineering
   mother and with May Wynn, a beautiful red-haired nightclub singer, the
   daughter of Italian immigrants. After barely surviving a series of
   misadventures that earn him the highest number of demerits in his
   class, he is commissioned as an ensign in the Naval Reserve and
   assigned to the destroyer minesweeper U.S.S. Caine, an obsolete warship
   converted from a post-World War I-era destroyer.

   Willie, with a low opinion of the Navy, misses his ship when it leaves
   on a combat assignment. Rather than catch up with it, he plays piano
   for an admiral who has taken a shine to him. He has second thoughts
   after reading a last letter from his father, who has died of melanoma.
   But he soon forgets his guilt in the round of parties at the admiral's
   house. Eventually, he reports aboard the Caine. The ensign immediately
   disapproves of the ship's decaying condition and slovenly crew. He
   attributes these conditions to a slackness of discipline by the ship's
   longtime captain, Lieutenant Commander William De Vriess.

   Willie's lackadaisical attitude toward what he considers menial duties
   brings about a humiliating clash with De Vriess when Willie forgets to
   decode a communique announcing that De Vriess will soon be relieved. De
   Vriess is relieved by Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg, a
   strong, by-the-book figure, whom Willie at first believes to be just
   what the rusty Caine and its rough-necked crew needs. But Queeg has
   never handled a ship like this before, and he soon makes errors that he
   is unwilling to admit. The Caine is sent to San Francisco for an
   overhaul, in an admiral's hope that the captain will make further
   mistakes elsewhere. Before the ship departs, Queeg browbeats his
   officers into selling their liquor rations to him. In a breach of
   regulations, Queeg smuggles the liquor off the ship, and when it is
   lost, he blackmails Willie into paying for it. Willie sees May on
   leave, and after unsuccessfully attempting to seduce her, decides he
   has no future with a woman of a lower social class. He resolves to let
   the relationship die by not replying to her letters.

   As the Caine begins its missions under his command, Queeg loses the
   respect of the crew and the loyalty of the wardroom through a series of
   incidents. Tensions aboard the ship cause Queeg to isolate himself from
   the other officers, who snub him as unworthy, believing him an
   oppressive coward. At one point, during the invasion of Kwajalein,
   Queeg is ordered to escort low-lying landing craft to their line of
   departure. But instead, Queeg orders the Caine to throw over a yellow
   dye marker to mark the spot, and the Caine hastily leaves the battle
   area. The officers nickname Queeg "Old Yellowstain", a nickname that
   implies cowardice.

   The dynamic, intellectual communications officer, Lieutenant Thomas
   Keefer, who had initially coined the nickname of "Old Yellowstain" for
   Queeg, suggests to the Caine's executive officer, the dutiful
   Lieutenant Stephen Maryk, that Queeg might be mentally ill. Keefer
   directs Maryk to "Section 184" of the Navy Regulations, under which a
   subordinate can relieve a commanding officer in extraordinary
   circumstances.
