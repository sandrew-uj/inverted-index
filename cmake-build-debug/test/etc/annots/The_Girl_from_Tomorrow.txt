   In the year 3000, the human race is in a state of Utopia. The major
   challenge facing them is continuing rebuilding the Earth after "The
   Great Disaster", a catastrophic event that took place in 2500 and
   nearly destroyed the entire Earth. In order to investigate its causes,
   a scientist named Tulista is sent to the past using the Time Capsule, a
   device created by a scientist named Bruno. Upon the capsule's return,
   Tulista is held hostage by Silverthorn, a criminal from the year 2500,
   who is intent on conquering the future. Realizing that even though the
   year 3000 does not have weapons per se, his own weapons are no match to
   the superior technology of the Transducer, he manages to take Alana,
   Tulista's student, hostage, and escapes into the past, where he figures
   he will have a better chance. Arriving in 1990, Alana escapes, and
   later meets a teenager named Jenny Kelly, whose help she enlists in
   order to get back to the Capsule before it returns automatically to the
   future, leaving her stranded in the past. After thinking that the
   Capsule was destroyed, Jenny and Alana discover that it has been seized
   by Silverthorn, who is building his power and making vast amounts of
   money by using information from the Capsule's database, and will
   therefore not allow Alana to use it to return to her own time. Along
   with the help of Jenny's family and her teacher, Alana and Jenny must
   devise a plan to retrieve the Capsule while foiling Silverthorn's
   plans, so that Alana can return home to the year 3000.
