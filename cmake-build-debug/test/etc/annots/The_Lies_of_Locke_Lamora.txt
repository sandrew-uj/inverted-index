   The Gentleman Bastards are masters of deception, disguise and fine
   cuisine. Father Chains, their "garrista" (leader), is a priest of the
   Crooked Warden, the god of thieves. He buys troublesome youth Locke for
   his gang. Through a series of confidence tricks on the rich, they defy
   the Secret Peace, an unspoken agreement between the criminal
   underground and the Duke's government which allows for the existence of
   organized crime with the understanding that the peerage and the
   servants of justice are off limits. After Chains' death, Locke becomes
   garrista of the group, consisting of Jean Tannen, an expert fighter;
   Calo and Galdo Sanza, jack-of-all-trades identical twins; and Bug, a
   young apprentice. Their wayward female associate Sabetha is mentioned,
   but resides elsewhere during the events of the novel.

   The criminal underworld of Camorr is ruled with an iron fist by the
   Capa Barsavi, who collects a commission on all criminal activity under
   his purview. Under Locke's leadership, the Gentleman Bastards are known
   as a small gang of gentrified but petty thieves and pickpockets, and
   their dues, though regularly paid, are relatively small. Secretly, the
   Bastards have actually been using elaborate schemes to swindle various
   nobles out of large sums, and have amassed a considerable fortune; they
   purchase the trinkets they pass on to Barsavi as tribute, in accordance
   with their small-time reputation. What little is spoken of their
   operations is credited to the shadowy "Thorn of Camorr."

   Locke pretends to be Lukas Fehrwight, a merchant from Emberlain,^[3] to
   con Don Lorenzo Salvara and his wife. Meanwhile, a mysterious criminal
   calling himself the Gray King has been killing Barsavi's most trusted
   garristas; fearing for his safety, Barsavi has sequestered himself in
   his ship-fortress, the Floating Grave. Locke finds himself face to face
   with the Gray King and his hired Bondsmage "The Falconer", who somehow
   know what the Gentleman Bastards have been up to; Locke agrees to
   impersonate the Gray King in an arranged meeting with Barsavi in
   exchange for the Gray King's silence, as well as the Bondsmage's
   magical protection from Barsavi's wrath during the meeting. The Gray
   King murders Barsavi's daughter Nazca and delivers her body to the Capa
   in a barrel of horse urine; Locke is forced to continue with the plan,
   even though he knows that now Barsavi will never negotiate.

   At the meeting, Barsavi manages to circumvent a disguised Locke's
   magical protection, having him severely beaten and left to drown in a
   barrel. Jean and Bug save him, but they realize that the Gray King has
   double-crossed them; they return to their secret lair and find their
   wealth stolen and the Sanza twins brutally murdered. An intruder kills
   Bug and nearly Jean and Locke, who swear revenge. Locke goes to the
   Floating Grave in disguise, where Barsavi is celebrating the Gray
   King's supposed death. Suddenly two of Barsavi's trusted bodyguards,
   the fierce Berengias sisters, turn on him and cut down Barsavi and his
   two sons. The Gray King (whom Locke deduces is the brother of the
   Berengias twins) appears, introduces himself as Capa Raza and claims
   Barsavi's empire as his own.

   Left without resources and needing funds to somehow strike back at
   Raza, Locke tries to complete the con against the Salvaras. Meanwhile,
   Jean investigates the after-dark activity of Raza's minions and
   realizes that the new Capa is secretly loading his newfound wealth onto
   a ship supposedly quarantined for plague. Before Jean can tell Locke,
   he is ambushed by the Berengias sisters. He manages to kill both, but
   is seriously wounded himself. The Duke's "Spider", Camorr's secret
   spymaster who is actually the elderly Dona Vorchenza, has learned that
   the Salvaras are being conned by the mysterious "Thorn of Camorr." She
   and the Salvaras lure Locke to the Duke's annual celebration, and he
   barely escapes. Returning to their hideout, Locke finds Jean
   incapacitated by the Bondsmage's sorcery, which relies on the use of
   Jean's true name. Locke, whose real name is not known, overpowers the
   Falconer and tortures him for information. Wary of revenge by other
   Bondsmages should he be killed, Jean and Locke remove his fingers and
   tongue so he cannot gesture or speak spells, leaving him alive but
   insane.

   Capa Raza has planned his revenge against Barsavi and the nobles of
   Camorr since childhood, when his parents were murdered as collateral
   damage from the Secret Peace. To destroy the peers, he gives the Duke
   of Camorr four sculptures, actually time bombs filled with a substance
   that will cause all of the nobles and their children present at the
   celebration to slide into permanent mindlessness. Locke races back to
   the tower from which he escaped and manages to convince Vorchenza and
   the Salvaras of the danger, and the devices are defused. He next
   coerces the Spider to set him free to kill Raza, and not put him on
   trial for theft as a reward for saving their lives. Vorchenza agrees
   when Locke has shared the location of the stolen money; he tells her
   that Raza has hidden his treasure on a waste barge, and instructs her
   to destroy the plague ship and its crew before Raza can use it to
   infect the city. Locke faces Raza in mortal combat even though he is
   outmatched by the Capa's skills with a sword, and is nearly killed
   before managing to distract Raza for the split second he needs to
   finally slay him. When no treasure is found on the barge, Vorchenza
   realizes that the Thorn tricked her into destroying the ship filled
   with Raza's fortune, which is now an offering to the god of thieves for
   Locke's murdered friends. Later, Jean and Locke, recovering from their
   injuries, sail away to a new life.
