   Military tensions rise between the two Cold War powers led by the
   Soviet Union and the United States. Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact forces
   build on the border between East Germany and West Germany, and West
   Berlin is blockaded. A NATO attempt to break the blockade results in
   heavy casualties. Airman First Class Billy McCoy (William Allen Young)
   lives at Whiteman Air Force Base near Sedalia, Missouri. He is called
   to alert status at the Minuteman launch site he is stationed at in
   Sweetsage, Missouri, 20 miles from Kansas City. The Hendry family lives
   on a farm adjoining McCoy's launch site.

   The Dahlberg family lives on their farm twenty miles away from the
   Sweetsage launch site, in Harrisonville, Missouri, 40 miles from Kansas
   City. The Dahlbergs' eldest daughter Denise (Lori Lethin) is set to be
   married in two days to a student at the University of Kansas, and they
   perform their wedding dress rehearsal.

   The next day, the military conflict in Europe rapidly escalates.
   Tactical nuclear weapons are detonated by NATO to stop a Soviet Union
   advance into West Germany, and each side attacks naval targets in the
   Persian Gulf. Dr. Russell Oakes (Jason Robards), a doctor in Kansas
   City, Missouri, travels to Lawrence, Kansas by car to teach a class at
   the University of Kansas hospital there. Pre-med University of Kansas
   student Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg) receives a physical at the
   hospital, hears the news from Europe, and decides to hitchhike toward
   home in Joplin, Missouri.

   As the threat of large-scale nuclear attack grows, hoarding begins, and
   so does evacuation of major cities in both the Soviet Union and United
   States. Frequent Emergency Broadcast System warnings are sent over
   television and radio, and Kansas City begins to empty, outbound
   freeways clogged. Dr. Oakes is among the many stuck in the traffic jam
   as he drives toward Lawrence, but, after hearing an EBS alert and
   realizing the danger to Kansas City and his family living there,
   decides to turn around and head home.

   Minutes apart, the United States launches its Minuteman missiles, and
   United States military personnel aboard the EC-135 Looking Glass
   aircraft track inbound Soviet nuclear missiles. The film deliberately
   leaves unclear who fired theirs first. Billy McCoy flees the site he
   was stationed at now that its Minuteman missile has been launched,
   intending to locate his wife and child. As air raid sirens go off,
   widespread panic grips Kansas City as most people frantically seek
   fallout shelters and other protection from the imminent Soviet nuclear
   attack.
   A nuclear weapon detonates near Fort Riley, Kansas

   High-yield nuclear weapons detonate over numerous locations, including
   downtown Kansas City, Sedalia, and Sweetsage. The explosions cause
   electromagnetic pulses, disabling vehicles and destroying the
   electrical grid, moments before heat and blast waves destroy and
   vaporize everything nearby. The Hendry family, having initially ignored
   the crisis, is killed when they try to flee. McCoy takes refuge in a
   truck trailer, and Klein, who had hitchhiked as far as Harrisonville,
   finds the Dahlberg home and begs for protection in the family's
   basement. Dr. Oakes, who witnessed the nuclear explosion over Kansas
   City, walks to the hospital in Lawrence and begins treating patients.

   Nuclear fallout and its deadly effects are felt everywhere in the
   region. McCoy and Oakes, both outside immediately after the explosions,
   have been exposed without their knowledge to lethal doses of radiation.
   Denise Dahlberg, frantic after days in the family's basement shelter,
   runs outside, and Klein, who vows to her father that he'll bring her
   back, does so, but not before both have been exposed to very high doses
   of radiation. McCoy learns in his travels that Sedalia and many other
   cities have been obliterated. Food and water are in very short supply,
   and looting and other criminal activity leads to the imposition of
   martial law. Klein takes Denise and her brother Danny, who was blinded
   by one of the nuclear explosions, to the hospital in Lawrence for
   treatment. McCoy also travels there, where he dies of radiation
   poisoning. Denise and Danny Dahlberg, and Klein, finally leave for
   Harrisonville and the Dahlberg farm, when it becomes clear to them they
   can't be treated medically for their injuries.

   Jim Dahlberg, returning home from a municipal meeting about
   agricultural techniques that may work to grow food in the new
   circumstances, finds squatters on the farm. He explains that it is his
   land, and asks them to leave, at which point one of the squatters
   shoots and kills him without any sign of remorse.

   Dr. Oakes, at last aware he has sustained lethal exposure to radiation,
   returns to Kansas City on foot to see the site of his home before he
   dies. He finds squatters there, attempts to drive them off, and is
   instead offered food. Oakes collapses, weeps, and one of the squatters
   comforts him.

   The film ends as Lawrence science faculty head Joe Huxley repeatedly
   tries to contact other survivors with a shortwave radio. There is no
   response.
