   The Armstrong Classic is a rocket race throughout the inhabited solar
   system and has become the driving force for the advancement of rocket
   and space technologies. It is extremely dangerous, and there are always
   fatalities, but it is regarded as the trial that proves the merit of a
   prospective spaceman. It is said that "only a fool would enter such a
   race, and only a genius or a Martian could win". In a twist of fate, a
   young man, Jerry Blaine is kicked out of the Space Institute at his
   brother's request to help him get ready for the 18th Armstrong Classic.
   When his brother is injured in a fueling accident, Jerry must take over
   command of the Last Hope and try to win the Classic for earth.
