   The book portrays Yefremov's conception of a classic communist utopia
   set in a distant future. Throughout the novel, the author's attention
   is focused on the social and cultural aspects of the society, and the
   struggle to conquer vast cosmic distances. There are several principal
   heroes, including a starship captain, two scientists, a historian, and
   an archeologist. Though the world described in the novel is intended to
   be ideal, there is an attempt to show a conflict and its resolution
   with a voluntary self-punishment of a scientist whose reckless
   experiment caused damage. There's also a fair amount of action in the
   episodes where the crew of the starship fight alien predators.

   In the novel, several civilizations across our galaxy, including Earth,
   are united in the Great Circle, whose members exchange and relay
   scientific and cultural information. Notably, faster-than-light travel
   or communication does not exist in the time portrayed in the book, and
   one of the minor plot lines examines a failed attempt to overcome this
   limitation. The radio transmissions around the Great Circle are
   pictured as requiring a tremendous amount of energy, and are thus
   infrequent.

   One of the main plot lines follows the crew of the spacecraft Tantra
   led by Captain Erg Noor, dispatched to investigate the sudden radio
   silence of one of the nearby Great Circle planets. The crew travels to
   the planet, and discovers that most life on it has been destroyed by
   unsafe experimentation with radioactivity. On their return journey, the
   Tantra is scheduled to meet a carrier spacecraft to refuel, but the
   second ship does not make the rendezvous. The crew attempts the return
   voyage with meager fuel, but is trapped by the gravitational field of
   an "iron star" (some form of compact star in modern terms). The crew
   lands on one of its planets, where they discover the wreck of a
   previous expedition, as well as a mysterious alien spacecraft. After
   fighting off the native life-form, the crew retrieve the remaining fuel
   supplies from the wreck and succeed in returning to earth.

   The second major plot line follows Darr Veter, the director of the
   global space agency as he makes way for a successor and then attempt to
   find a new job for himself. When his successor voluntarily steps down
   as punishment for a daring experiment that goes wrong, Veter returns to
   the position. The book closes with the launch of a new expedition, once
   again led by Noor, to a pair of new planets that offer the possibility
   of human colonisation. It is a bittersweet ending, as the cosmonauts
   themselves will not live long enough to return.
