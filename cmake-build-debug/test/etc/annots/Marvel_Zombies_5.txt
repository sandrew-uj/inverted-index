   Morbius charges fellow A.R.M.O.R. agents, Machine Man and Howard the
   Duck, with retrieving different samples of zombies from each reality so
   that he can find a cure for his infected friend, Jacob Russell. Through
   their travel they are joined by Jacali Kane, the daughter of
   supervillain Harry Kane, also known as Hurricane whom before his death,
   transferred his powers to her.

   The team travels through 5 realities. Each reality has its own version
   of the virus, mimicking a popular horror movie (Romero, Raimi, Boyle,
   etc.), featuring guest appearances from various Marvel figures from the
   Wild West, Killraven, Ultron, Thor, Jocasta and Arno Stark (future Iron
   Man, deceased).

   Hurricane, his daughter, and Machine Man killed some zombies, but a
   group of revived zombies killed Hurricane.

   Howard the Duck assembled Dum Dum Dugan and other uninfected people to
   perform Ducky's Dozen.

   They got Killraven and Old Skull to join in with them. When Old Skull
   was bitten on the arm, his friends had no choice but to amputate his
   infected arm to prevent him to overpower his own friends as a new
   zombie, which is successful.
