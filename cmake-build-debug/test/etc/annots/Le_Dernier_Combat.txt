   The film opens to a shot of an abandoned office, where the main
   character (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the
   end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then
   seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns
   to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift
   aircraft. The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in,
   which is surrounded by a desert wasteland. A group of men are shown
   surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice
   Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The Man, who
   has been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs
   their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery.
   Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now
   completed aircraft.

   'The Brute' (Jean Reno) is seen approaching a hospital with a box
   containing canned food. The Brute rings a bell, and 'The Doctor' (Jean
   Bouise), instructs him to place the canned goods on the ground and back
   away from the door. The Doctor then takes the goods and closes the door
   before The Brute can get inside.

   The Man's aircraft crash lands at night. The following morning he
   continues on foot. The Brute returns to the hospital with a new box of
   items, though this time he constructs a device that will keep the door
   open long enough for him to enter the building. The plan works,
   however, once back inside the building The Doctor pulls a lever which
   closes a secondary iron bar gate preventing The Brute from entering.
   The Man finds an abandoned bar, gets himself heavily intoxicated and
   passes out. When he awakes, he ventures outside where he is amazed that
   it is raining fish. While searching for a way to cook the fish, The Man
   encounters The Brute. A fight ensues; the Brute gains the upper hand
   though The Man is able to escape.

   The Man, now badly injured, wanders around until he finds The Doctor.
   The Doctor treats The Man and cooks him some fish. The Doctor inhales a
   form of gas that allows him to, with some difficulty, say a single
   word: Bonjour. The Man also takes the gas and is able to reply with the
   same word. Both are ecstatic about being able to speak. The Man and the
   Doctor bond over table tennis and painting, before The Man ventures
   outside into a sandstorm to retrieve a painting he found in the bar.
   The Brute, who has been living in the bar, returns and notices the
   painting is missing.

   The Doctor prepares some food and blindfolds The Man. He leads The Man
   to a part of the hospital where a woman is kept, and gives her the
   food. The Brute sets fire to the front door of the hospital, though The
   Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to
   bring food to the woman again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift.
   They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate,
   though are able to scare him off.

   The Doctor and The Man prepare food for the woman, yet this time The
   Doctor permits the man to not be blindfolded, and encourages him to
   comb his hair. Meanwhile, it is revealed that The Brute has breached
   the iron gate to the hospital. The Doctor is killed on the way to the
   woman when chunks of rock rain down from the sky. The Man, who does not
   know how to find the woman without The Doctor, attempts to locate her,
   though he is confronted by The Brute. A fight ensues, with The Man
   eventually killing The Brute. The Man then locates the woman's room,
   though is devastated when he discovers that The Brute had already
   killed her.

   The Man repairs his aircraft, and flies back to the original survivors
   he encountered. He kills their new leader and frees The Dwarf. The
   Dwarf shows the Man where The Captain keeps his concubine (Christiane
   Krueger). The Man greets her with a warm smile, which she returns.
