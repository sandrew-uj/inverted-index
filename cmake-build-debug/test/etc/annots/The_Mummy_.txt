   The Mummy! A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century is an 1827 three-volume
   novel written by Jane Webb (later Jane C. Loudon). It concerns the
   Egyptian mummy of Cheops, who is brought back to life in the year 2126.
   The novel describes a future filled with advanced technology,^[1] and
   was the first English-language story to feature a reanimated mummy.^[2]

   After her father's death, making her an orphan at the age of 17, Webb
   found that:^[3]

     on the winding up of his affairs that it would be necessary to do
     something for my support. I had written a strange, wild novel,
     called the Mummy, in which I had laid the scene in the twenty-second
     century, and attempted to predict the state of improvement to which
     this country might possibly arrive.

   She may have drawn inspiration from the general fashion for anything
   pharaonic, inspired by the French researches during the Napoleonic
   invasion of Egypt; the 1821 public unwrappings of Egyptian mummies in a
   theatre near Piccadilly, which she may have attended as a girl; and,
   very likely, the 1818 novel by Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; or, The
   Modern Prometheus.^[4] As Shelley had written of Frankenstein's
   creation, "A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous
   as that wretch," which may have triggered young Miss Webb's later
   concept. In any case, at many points she deals in greater clarity with
   elements from the earlier book: the loathing for the much-desired
   object, the immediate arrest for crime and attempt to lie one's way out
   of it, etc.^[4] However, unlike the Frankenstein monster, the hideous
   revived Cheops is not shuffling around dealing out horror and death,
   but giving canny advice on politics and life to those who befriend
   him.^[4] In some ways The Mummy! may be seen as her reaction to themes
   in Frankenstein: her mummy specifically says he is allowed life only by
   divine favour, rather than being indisputably vivified only by mortal
   science, and so on, as Hopkins' 2003 essay covers in detail.^[4]

   Unlike many early science fiction works (Shelley's The Last Man, and
   The Reign of King George VI, 1900-1925, written anonymously in
   1763^[5]), Loudon did not portray the future as her own day with only
   political changes. She filled her world with foreseeable changes in
   technology, society, and even fashion. Her court ladies wear trousers
   and hair ornaments of controlled flame. Surgeons and lawyers may be
   steam-powered automatons. A kind of Internet is predicted in it.
   Besides trying to account for the revivification of the mummy in
   scientific terms--galvanic shock rather than incantations--"she
   embodied ideas of scientific progress and discovery, that now read like
   prophecies"^[6] to those later down the 19th century. Her social
   attitudes have resulted in this book being ranked among feminist
   novels.

   The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century was published
   anonymously in 1827 by Henry Colburn in three volumes, as was usual in
   that day so that each small volume could be easily carried around. It
   drew many favourable reviews, including one in 1829 in The Gardener's
   Magazine on the inventions proposed in it. In 1830, the reviewer, John
   Claudius Loudon, sought out Webb, and they married the next year.
