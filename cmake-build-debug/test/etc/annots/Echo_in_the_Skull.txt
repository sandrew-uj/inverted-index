   Echo in the Skull, 1959:

   Sometime in the late 1950s, Sally Ercott awakens from a drunken stupor
   in a filthy room in a sleazy boarding house on Mamble Row in the
   Paddington section of London. She is destitute and suffering from
   amnesia and the proprietors of the house, Arthur and Bella Rowall,
   eagerly await the day when she agrees to work for them as a prostitute.
   She goes outside and is overwhelmed by one of the waking nightmares
   that have driven her down. In her inattention, she is nearly hit by a
   car.

   The driver of the car, Nick Jenkins, notices her plight and insists on
   taking her to lunch. Then he takes her to his apartment, where she can
   bathe while he goes out and buys her new clothes. When he returns, Nick
   calls a doctor, his friend Tom Gospell, and asks him to come and
   examine Sally. As they wait for Dr. Gospell, Sally and Nick discuss her
   nightmares and infer that they seem like actual memories of girls and
   women dying on alien worlds.

   After Dr. Gospell examines Sally and finds nothing wrong with her, Nick
   goes out to do more shopping. He is kidnapped by Arthur Rowall and
   taken to the boarding house, where Bella guards him as Arthur goes to
   kidnap Sally. Clyde West, another resident of the boarding house, helps
   Nick escape and tie Bella up. With his penknife Nick cuts Bella's dress
   and exposes a greenish parasite spread across her back. Leaving Bella
   bound to a chair, the men hurry to Nick's apartment to prevent Arthur
   from kidnapping Sally. They are too late, but Dr. Gospell calls and
   Nick tells him to meet Clyde and him at the boarding house.

   At the boarding house Nick and Clyde see that Mrs. Ramsey, another
   tenant, has freed Bella and that a policeman is taking Bella's
   complaint. Bella points to Nick and Clyde as the men who attacked her,
   but before the policeman can react Dr. Gospell arrives and takes
   command of the situation, declaring that Bella is delusional and that
   he will treat her. After Dr. Gospell has injected novocaine into the
   parasite, Nick gets him and Clyde to help him break into the sitting
   room.

   Inside, they find Sally, in a kind of stupor, lying naked on the couch
   with Arthur kneeling on the floor next to her. The parasite on Arthur's
   back has extended a pseudopod toward Sally's back. Nick charges into
   the room and knocks Arthur over, then brings Sally out of her stupor
   and helps her dress. Sally leads the men to the basement, where they
   see a much larger version of the parasite. At that moment Inspector
   Dougherty arrives and demands an explanation.

   When they return to the sitting room they see that Arthur's parasite
   has pulled out of his body and is forming into a sphere, leaving Arthur
   dead. Warned by Sally, Dougherty wraps the sphere in his coat, takes it
   outside, and puts into a trash can just before it explodes. Shaken, he
   returns to the sitting room and Sally explains.

   Relying on her acquired memories, the waking nightmares that had
   plagued her, Sally tells the men that the creatures, called the Yem,
   are sentient parasites that have learned to propel their spores into
   space, where they ride the radiation winds of the stars to spread their
   kind across the galaxy in an act of panspermia. Now that Scotland Yard
   has been alerted to the danger all of humanity can be warned and the
   Yem attempt to take over Earth can be thwarted.

   Give Warning to the World, 1974:

   The plot of Give Warning to the World differs from that of Echo in the
   Skull in:
     * 1. Arthur Rowall becomes Alfred Rowall, and Bella Rowall, in
       addition to the squalid boarding house on Mamble Row, has an
       apartment in Soho where she plies her trade as a prostitute
       specializing in sadomasochism.
     * 2. The police have the Rowalls under surveillance on a suspicion of
       something, they know not what, having to do with missing people. In
       Echo in the Skull the police did not get involved until the very
       end.
     * 3. Brunner introduces a new character, Richard Argyle, an
       incompetent and corrupt doctor who has one of the parasites on his
       back. He works for Bella Rowall and keeps Sally drugged. Sally is
       more explicitly kept imprisoned in the boarding house.
     * 4. Clyde West, now a Jamaican rather than an Australian, helps
       Sally escape from the boarding house instead of helping Nick escape
       from Bella when she is about to shoot him.
     * 5. Instead of Arthur Rowall kidnapping Nick and then going back to
       Nick's place to kidnap Sally, Alfred Rowall and two accomplices
       kidnap Sally when she and Nick return to his apartment from having
       dinner. The thugs fail to kidnap Nick because Clyde intervenes,
       thereby setting up the final act when Nick, Clyde, and Tom Gospell
       raid the boarding house.
     * 6. The explosion of the frustrated Yem destroys the entire boarding
       house and not just a trash can.
