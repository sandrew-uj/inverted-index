   War between Earth and insectoid-dominated Alpha III ended over a decade
   ago. (According to the novel, "Alphane" refers to the nearest star to
   our own system, Alpha Centauri). Some years after the end of
   hostilities, Earth intends to secure its now independent colony in the
   Alphane system, Alpha III M2. As a former satellite-based global
   psychiatric institution for colonists on other Alphane system worlds
   unable to cope with the stresses of colonisation, the inhabitants of
   Alpha III M2 have lived peacefully for years. But, under the pretence
   of a medical mission, Earth intends to take their colony back.

   Against this background, Chuck Rittersdorf and his wife Mary are
   separating. Although they think they are going their separate ways,
   they soon find themselves together again on Alpha III M2. Mary travels
   there through government work, Chuck sees it as a chance to kill Mary
   using his remote control simulacrum. Along the way he is guided by his
   Ganymedean slime mould neighbour Lord Running Clam and Mary finds
   herself manipulated by the Alphane sympathiser, comedian Bunny Hentman.
