   The Book of the New Sun (1980-1983) is a series of four science fantasy
   novels, a tetralogy or single four-volume novel written by the
   American author Gene Wolfe. It inaugurated the so-called "Solar Cycle"
   that Wolfe continued by setting other works in the same universe.

   Gene Wolfe had originally intended the story to be a 40,000-word
   novella called "The Feast of Saint Catherine", meant to be published in
   one of the Orbit anthologies, but during the writing, it continued to
   grow. Despite being published with a year between each book,
   all four books were written and completed during his free time without
   anyone's knowledge when he was still an editor of Plant Engineering,
   allowing him to write at his own pace and take his time.

   The tetralogy chronicles the journey of Severian, a journeyman torturer
   who is disgraced and forced to wander. It is a first-person narrative,
   ostensibly translated by Wolfe into contemporary English, set in a
   distant future when the Sun has dimmed and Earth is cooler (a "Dying
   Earth" story). Severian lives in a nation called the Commonwealth,
   ruled by the Autarch, in the Southern Hemisphere. It is at war with
   Ascia, its northern neighbor, which is extremely totalitarian. In the
   ocean are mountain-sized aliens that want to enslave humanity and have
   succeeded in controlling Ascia.

   In 1998, Locus magazine ranked the tetralogy number three among 36
   all-time best fantasy novels before 1990, based on a poll of
   subscribers.
