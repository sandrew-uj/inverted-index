   John Buchan wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps while he was ill in bed with a
   duodenal ulcer, an illness which remained with him all his life.
   Buchan's son, William, later wrote that the name of the book originated
   when the author's daughter was counting the stairs at St Cuby, a
   private nursing home on Cliff Promenade in Broadstairs, where Buchan
   was convalescing. "There was a wooden staircase leading down to the
   beach. My sister, who was about six, and who had just learnt to count
   properly, went down them and gleefully announced: there are 39 steps."
   There were actually 78, but he halved the number to make a better
   title. When the original steps were later replaced, one of them,
   complete with a brass plaque, was sent to Buchan. They were
   replaced by concrete, and this set, now numbering 108, still runs from
   the garden to the beach.

   The novel was his first "shocker", as he called it--a story combining
   personal and political dramas. It marked a turning point in Buchan's
   literary career and introduced his adventuring hero Richard Hannay. He
   described a "shocker" as an adventure where the events in the story are
   unlikely and the reader is only just able to believe that they really
   happened.
