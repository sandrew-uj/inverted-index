   Gormenghast /|gO:rm@ngA:st/ is a fantasy series by British author
   Mervyn Peake, about the inhabitants of Castle Gormenghast, a sprawling,
   decaying, Gothic structure. Originally conceived as a single on-going
   novel, the series was ended by Peake's death and comprises three novels
   - Titus Groan (1946), Gormenghast (1950) and Titus Alone (1959) - and a
   novella, Boy in Darkness (1956), whose canonical status is debated.^[1]
   Peake was writing a fourth novel, Titus Awakes, at the time of his
   death in 1968; the book was later completed by Peake's widow Maeve
   Gilmore in the early 1970s. After it was discovered by their family, it
   was published in 2009.

   Although the first two instalments do not contain any overtly
   fantastical elements, Gormenghast is almost unanimously categorised as
   fantasy because of the atmosphere and pseudo-medieval setting.^[2]^[3]
   The series has received widespread acclaim from the speculative fiction
   community and mainstream literary critics -- Harold Bloom argues that
   it is a more accomplished work than the contemporary and better-known
   The Lord of the Rings.^[4]^[citation needed]

   The series has been included in Fantasy: The 100 Best Books, Modern
   Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels and 100 Must Read Fantasy Novels as one of
   the greatest fantasy works of the twentieth century. Literary critic
   Harold Bloom has praised the series as the best fantasy novels of the
   twentieth century and one of the greatest sequences in modern world
   literature.^[4] Gormenghast is often credited as the first fantasy of
   manners novel.^[5]^[6] The books have been translated into over twenty
   languages.^[7]
