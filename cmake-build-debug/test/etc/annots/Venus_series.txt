   The Amtor or Venus Series is a science fantasy series consisting of
   four novels and one novelette written by American author Edgar Rice
   Burroughs. Most of the stories were first serialized in Argosy, an
   American pulp magazine. It is sometimes known as the Carson Napier of
   Venus Series, after its main character, Carson Napier. Napier attempted
   a solo voyage to Mars, but, because of mistaken navigational
   calculations, he finds himself heading toward the planet Venus instead.
   The novels, part of the Sword and Planet subgenre of science fiction,
   follow earthman Napier's fantastic adventures after he crash-lands on
   Venus, called Amtor by its human-like inhabitants. Unlike Barsoom, the
   desert planet of Mars, these stories are set upon a waterworld like
   Earth. Most of the events of the series take place on the island of
   Vepaja, the kingdom of Korva on the island of Anlap, and the
   city-states of Havatoo and Kormor on the tropical continent north of
   Vepaja.

   As is common in Burroughs' works, the hero is bold and daring, and
   quickly wins the heart of the Vepajan princess (or janjong) Duare,
   though class prejudices long inhibit her from expressing her love.
   Napier meets many varied peoples, including the Vepajans, refugees from
   an overthrown empire; the Thorists, thinly disguised communists who ran
   the Vepajans out of what is now the Thoran empire; pirates; the
   super-scientific eugenicists of Havatoo; the zombies of Kormor; the
   fascistic Zanis of Korva; and the hideous Cloud People.

   In the course of his adventures within the series, Napier becomes a
   pirate (twice), escapes from the dread Room of the Seven Doors, and is
   finally made a prince, or tanjong, of Korva after the overthrow of the
   Zanis. Napier also rescues princesses from incomparable dangers
   innumerable times.
