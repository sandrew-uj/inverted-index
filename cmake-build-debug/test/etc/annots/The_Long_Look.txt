   Tymon the Black, known widely as an evil magician, is understandably
   misunderstood. He suffers the curse of "the long look," giving him
   glimpses of terrible futures that will inevitably come to pass unless
   he intervenes in the present. Haunted by the horrible consequences of
   inaction, he does what he must, ably assisted by his dwarfish assistant
   Seb. Alas, his interventions often affect innocent, or seemingly
   innocent, bystanders; some might also, if executed with insufficient
   finesse, result in outcomes even worse than those he sought to prevent.
   Hence his unenviable reputation.

   Tymon's current intervention involves engineering the death of the
   headstrong glory-hound Prince Daras of Borasur, who will otherwise
   blunder his country and its neighbors into a devastating war.
   Casualties are his reluctant fiance Princess Ashesa of Morushe,
   guilt-ridden over being the instrument of Daras's demise, and the
   prince's admiring younger brother Galan, now obsessed with vengeance.
   Between them they might well stir up troubles far worse than those
   Tymon has forestalled.

   Unfortunately, the only solution is further meddling. A complicated
   sequence of events follows involving Ashesa, Galan, Seb, and many
   others, including the scheming Duke Laras, Laras's even more scheming
   henchman Vor, aged puppet-pretender to Borasur's throne Lord Molic, the
   servant Takren, who is more than he seems, the interfering goddess
   Amaet, a young man named Korik, who finds himself drafted as Tymon's
   apprentice, and a nameless fiend called up by Galan that needs to be
   banished.
