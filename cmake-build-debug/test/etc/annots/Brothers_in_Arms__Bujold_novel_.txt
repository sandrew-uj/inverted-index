   Shortly after rescuing thousands of prisoners of war from the
   Cetagandans, as detailed in the novella "Borders of Infinity", Admiral
   Miles Naismith and his Dendarii mercenaries arrive on Earth, fleeing
   Cetagandan retribution and needing to repair the resultant damage to
   their ships.

   Miles visits the Barrayaran Embassy in London to obtain payment for
   their last mission. He reports to Captain Duv Galeni, his Imperial
   Security superior and a Komarran whose aunt was one of the victims of
   an infamous massacre of civilians allegedly committed by Miles' father.
   As the funds will have to come from the nearest sector headquarters in
   another star system, Miles resumes his real identity as Lieutenant
   Vorkosigan and is assigned to the embassy as third assistant military
   attache, under Galeni's command. He finds his cousin Ivan Vorpatril is
   the second assistant attache. Galeni later mysteriously disappears.

   During his wait, Miles is abducted, and his place taken by a clone
   created and trained as an assassin by Komarran diehards determined to
   free their planet. The Komarrans are led by Ser Galen, Galeni's own
   father who had been presumed killed while fighting against the
   Barrayarans. Miles is locked up with Galeni, who has been interrogated
   using drugs, but has resisted attempts by his father to get him to join
   the Komarran resistance. Miles himself gets a dose of fast-penta, the
   truth drug used in related stories, but his reaction to it is
   idiosyncratic. Instead of becoming docile, he becomes manic, reciting
   military manuals, poems and plays from memory to beat the
   interrogation. Meeting his clone, Miles tells him that he could claim
   his rights as Miles's brother under Betan law. Just before Miles and
   Galeni are to be executed, they are rescued by his Dendarii subordinate
   (and lover) Elli Quinn.

   Galen captures Vorpatril and uses him to force a tense meeting in the
   bowels of the Thames Barrier with Miles, who unexpectedly brings along
   Galeni. Galen disarms them, then orders the clone to kill Miles.
   However, the talks Miles has had with his clone bear fruit. The clone
   shoots and kills Galen instead, then flees. Complicating matters are
   Cetagandan and Barrayaran assassination squads (targeting Naismith and
   the clone, respectively), a Dendarii contingent and the local police,
   all converging on their location. Miles, with his usual tactical
   wizardry, is able to get himself, his clone, Vorpatril and Galeni
   safely away. As an added bonus, Miles arranges for the Cetagandans see
   him and his clone together, "proving" that Naismith and Vorkosigan are
   not the same person.

   By Betan law, the clone is Miles' brother, and Miles is well aware his
   Betan mother would be greatly displeased if he got rid of his
   troublesome new sibling. According to Barrayaran tradition, his brother
   would be named Mark Pierre Vorkosigan. Miles gives the psychologically
   scarred "Mark" a considerable sum of money and an invitation to claim
   his Barrayaran heritage, if he wants to--or dares--then lets him go.

   The delay in payment of the Dendarii funds is revealed to be due to one
   of Galen's agents on Tau Ceti. As Miles prepares to leave Earth, his
   mentor in the Dendarii, Ky Tung, announces his retirement to live with
   his people in Brazil, leaving Miles to run the mercenary fleet himself.
   Tung also lets slip that he knew about Miles's double identity all
   along.
