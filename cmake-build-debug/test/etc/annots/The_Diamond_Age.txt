   The protagonist in the story is Nell, a thete (or person without a
   tribe; equivalent to the lowest working class) living in the Leased
   Territories, a lowland slum built on the artificial, diamondoid island
   of New Chusan, located offshore from the mouth of the Yangtze River,
   northwest of Shanghai. When she is four, Nell's older brother Harv
   gives her a stolen copy of a highly sophisticated interactive book,
   Young Lady's Illustrated Primer: a Propaedeutic Enchiridion, in which
   is told the tale of Princess Nell and her various friends, kin,
   associates, etc., commissioned by the wealthy Neo-Victorian "Equity
   Lord" Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw for his granddaughter,
   Elizabeth. The story follows Nell's development under the tutelage of
   the Primer, and to a lesser degree, the lives of Elizabeth
   Finkle-McGraw and Fiona Hackworth, Neo-Victorian girls who receive
   other copies. The Primer is intended to steer its reader intellectually
   toward a more interesting life, as defined by Lord Finkle-McGraw, and
   growing up to be an effective member of society. The most important
   quality to achieving an interesting life is deemed to be a subversive
   attitude towards the status quo. The Primer is designed to react to its
   owner's environment and teach them what they need to know to survive
   and develop.

   The Diamond Age is characterized by two intersecting, almost
   equally-developed story lines: the social downfall of the nanotech
   engineer designer of the Primer, John Percival Hackworth, who makes an
   illegal copy of the Primer for his own young daughter, Fiona, and
   Nell's education through her independent work with the Primer after her
   brother Harv steals it from Hackworth. Hackworth's crime becomes known
   to Lord Finkle-McGraw and Dr. X, the black market engineer whose
   compiler Hackworth used to create the copy of the Primer, and each man
   attempts to exploit Hackworth to advance their opposing goals. A third
   storyline follows actress ("ractor") Miranda Redpath, who voices most
   of the Primer characters who interact with Nell and essentially becomes
   Nell's surrogate mother. Later Miranda's storyline is taken over by her
   boss, Carl Hollywood, after Miranda disappears in her quest to find
   Nell.

   Diamond Age also includes fully narrated educational tales from the
   Primer that map Nell's individual experience (e.g. her four toy
   friends) onto archetypal folk tales stored in the primer's database.
   Although The Diamond Age explores the role of technology and personal
   relationships in child development, its deeper and darker themes also
   probe the relative values of cultures (which Stephenson explores in his
   other novels as well) and the shortcomings in communication between
   them.
