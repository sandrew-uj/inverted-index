   The Gates are passageways through space and time that can, if misused,
   destroy entire civilizations. Such cataclysms had happened in the past,
   most recently to the qhal, a species that at one time had enslaved
   other races, including humans. The Union Science Bureau had dispatched
   a hundred men and women on a one-way mission to destroy the Gates,
   closing them behind them as they traveled from one world to the next.
   Morgaine is the last survivor of that band.

   In Vanye's world, they had been opposed by an evil ancient being whose
   knowledge of the Gates rivals Morgaine's own. The creature had taken
   over the body of Chya Roh, Vanye's cousin, then fled through the Gate
   of Ivrel to the land of Shiuan. There, he had amassed an army by
   promising men and half-breed qhal a way out of their dying world. It
   had taken all of Morgaine's guile to force a passage for her and Vanye
   through the Gate of Shiuan into a third world, but they were powerless
   to stop Roh from following with his forces.

   Being two against a hundred thousand, they are forced to flee into the
   forests of Azeroth, finding shelter with friendly villagers.
   Eventually, the natives call on their qhal lord for guidance. Morgaine
   meets with Merir, lord of Shathan, and receives grudging permission to
   travel where she wills.

   The invading army came through the Master Gate. Morgaine heads to
   Nehmin, where the Gate's controls are located, but on the way, they are
   attacked. She is seriously wounded, but manages to flee. Vanye is
   captured by humans led by Fwar, who has a grudge against him. Before he
   can be tortured overmuch, Vanye is seized by the khal, who resent Roh's
   power over them. They want any information of the Gates that the
   prisoner may have. However, Roh is informed and rescues his cousin.

   Vanye finds the camp deeply divided: Fwar's barrowlanders resented by
   the more numerous marsh people, both groups hating and despised by the
   khal, nominally led by Hetharu, but themselves split into factions. Roh
   barely maintains control over the rabble because of his knowledge of
   the Gates, or Fires as they are called in this world. Knowing the
   situation to be unstable, Roh tries to leave quietly with Vanye and
   Fwar's band, but the khal are alerted and pursue. It is a close race,
   but some of them reach the shelter of the forest, where the few
   barrowlanders not caught and killed by the khal are dispatched by Roh
   and Vanye.

   Vanye guides Roh to Merir, but the lord of Shathan has no news of
   Morgaine. Merir decides that they must go to Nehmin for answers. There,
   Vanye finds Morgaine, recovered from her near-fatal wounds. The
   guardians of Nehmin have ignored her counsel, distrusting her motives,
   and now they are under siege. At last, Morgaine forces them to
   recognize not just the immediate danger, but the ever-present
   temptation of the power of the Gates; they agree to close them after
   she and Vanye depart, even though they are their main defense against
   the horde.

   Before she leaves, Morgaine offers her assistance against their common
   enemy. In the desperate fighting, Hetharu and Shien, his main khal
   rival, are killed. With Fwar already dead, the enemy is left
   leaderless; the various factions unexpectedly turn on each other,
   ending the threat.

   There remains only Roh to trouble Morgaine. Even though the Gates will
   be shut down, he has the knowledge to reactivate them. Vanye has
   discovered first-hand that the Roh he knew and admired had not been
   killed when his body was taken over. Gradually, that Roh has regained
   control, or so Vanye believes. Morgaine is not entirely convinced, but
   allows Roh to remain alive (though under watch) when she and Vanye
   enter the Fires and leave Azeroth forever.

   In the epilogue, Roh's bow is laid to rest by inhabitants of Azeroth
   (including a now-adult child Vanye shared a connection with during his
   time there). This reveals that Roh remained in control of his body
   until his death and that Morgaine's act of mercy was not misplaced.
