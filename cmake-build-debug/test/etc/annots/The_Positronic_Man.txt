   In the twenty-first century the creation of the positronic brain leads
   to the development of robot laborers and revolutionizes life on Earth.
   Yet to the Martin family, their household robot NDR-113 is more than a
   mechanical servant. "Andrew" has become a trusted friend, a confidant,
   and a member of the Martin family.

   The story is told from the perspective of Andrew (later known as Andrew
   Martin), an NDR-series robot owned by the Martin family, a departure
   from the usual practice by U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men of leasing
   robots.

   Andrew's initial experiences with the Martin family are replete with
   awkward moments which demonstrate his lack of socialization. However,
   he is much better with inanimate objects and animals and begins to
   display sentient characteristics (such as creativity; emotion;
   self-awareness) traditionally the province of humans. He is taken off
   his mundane household duties, for which he was intended, and allowed to
   pursue his creativity, making a fortune by selling his creations.

   Andrew seeks legal protection stemming from his initial creative output
   and eventual full recognition as a human, by gradually replacing his
   robotic components with synthetic organs, and citing the process as a
   transformation from robot to human. Succeeding generations of the
   Martin family assist him in his quest for humanity, but each is limited
   to what degree they are prepared to acknowledge Andrew's humanity.

   In The Positronic Man, the trends of fictional robotics in Asimov's
   Robot series (as outlined in the book I, Robot) are detailed as
   background events, with an indication that they are influenced by
   Andrew's story. No more robots in Andrew's line are developed. There is
   also a movement towards centralized processing, including centralized
   control of robots, which would avoid any more self-reflecting robots
   such as Andrew.

   Only when Andrew allows his positronic brain to "decay", thereby
   willfully abandoning his immortality, is he declared a human being.
   This event takes place on the two-hundredth anniversary of his
   creation, hence the title of the novella and film.
