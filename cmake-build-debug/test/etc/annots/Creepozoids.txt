   Set in 1998, six years after an apocalyptic nuclear war, a group of
   five U.S. Army deserters take refuge from acid rain in a seemingly
   abandoned laboratory complex in the ruins of Los Angeles. They soon
   discover that the lab was a top-secret government research center,
   where a hideous (if rather fickle) genetically-engineered monster still
   lurks.
