   In the town of Sheffield, Ruth Beckett and Jimmy Kemp plan to marry
   after learning of Ruth's unplanned pregnancy. The plot serves as a
   distraction to the viewer against the backdrop of a gradually
   escalating confrontation in Iran where a Soviet-backed coup has
   occurred. The United States mobilizes its own forces and occupies the
   southern part of the country, and increases its naval presence in the
   Persian Gulf. The U.S. also deploys B-52 Stratofortress bombers to
   Turkey when it learns the Soviet Union has moved nuclear warheads into
   Mashad.

   The British reinforce NATO in Western Europe, following news of a
   Warsaw Pact build up in Eastern Germany. The President attempts to
   resolve the situation in Iran peacefully by proposing a joint
   withdrawal to the Soviet leader. The Soviets however ignore the
   American ultimatum, resulting in the conventional attack by U.S.
   bombers over the Soviet base at Mashad. The Soviets respond with a
   nuclear-tipped air defense missile, which is responded with the
   detonation of an American battlefield nuclear weapon over Mashad.

   News of the breakout of hostilities between the US and Soviet forces
   spurs Britain into panic buying and looting. The government enacts the
   Emergency Powers Act, and local authorities are granted powers to
   suspend peacetime function and to confiscate property and material for
   civil defense purposes. Travel is restricted for essential services
   only, the government having taken control of British Airways and
   cross-Channel ferries to assist with transporting troops to Europe.

   At 8:30am in Britain (which, the narrator notes would be 3:30am in
   Washington; implying that Western response would be at it's slowest as
   the President and the senior staff would be asleep), Attack Warning Red
   is transmitted. Minutes later, a nuclear detonation occurs over the
   North Sea which generates an electromagnetic pulse, causing major
   damage to communications across Britain and northwestern Europe. A
   secondary attack then impacts NATO military targets including RAF
   Finningley, 17 miles from Sheffield. The detonation and mushroom cloud
   is seen from Sheffield which plunges into chaos. A third and final
   attack targets primary economic targets such as the Tinsley Viaduct.
   The detonation causes massive structural damage to Sheffield, and an
   estimated 12 to 30 million people in the UK are instantly killed in the
   wider exchange.

   An hour following the attack, prevailing winds have sent fallout from a
   ground burst at Crewe over Sheffield. Communications between local
   authorities are shown to be established but limited due to disruption.
   Fires are left to burn uncontrollably, as the danger of fallout is too
   high. A month later soldiers make their way into what remains of the
   Sheffield Town Hall where the local authorities were headquartered; who
   have long suffocated to death. A year following, sunlight returns but
   with a higher ultraviolet index due to damage to the ozone layer, which
   in turn increases the likelihood of cataracts and cancer. Crop
   cultivation is poor due to the lack of fertilizers and equipment.
   Capital punishment is authorized by the Government, whose attempts to
   maintain order are largely ignored by the surviving British public.
   Since money serves no value, food takes place as the only form of
   currency; awarded for labor and withheld as punishment. The narrator
   states the cruel irony in that for the more people who die, the more
   food there is to go around. Several people including Ruth flee to the
   Buxton countryside, where she gives birth to her daughter.

   Ten years later, what remains of Britain's surviving population has
   dropped to a medieval level of 4 to 11 million people. Survivors work
   in cultivating crops, and children born after the war speak a broken
   form of English. Ruth dies in bed, survived by her 10-year-old daughter
   Jane. Industry begins to return with limited electricity and
   steam-powered technology, but the population continues to live in
   barbaric squalor. Three years after Ruth's death, Jane and two boys are
   caught stealing food. One of the boys is killed, and Jane and the other
   boy engage in a struggle for the food that degenerates into "crude
   intercourse". Months later, Jane gives birth in a makeshift
   hospital, and the film ends on a silent freeze frame as she screams at
   the sight of her deformed, stillborn baby.
