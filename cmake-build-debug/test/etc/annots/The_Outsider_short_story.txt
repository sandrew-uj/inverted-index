   "The Outsider" is written in a first-person narrative style, and
   details the miserable and apparently lonely life of an individual, who
   appears to have never made contact with another individual. The story
   begins, with the narrator explaining his origins. His memory of others
   is vague, and he cannot seem to recall any details of his personal
   history, including who he is or where he is originally from. The
   narrator tells of his environment: a dark, decaying castle amid an
   "endless forest" of high trees that block out the light from the sun.
   He has never seen natural light, nor another human being, and he has
   never ventured from the prison-like home he now inhabits. The only
   knowledge the narrator has of the outside world, is from his reading of
   the "antique books" that line the walls of his castle.

   The narrator tells of his eventual determination to free himself, from
   what he views as an existence within a prison. He decides to climb the
   ruined staircase of the high castle tower which seems to be his only
   hope for an escape. At the place where the stairs terminate into
   crumbled ruins, the narrator begins a long, slow climb up the tower
   wall, until he eventually finds a trapdoor in the ceiling, which he
   pushes up and climbs through. Amazingly, he finds himself not at the
   great height he anticipated, but at ground level in another world. With
   the sight of the full moon before him, he proclaims, "There came to me
   the purest ecstasy I have ever known." Overcome with the emotion he
   feels in beholding what--until now--he had only read about, the
   narrator takes in his new surroundings. He realizes that he is in an
   old churchyard, and he wanders out into the countryside before
   eventually coming upon another castle.

   Upon visiting the castle, which he finds "maddeningly familiar", the
   narrator sees a gathering of people at a party within. Longing for some
   type of human contact, he climbs through a window into the room. Upon
   his entering, the people inside become terrified. They scream and
   collectively flee from the room, many stumbling blindly with their
   hands held over their eyes toward the walls in search of an exit. As
   the narrator stands alone in the room, with the screams of the party
   vanishing into far away echoes, he becomes frightened at what must be
   lurking near him. He walks around the room searching for what might be
   hidden in the shadows but finds nothing. As he moves towards one of the
   room's alcoves, he detects a presence and approaches it slowly.

     I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all
     that is unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable. It
     was the ghoulish shade of decay, antiquity, and dissolution; the
     putrid dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation, the awful baring
     of that which the merciful earth should always hide. God knows it
     was not of this world--or no longer of this world--yet to my horror
     I saw in its eaten-away and bone-revealing outlines a leering,
     abhorrent travesty of the human shape; and in its mouldy,
     disintegrating apparel an unspeakable quality that chilled me even
     more.

   In his shock and surprise, he loses his balance and touches the
   creature. Horrified, he runs from the building back to his castle,
   where he tries unsuccessfully to crawl back through the grate into his
   old world. Cast out of his old existence, the narrator now rides with
   the "mocking and friendly ghouls on the night wind", forever and
   officially an outsider, since the moment he stretched his fingers
   towards the creature's paw in the alcove, and felt nothing but the
   "cold and unyielding surface of polished glass" of a mirror.
