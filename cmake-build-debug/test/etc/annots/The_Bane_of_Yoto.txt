   A gentle race known as the Numah have been enslaved by the fierce
   Olokun to mine the moon, Neos, in order to build a protective shield,
   called the Aegis, to protect both races from the disembodied
   Arbitrators - ancient gods who evolved beyond the physical realm.

   Deep in the mines of Neos, a mythical dagger is unearthed. Yoto, a
   Numah miner, is accidentally stabbed in the chest with the dagger by an
   assassin who hoped to use it on Yoto's brother Eon, a rebel leading an
   uprising against the Olokun. But rather than perish beneath the blade,
   Yoto is transformed into a giant creature who the Arbitrators hope to
   possess and reclaim a connection to the physical world once again.^[14]
