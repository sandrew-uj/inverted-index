   Bero, a minor thief, attempts to steal jade from a No Peak Fist while
   he is dining in a clan-affiliated restaurant, but Bero and his Abukei
   accomplice Sampa are quickly caught and brought to Hilo for punishment.
   After they are beaten, a remark by Sampa about a recent murder in clan
   territory leads Hilo to take the two boys to be questioned in the
   presence of his brother Lan, the clan Pillar.

   Hilo attempts to convince Lan that the Mountain clan is squeezing No
   Peak territory, but he is opposed by Doru the Weather Man, who suggests
   it is a misunderstanding and counsels a peaceful solution. Feeling
   frustrated and unsupported by Doru, Lan asks his grandfather for
   permission to replace him as Weather Man, but Kaul Sen refuses to allow
   it. A short time after this, Shae returns to Kekon, looking for a job
   that will not require her to wear jade.

   The Mountain comes close to violating aisho by kidnapping Anden, who is
   still in his final year at the Academy. Ayt Mada offers Anden a
   position in her clan, signalling that she wishes to unite the Mountain
   and No Peak. Her purpose is partially to send a message that she
   considers Hilo an unsuitable Horn.

   Once Anden has been returned safely, Lan begins to move against the
   Mountain. He proposes a new law preventing any one clan from gaining
   control of the Kekon Jade Alliance, and he sends Shae to audit the
   KJA's accounts, looking for irregularities.

   Their message to Anden having been disregarded, the Mountain makes an
   attempt on Hilo's life. In retaliation, No Peak threatens to storm
   their training complex. To prevent this, the Mountain apologizes, gives
   up the would-be assassins and makes a territorial concession. The more
   senior of the assassins offers Lan a clean blade, demanding to be
   killed in combat. Believing that he needs to prove himself to the clan
   in order to remain Pillar, Lan accepts and wins the duel, but only
   barely.

   In the aftermath, Hilo asks his brother for permission to marry his
   girlfriend Wen, and Lan, despite misgivings about his brother marrying
   a stone-eye from a disreputable family, gives his permission.

   Lan has been injured in the duel and his jade tolerance has been
   affected, but he cannot be seen to show weakness by failing to wear the
   additional jade he has won. He arranges for Anden to bring him packages
   of shine. When Anden realizes what he is delivering he pleads with Lan
   to stop using the drug, but Lan swears him to secrecy. When Shae comes
   to see Anden he tries to tell her about the shine, but misses his
   opportunity.

   Shae reports to Lan that someone in the KJA is skimming jade, and that
   either Doru doesn't know about it and is incompetent, or he is allowing
   it to happen. Lan sends Doru overseas to get him out of the way and
   tells his allies on the Royal Council that he is going to suspend jade
   production. Lan receives a letter from his estranged wife, but can't
   bring himself to open it.

   Meanwhile Bero has been stealing shipments from the Docks. Through his
   fence he meets a mysterious Mountain Green Bone, who gives Bero a
   submachine gun and tells him to use it to shoot up the gentleman's club
   Lan frequents. Lan accidentally takes an overdose of shine while
   visiting the club, and when Bero attacks him he falls into the sea and
   drowns.

   When Shae hears about his death she immediately goes to the bank where
   her jade is kept and puts it all back on. Hilo is now Pillar and she
   persuades him to strike back by reclaiming some disputed territory
   rather than launching an all-out attack on the Mountain. She takes part
   in the battle, fighting several Mountain Green Bones and killing two.
   Afterward, Hilo asks her to become his Weather Man and she agrees. She
   cements her position by gaining the support of her main rivals for the
   role, and she spares Doru's life on condition that he gives up his
   jade, renounces clan business and spends his remaining days as a
   companion for her grandfather.

   The clans are now in a state of open war. Shae and Hilo attend
   negotiations with Ayt Mada and her Weather Man until Hilo accuses the
   Mountain of skimming jade from the KJA and supplying it to non-Green
   Bones, then storms out. Ayt arranges to meet Shae on safe ground and
   tries to talk her into betraying No Peak, but Shae refuses, knowing
   that she is putting her life in serious jeopardy by doing so. She tells
   Hilo that No Peak can only hold out for another six months.

   Wen asks Shae to make her a spy for the clan, without Hilo's knowledge.
   Shae sends her to a foreign military base with a shipment of jade worth
   millions, re-establishing the supply that has been disrupted by the
   KJA's suspension of jade production.

   Kaul Sen gives his jade to Doru, and Doru uses it to attack his guards
   and escape, defecting to the Mountain with all his knowledge of No
   Peak's business dealings. The Mountain continues to use its superior
   position to maim and kill No Peak Green Bones. On New Year's Day, Hilo
   marries Wen, then has Anden drive him into Mountain territory to be
   killed in combat, in return for clemency for the remaining No Peak clan
   members. Hilo kills several Green Bones but is overwhelmed. When Gont
   Asch steps in to finish him, Hilo and Anden together kill the Horn of
   the Mountain.

   The fight leaves Anden in a coma. When he regains consciousness, he
   learns that the loss of its Horn has dealt the Mountain a serious blow
   and given No Peak a temporary advantage in the war. Anden returns to
   the Academy for his graduation ceremony, but when he is presented with
   his jade he declares he does not want to be a Green Bone. He tells Hilo
   he does not want a life of violence, and when the Pillar rebukes him
   Anden runs from the Academy to Lan's grave.

   Later, under cover of darkness, Bero also visits the grave. He is still
   looking for jade, and in the former Pillar's coffin there is a generous
   supply.
