   The book begins with a brief history of the Lands of Vin. It is
   narrated by a Washer, or preacher, of the Collegium, the main religious
   body. Nearly fifteen hundred years before the events that take place in
   Flesh and Fire, the Lands of Vin were ruled by arrogant prince-mages,
   who derived their power from spellwine. To put an end to the
   prince-mages' tyranny, Zatim, a demigod more commonly referred to as
   "Sin Washer", drastically reduced the magic contained in the
   spellgrapes used to make spellwine.

   The prelude of the book describes a mutant grub infestation Master
   Vinart Sionio of Iaja discovers in his vineyards. The mutation is
   caused by magic, and could only have been created by another Vineart.
   The plot then comes to Jerzy, an adolescent slave owned by Master
   Vineart Malech of The Berengia. When Jerzy in entranced by the smell of
   crushed grapes during the harvest, Malech takes interest in Jerzy.
   Malech then tests Jerzy's ability to sense magic, and begins training
   Jerzy to become a Vineart.

   During this time, the first of a series of strange events occur. First,
   an unusually large order of healwines is placed by the island kingdom
   of Atakus. Meanwhile, in Atakus, Prince Erebuh has just received a
   negotiator from a Vineart on the nearby island of Ekai concerning the
   loss of three ships carrying spellwine. This is highly unusual, as
   Atakus, a key port for ships, makes extensive use of spellwines to
   ensure fair weather. After Prince Erebuh gives the negotiator his
   reply, the prince's most trusted daughter, Thais, visits the
   negotiator, who kills her then commits suicide. Upon further
   investigation by Atakus's Master Vineart, Edon, it is discovered that
   the negotiator's actions were not his own, but under the influence of
   spellwine.

   Malech continues teaching Jerzy the process in crafting spellwines. A
   few months into Jerzy's training, Malech's primary field becomes
   infested with rootglow, though it is out of season for the disease. The
   infestation is contained, but does significant damage to Malech's
   vines. Then a wagon sent to collect healwines for a nearby town is
   destroyed, with no apparent cause. Malech begins to send inquiries to
   other Vineart, and discovers they have also been seeing an unusual
   number of accidents.

   In Aktakus, Prince Erebuh decides to completely isolate the island in a
   veil of fog, at the suggestion of Master Vineart Edon.

   Cooper Shen, a member of the Cooperage Guild then brings Malech news of
   sea serpents sighted near Atakus, the first sighting in over seven
   generations. Two weeks later, a messenger from Prince Ranulf arrives,
   and tells Malech that a sea serpent has destroyed the entire town of
   Darcen. The messenger also brings a request for spellwines to cleanse
   the area contaminated by the sea serpent, and Malech sends Jerzy with
   the messenger to determine which spellwine will be necessary. When
   Jerzy reaches Prince Ranulf's encampment, the sea serpent resurfaces,
   but is quickly killed by spells which Prince Ranulf and Jerzy cast.
   Jerzy returns with pieces of the serpent, and Malech determines that it
   was created using magic.

   Malech then sends Jerzy to study with Vineart Giordan of Aleppan, while
   secretly instructing Jerzy to find how much of the recent events has
   taken public interest. Giordan's dependence on the maiar of Aleppan is
   already under criticism from the Collegium, and when news of the
   exchange reaches Washers in Upper Altenne, they send Brother Darian to
   learn more about Jerzy.

   Jerzy arrives in Aleppan by boat, and begins his training with Giordan.
   Ao, a trader with the Eastern Wind Trading Clan, notices Jerzy's
   attempts to eavesdrop on the conversations of nobles, and offers to
   teach Jerzy how to be less conspicuous. Near Atakus, a Caulic ship
   attempts to locate the island, and determine the cause of its
   disappearance. The Caulic fleet also intends to capture Atakus's
   valuable ports.

   Jerzy also comes in contact with the maiar's daughter, Mahault, who
   shares how her father has not been acting normally in the past year.
   The sentiment is echoed by others who Jerzy meets with access to the
   court. After Ao and Mahault take interest in Jerzy's attempts to
   collect information, Jerzy solicits Ao's help in finding useful gossip.

   When Jerzy secretly tastes Giordan's grapes to determine if they were
   used to create the sea serpent, he is spotted by Brother Darian. Darian
   accuses Jerzy of break the Command, and apostasy, a crime punishable by
   death. During the trial, Giordan attempts to defer all blame to Jerzy,
   but the maiar and Darian are intent on finding Giordan guilty. Giordan
   panics, and attacks the guards. Mahault and Ao use the commotion to
   free Jerzy and the city.
