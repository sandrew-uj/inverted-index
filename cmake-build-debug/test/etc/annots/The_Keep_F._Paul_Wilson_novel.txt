   German soldiers and SS Einsatzkommandos are being slowly killed off in
   a mysterious castle (the "keep" of the title) high in the Carpathian
   Mountains of Romania in April 1941. Theodore Cuza, a Jewish history
   professor living in Bucharest, and his daughter Magda are brought to
   the keep by SS Sturmbannfuhrer Eric Kaempffer in a desperate attempt to
   determine what is murdering his men. Cuza is later tasked with
   defeating the unknown evil that is wreaking havoc. The professor
   translates a mysterious message written in blood on a wall that uses a
   forgotten dialect of Old Romanian or Old Slavonic.

   The entity responsible for the deaths calls itself "Molasar," and it
   finds Professor Cuza useful. Molasar procures his services through
   deception and false promises, and even puts the scleroderma from which
   he suffers into remission so he could work for him. Molasar is later
   revealed to be Rasalom, an ancient sorcerer from the "First Age" of
   humans.

   An immortal man calling himself Glenn, whose real name is Glaeken, is a
   reluctant champion of the ancient Forces of Light. He becomes aware of
   Rasalom's activity from across the world and travels to the keep. He
   built the keep as a prison for Rasalom, out of the reluctance to kill
   him outright. The two beings are mystically linked in a way that binds
   their destinies together, even though Rasalom's growing mystical powers
   are vastly greater than Glenn's own. To keep him from ever forgetting
   his mission, the Forces of Light had taken away his reflection.

   Magda and Glenn meet and develop a romantic relationship. Professor
   Cuza manipulates the Germans into arresting Glenn and bringing him into
   the keep, where he will be vulnerable to Rasalom. Inside the keep, the
   German soldiers riddle Glenn's body with bullets. Magda brings Glenn
   his mystical sword, the source of his power, which enables him to heal
   his mortal wounds. Rasalom instructs Professor Cuza to remove the
   talisman that imprisons him and bury it outside the keep.

   Magda leaves Glenn to recuperate, and tries to convince her misguided
   father not to cross the perimeter of the fortress. Glenn arrives and
   joins the talisman to his sword, enabling him to drive Rasalom back
   into the depths of the keep. Rasalom then uses his telekinetic
   abilities to launch an overwhelming assault against Glenn. Rasalom
   rashly launches himself bodily at his age-old enemy and is reduced to
   ashes by a single stroke from Glenn's sword. Glenn plummets onto the
   craggy rocks below. He awakens to discover that he is now mortal,
   having vanquished his long-time foe, and he and Magda reunite.
