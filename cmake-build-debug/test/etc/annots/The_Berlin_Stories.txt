     I am a camera with its shutter open.

   -- Christopher Isherwood

   The two novellas are set in Berlin between 1930 and 1933, just as Adolf
   Hitler was moving into power. Berlin is portrayed by Isherwood during
   this transition period of cafes and quaint avenues, grotesque nightlife
   and dreamers, and powerful mobs and millionaires.

   The Berlin Stories was the inspiration for the John Van Druten play I
   Am a Camera, which in turn went on to inspire the film I Am a Camera as
   well as the stage musical and film version of Cabaret.

   Sally Bowles is probably the best-known character from The Berlin
   Stories because she was the focus of the Cabaret musical and film,
   although in The Berlin Stories she is only the main character of one
   short story in Goodbye to Berlin.
