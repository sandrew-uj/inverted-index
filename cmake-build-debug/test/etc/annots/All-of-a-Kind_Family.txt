   All-of-a-Kind Family is based on Sydney Taylor's recollections of her
   childhood on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where her family settled
   along with many other Jewish families after migrating from Eastern
   Europe by way of Germany. The main characters are named for
   Taylor's real-life sisters, Ella, Henny, Charlotte, and Gertrude, and
   the middle sister was given the author's birth name, Sarah.

   The book's genesis was stories of her childhood that Taylor would tell
   her daughter, Jo. Taylor wrote:

     "I took my daughter Jo down to the old neighborhood where Papa, Mama
     and the five little girls had lived. But the past was dead there; it
     lived only in me. I decided to write it all down for Jo. Perhaps in
     this way I could re-create for both of us some feeling of that other
     life."

   While Taylor wrote All-of-a-Kind Family for her daughter, by some
   accounts she had no plans to publish the story. But, the story
   goes, her husband secretly submitted the manuscript for the Charles W.
   Follett Award in 1951, and it won, launching Taylor's career and what
   would become a five-book series.

   The book is noteworthy for its depiction of a joint Jewish American
   identity, with the characters expressing both pride in their Jewish
   traditions and American patriotism, following the trajectory of
   Taylor's own family's assimilation. "Not only are Jewish customs
   explained honestly and frankly, but Taylor makes them attractive and
   positive, drawing in her readers, both Jewish and non-Jewish," the
   scholar June Cummins writes.
