   The narrator Joshua--at first appearing to be just over 60 years old,
   wakes up May 27, 2109 in an apartment on human-settled Mars. With no
   memory of his past, he goes to his werp, a voice-activated laptop
   computer, and learns that his name is Joshua Ali Quare and that he was
   born in 1968. From this frame story and a box containing several
   objects from his past, Quare pieces together what he believes is true
   about his life leading to the early 22nd century. It is soon clear that
   he is unburdened by any form of morality.

   Joshua ran away from home early in his teens to escape his abusive
   father, and stayed in an upstairs apartment at Gwenny's Diner. Joshua's
   mother, a Communist party member, surreptitiously helped him. He
   entered the US Army at the behest of some Party organizers, and he was
   put in contact with a KGB operative who provided him with an injection
   to keep him from receiving or transmitting AIDS (which mutates and
   spreads soon after, wiping out a large percentage of the population of
   Earth). The injection also enhanced his memory, and periodically
   regenerates his body, so that he becomes 10 years younger with each
   15-year life period. This makes him a longtimer, and gives him the
   side-effect of having his memory wiped after every life period.

   Joshua's US Army career is spent in Operation Desert Storm (the First
   Oil War in the novel) and the "Second Oil War" which culminated in a
   march on Tehran. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the KGB
   diversified and became "the Organization," a counter-insurgency group
   that supplied technical and logistic support to every side in the
   Eurowar, a NATO-Central European Union-Russian conflict in the early
   21st century. Among the innovations of the Eurowar were Simulation
   Modeling Optimizing Targeters (SMOTs) a jump from smart weapons to
   "brilliant weapons" that attacked an enemy country's natural resources
   and means of production. These weapons cause massive environmental
   damage to the earth, and are the predecessors of the memes. Joshua, as
   an agent for The Organization, begins his violent operative career with
   a gang rape involving US soldiers, and then sets out a series of
   terrorist-like missions to intensify the war. During the Eurowar,
   Joshua raped a woman and killed her and her family (perhaps the only
   disturbing memory he regrets), murdered many soldiers and civilians,
   suppressed science and research through rape and torture, and
   essentially caused mayhem along with other Organization longtimers, for
   great sums of pay. After the Eurowar ended, Joshua took in "Alice", a
   war orphan from Prague in an incident where he got the dog tag - and
   inspiration for future alias - "John Childs".

   In the 2010s, the Organization abandoned Joshua, who then joined the
   Reconstruction after the Eurowar and worked in Quito, Ecuador on the
   GeoSync Cable and saw with Alice the beginning of the development of
   memes that would unify all countries and religions, leading to the War
   of the Memes (referred to in some of Barnes' other books) that
   culminated in the takeover of Earth by One True. Alice runs away, and
   the Organization finds and rehires Joshua to fight in the War of the
   Memes, for One True. By the time One True consolidated its hold on the
   people of Earth, Mars, the Jupiter and Saturn systems had been
   colonized for decades. Joshua steals another person's ID and becomes an
   ecoprospector on Mars.

   The best scientists and engineers of free humanity had developed the
   technology to unleash a singularity at the edge of the solar system
   that would provide a return point in time and space for the descendants
   of five transfer ships sent to colonize other nearby star systems. When
   Joshua finally ventures forth to meet his Organization contact in Red
   Sands City, he's confronted by a tremendous hustle and bustle of people
   preparing for the transfer ship descendants to arrive from the 25th
   century and either destroy One True (and the population on Earth under
   its control) or confine it there.

   A fellow Organization agent named Sadi has been in Joshua's life one
   way or another since the inception of the Organization. On Mars, Sadi,
   who's also a longtimer, meets Joshua as a woman, Sadi's original
   gender, and now gender of choice. This is possible due to the
   Organization perfecting the regeneration process, now called 'revival',
   which also gave Sadi complete memory recovery and a permanent
   20-year-old body. From Sadi, whom Joshua had met as a woman after the
   Eurowar and was partnered with when Sadi was male during the War of the
   Memes, Joshua learns that it's possible to go through the singularity
   to 1988, when the technology to construct it was first built and put
   into orbit by the Soviets. By the time of the novel's frame story, Sadi
   has done this thirty times, each time changing history to his/her
   benefit. After Joshua's revival and a time as Sadi's lover, Joshua,
   who's repeatedly refused to accompany Sadi on these excursions through
   the singularity, (also known as a closed timelike curve), is sent by
   her via force on a preset course through the singularity once more.
   Sadi claims to have brought Joshua back in time with her before,
   without being revived, so she could 'help' Joshua love her as
   obsessively as Sadi loves him. Now she wants him to experience the
   freedom she's had, in hopes of having him come back to her for good.
   Joshua makes plans when he comes back to the late 20th century to
   change history himself, many times over, alone.
