   The setting is an Earth outpost beyond our solar system that has been
   cut off from the rest of humanity for centuries. Government propaganda
   actor Tertulius Justus uses his false reputation as a war hero to avoid
   execution at the hands of the military state after he's been fired from
   his job. With nowhere else to hide, he sets off for the lawless,
   Post-apocalyptic expanse beyond the safety of the state's
   walls.
