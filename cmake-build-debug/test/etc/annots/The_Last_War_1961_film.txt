   The film begins with a narration over shots of a modern-day Tokyo,
   noting that 16 years have passed since the end of World War II, and
   Japan has achieved rapid recovery. Mokichi Tamura works as a driver for
   a press center, hoping for happiness for his family. His daughter,
   Saeko, is in love with a merchant, Takano, who has been at sea for a
   long time. When he returns, the young couple agree to get married with
   the consent of Saeko's father.

   Meanwhile, tensions between the Federation and the Alliance (fictional
   stand-ins for the US/NATO and the USSR/Warsaw Pact, respectively)
   build, especially after an intelligence-gathering vessel is captured. A
   new Korean War breaks out across the 38th parallel but is quickly
   stopped. Although Japan calls on both sides to seek peace, government
   officials think that the country could be ripe for Alliance retaliation
   in light of its open support for the Federation.

   Dogfights between Federation and Alliance fighters over the Arctic
   (with both sides using nuclear-tipped air-to-air missiles) are just the
   beginning of a renewed conflict. Soon after an armistice agreement is
   concluded between North Korea and South Korea, tensions begin to erupt
   again because of the fighting between the two Koreas. The efforts of
   the military to overcome the war are fruitless. In addition, Japan's
   missile warning begins to mount in Japan, and the anxiety of the people
   reaches a peak.

   Five ICBMs are eventually launched from both sides in the climax of the
   escalating war, with targets being major cities around the world
   including Tokyo, London, Paris, New York and Moscow. The Tamura family
   stay behind in the midst of the city's panic and hold a final dinner.
   That night, Tokyo is enveloped in a flash of nuclear light and blown
   apart, with the ground being torn asunder by the explosion and
   resulting in a violent volcanic eruption that almost completely
   consumes the wreckage of the city. Tamura and his family are killed by
   the detonation over Tokyo as their house is blown away by the ensuing
   fireball. Shortly after Tokyo is destroyed, the remaining four missiles
   strike their targets, obliterating all of them. The next morning after
   Tokyo's decimation, Takano's ship changes course to arrive at the
   remains of the destroyed city, prepared to die by the intense
   radioactive fallout. The ship's chaperone and Takano break down as the
   enduring events of what has happened become realised. The last shot
   shows Tokyo, now an immense crater, with the remains of the Diet
   Building at the centre and a warning laid over the screen, asking for
   the events in this film never to happen.
