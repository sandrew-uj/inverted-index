   Judy Blume has said that the character of Margaret was inspired by her
   own experiences in sixth grade. Like Margaret, Blume did not physically
   mature at the same rate as her classmates, and tried exercises to get
   her bust to grow. Like Margaret, Blume also had "a
   very personal relationship with God". However, Blume said that
   Margaret's family life grew from Blume's imagination, as her own family
   was very different from the one portrayed in the book.
