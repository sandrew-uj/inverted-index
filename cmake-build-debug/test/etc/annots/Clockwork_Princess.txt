   Two months after the events of the previous book, Tessa Gray is in the
   midst of preparing for her wedding to Jem Carstairs. Gabriel Lightwood
   arrives at the Institute and requests help in taking care of his
   father, Benedict, whose demon pox has turned him into a worm, killing
   the Lightwood's servants and Rupert Blackthorn, the husband of his
   daughter, Tatiana. At the end, Gabriel and his brother, Gideon, have no
   choice but to kill their father, creating a rift between the brothers
   and Tatiana. Gabriel moves to the London Institute and develops a
   relationship with Will Herondale's sister, Cecily, who has also taken
   residence in the Institute after failing to convince Will to return
   home, much to Will's annoyance.

   Jem gets sick faster and Will realizes that he has taken an unusually
   higher dosage of yin fen so he can stay stronger for the wedding.
   However, Axel Mortmain has bought all of London's stock of yin fen,
   wanting to blackmail the Institute into handing over Tessa in exchange
   for the drug. Jem refuses to even consider the offer and convinces
   Tessa to do the same, so they decide to move the date of their wedding
   earlier. Meanwhile, Consul Josiah Wayland, now increasingly frustrated
   by Charlotte Branwell's refusal to be his lapdog, attempts to convince
   Gideon and Gabriel to betray her in exchange for the Lightwood's honor
   to be restored. Gideon steadfastly refuses, but Gabriel has to go
   through some time before he finally chooses to side with Charlotte.

   After undergoing trials at Silent City, Jessie Lovelace is sent back to
   the London Institute. On the day of her arrival, automatons and Mrs.
   Black attack the Institute and mortally wounds Jessie before taking
   Tessa away. Before she dies, she leaves clues for Will and Cecily about
   where Mortmain is taking Tessa to: Cadair Idris. Jem collapses from his
   illness and learns about Will's unrequited love for Tessa, before
   urging him to save her in his stead. While Will is on his way, he feels
   his parabatai bond with Jem severed and realizes that Jem is gone. Back
   at the Institute, Charlotte's attempt to rally the Enclave to support
   her fails, managing only to gather Sophie, Cecily, Gideon, Gabriel,
   Magnus Bane, and three Silent Brothers for the mission to stop
   Mortmain. Henry and Magnus create a device capable of transporting
   people through great distances, dubbed as the Portal. Meanwhile,
   Wayland gathers the Clave for an emergency meeting to depose Charlotte,
   only for the automatons to attack them and kill him and Aloysius
   Starkweather.

   On the way to Wales, Tessa briefly frees herself from Mrs. Black, now
   only a disembodied head, and discovers that her clockwork angel pendant
   holds an essence of the angel Ithuriel. Upon arrival at Cadair Idris,
   Tessa is forced to shapeshift into John Shade and teach Mortmain how to
   create automatons capable of carrying demonic spirits. He reveals that
   Tessa was born to a Greater Demon father and a Shadowhunter mother, a
   feat normally impossible since demon-nephilim children are usually born
   dead. By switching Elizabeth Gray with Adele Starkweather, Aloysius'
   granddaughter who died when she was young, "Elizabeth" became a
   Shadowhunter who was not marked, and by giving her the protection of
   Ithuriel, and the fact that Elizabeth was not marked, Tessa could be
   delivered alive. Mortmain arranged for Tessa to start a new race of
   demon-nephilim hybrids. Will reunites with Tessa and makes love with
   her as solace of Jem's fate. The two meet up with Charlotte and the
   others and begin battling through Mortmain's automatons, learning to
   their shock that one of the Silent Brothers, [Brother Zachariah], is
   Jem. Henry is gravely wounded and left paraplegic, even after Magnus
   successfully saved him. As Tessa is about to be captured by Mortmain,
   she shapeshifts into Ithuriel himself and incinerates Mortmain, before
   falling unconscious for several days.

   Upon her recovery, Jem, now Brother Zachariah, visits Tessa and
   promises to meet her every year for an hour at Blackfriars Bridge
   before departing for Silent City. Charlotte is offered the job of
   Consul and plans to train Will to succeed her as head of the London
   Institute. Gideon proposes to Sophie and accompanies her as she
   undergoes Ascension to become a Shadowhunter. At the Christmas
   celebration of that year, Magnus leaves for the New World and makes
   Will promise to find his own happiness. Will takes this advice and
   proposes to Tessa, who accepts. Subsequently, Will and Cecily introduce
   Tessa and Gabriel, respectively, to their parents.

   In the years that follow, Tessa marries Will and has a son named after
   Jem. However, she does not grow old with him and has to watch as Henry
   and Gideon pass away, before Will follows them in 1937. Afterwards,
   Tessa leaves her family for good, unable to see any more of her loved
   ones dying, and becomes a wanderer, though she continues to keep in
   touch with Jem every year. In 2008, more than seventy years after Will
   died, Tessa is shocked to see that Jem is no longer a Silent Brother,
   thanks to a twist of events. Although she is wary of having to see him
   grow old again, she nevertheless wants to travel the world once more
   with him.
