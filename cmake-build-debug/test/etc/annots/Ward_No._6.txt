   Revolving around philosophical and social conflicts, this story is set
   in a provincial mental asylum and explores the interactions occurring
   between a doctor and the members of his town. Andrey Yefimitch Ragin is
   the head doctor of a small town and although his position is favorable,
   he finds himself distressed with the mediocrity surrounding him. His
   deep desire to be submerged in intellectual conversation is satisfied
   by one of the patients in the mental ward adjacent to the hospital.
   This ward consists of five patients, referred to as lunatics, and a
   behavior enforcing soldier. The doctor seldomly visited the ward, but
   the one time he did, he became captivated by a paranoid patient who
   challenged his view on suffering. Ivan Gromov, although in a mental
   ward, was one of the sane members of the town, an eloquent man capable
   of engaging in the sort of intellectual conversation that the doctor
   had long been searching for. Gromov denounces the injustice he sees
   everywhere, while Dr. Ragin insists on ignoring injustice and other
   evils; partially as a result of this way of thinking, he neglects to
   remedy the shoddy conditions of the mental ward.

   To the people of the town, it was quite flabbergasting that the doctor
   was spending an excess amount of time in the mental ward. Consequently,
   rumors were spread questioning the mental stability of Ragin, and
   whether or not he was fit to continue being the doctor of the town.
   Such was the concern of the townspeople, that they created a council to
   judge Ragin's sanity, and ultimately deemed him insane. Ragin was not
   made aware of this absurd diagnosis but rather was persuaded by a man,
   Mihail Averyanitch, to go on vacation because he was not acting like
   himself lately, and surely a vacation would rid him of his peculiar
   behavior. Despondency followed Ragin on vacation, and isolated him
   further from society. Having spent all of his money on vacation and
   loaning it to Averyanitch, Ragin returned to town and found himself
   without a job and without a penny to fall on. With no where left to
   turn, Ragin moved in to the residency where the hospital chef lived and
   found himself spiraling down the rabbit hole.

   The epitome of Ragin's destruction was marked when Averyanitch along
   with the new doctor of the town, Hobotov, visited Ragin in his new
   living headquarters. Such social displeasure provoked Ragin to spew
   vile words and even launch a bottle of bromide at the horrified
   visitors. It was at that moment that all hope was lost for Ragin, and
   Dr. Hobotov was convinced that Ragin should be admitted to the mental
   ward. Discreetly, Hobotov lured Ragin into the mental ward under the
   pretext that there was a patient with a curious lung case. Once both of
   them were in the ward, Hobotov slipped out, and left Ragin trapped
   against his will. Now faced with the same future as Gromov's, Ragin
   understood that suffering was not a creation of the mind that could be
   whisked away by changing one's mentality. No longer an esteemed doctor,
   Ragin fought with futile efforts to be released from the ward but was
   instead faced with the beatings that were customarily given to the
   other members of the ward. Ragin's enlightenment came at the cost of
   his destruction; becoming a patient of the asylum triggered an
   apoplectic stroke in Ragin that ended his life after one day in the
   ward. What once were five lunatics, became six, and marked Ward No.6.
