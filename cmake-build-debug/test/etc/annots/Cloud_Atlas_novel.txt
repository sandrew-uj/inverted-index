   The book consists of six nested stories; each is read or observed by a
   main character of the next, thus they progress in time through the
   central sixth story. The first five stories are each interrupted at a
   pivotal moment. After the sixth story, the others are resolved in
   reverse chronological order. The protagonist of each section reads or
   observes the chronologically earlier work in the chain.
