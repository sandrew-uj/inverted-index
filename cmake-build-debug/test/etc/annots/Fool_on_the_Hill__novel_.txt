   The novel is the story of two authors, the buffoonish Prof. Stephen
   Titus George and his artful adversary Mr. Sunshine. Both live in
   Ithaca, New York.

   During a particularly cold New York winter, George starts to suspect
   that he is not himself but the creation of someone else, someone he
   calls "Mr. Sunshine." Sunshine and George enter into a battle of wits
   to determine who should be called "creator." Did George create himself?
   Did Mr. Sunshine create George? What is the meaning of collaboration?

   Throughout the novel colorful characters on the campus of Cornell
   University appear. There is the mysterious Cornell student Aurora
   Borealis Smith with whom Stephen Titus George falls in love. There is
   the Norse God Ragnarok wielding his Pollaxe. There are the Bohemians, a
   dog named Luther, a cat named Blackjack, Puck, and Calliope, a
   fire-breathing paper dragon. And let's not forget evil forces like
   Rasferret the Grub, a mannequin called Rubbermaid, and an army of rats.

   And so the drama then unfolds as it tells the time-tested story of the
   battle between Good and Evil and the efforts of the two authors to
   write the story towards either a happy ending or a tragic Greek drama.
