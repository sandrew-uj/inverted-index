   Roughly two thousand years after a nuclear war has devastated
   civilization, Riddley, the young narrator, stumbles upon efforts to
   recreate a weapon of the ancient world.

   The novel's characters live a harsh life in a small area which is
   presently the English county of Kent, and know little of the world
   outside of "Inland" (England). Their level of civilization is similar
   to England's prehistoric Iron Age, although they do not produce their
   own iron but salvage it from ancient machinery. Church and state have
   combined into one secretive institution, whose mythology, based on
   misinterpreted stories of the war and an old Catholic saint (Eustace),
   is enacted in puppet shows.
