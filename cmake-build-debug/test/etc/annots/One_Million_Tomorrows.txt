   In the 22nd century, no one has to die of old age any more. The
   pharmaceuticals division of a large corporation has devised a potion
   that bestows immortality on a single application, without any need for
   follow up treatments. The immortality treatment does not and cannot
   wear off. All it takes is a single dose, and the human will become
   immortal. However, it has an unusual effect on males that drink it. It
   effectively neuters them, causing complete cessation of sexual desire
   and the ability to perform sexually. In this kind of world, many men
   put off taking the immortality treatment for as long as possible.

   However, the main character, Will Carewe, is not yet immortal, and
   wishes to involve his wife in questions as serious as this one. They
   have not yet had any children. He is a high ranking employee for a
   transnational corporation that one day approaches him with a
   confidential question relating to the discovery of an immortality
   potion that does the same thing that the current one does, but without
   the undesirable side-effect of turning off the sex drive in males. The
   desirability of patenting the process requires the corporation to
   handle related matters under a cloak of secrecy, but somewhere someone
   has spilled the beans; competitors will do anything for the magic
   recipe, especially if this can be done before the patent is filed in
   the US Patent Office. They will do anything, including bribery,
   extortion, and murder, to get the information out of the
   pharmaceuticals lab before the process is made public. The hero of the
   story, Will Carewe, says he is willing to test the new chemical, even
   if it backfires and results in permanent sterility and complete loss of
   physical desire and physical ability. But it appears there is someone
   out there who is willing to do anything to kill him before he does.
