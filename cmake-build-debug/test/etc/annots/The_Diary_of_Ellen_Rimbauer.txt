   The novel relates the building of the Rimbauer house (which is
   eventually named "Rose Red") in 1906 by John Rimbauer for his new wife,
   Ellen, as a wedding present. John Rimbauer owned an oil company, and
   used much of his wealth to build the mansion, which was in the
   Tudor-Gothic style and situated on 40 acres (160,000 m2) of woodland
   in the heart of Seattle, Washington, in the United States. The site was
   a Native American burial ground (a common motif in early works by
   author Stephen King). The house appeared cursed even as it was
   being constructed: Three construction workers were killed on the site,
   and a construction foreman was murdered by a co-worker.

   Various entries in the fictional diary also describe Ellen Rimbauer's
   naivete regarding sexual matters. In sometimes graphic language, the
   novel's "diary entries" discuss Ellen's sexual relationship with her
   physically, sexually, and emotionally abusive husband; her growing
   awareness of her lesbianism (or possible bisexuality; the novel is
   unclear); her friendship and sexual relationship with Sukeena; the
   birth of her children; and her growing dislike (even hatred) of her
   misogynistic, arrogant husband. The novel portrays Ellen Rimbauer
   as a victim of sexual repression and Victorian morality.
