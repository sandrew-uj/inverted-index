   Edward Longstretch is a normal boy who has a normal sister, a normal
   mother, and a father whose mysterious job requires the family to
   suddenly pull up stakes and move out to an odd house in the country. He
   soon discovers that nothing is really as normal as he thinks it is, the
   new house least of all. How is that he has a weird affinity for the
   place, can communicate with it, and even swim through its walls? Why
   are there strange occult books in its library, living gargoyles on its
   cornices, and cannons in its belfrey?

   Edward is barely introduced to the house's many secrets and his new
   teachers, Dr. Basileus and the partly robotic Zarcon of the planet
   Zarconax when the place comes under attack by Ghastly Horrors. Then
   sister Margaret, seeking a better internet connection, opens a window
   and accidentally lets them in. After that things start happening really
   fast, with the adults out of commission and the children in the
   clutches of the sadistic Mrs. Morgentod, and the fate of the entire
   universe in the balance.

   Unless Edward can awaken the Dragon that is the house and become the
   hero that is needed through his connection with it, the undead Skeleton
   Dragon and its sinister Avatar will corrupt and consume all he holds
   dear.
