   After an extinction event, an automated bunker that is designed to
   repopulate humanity activates. A robot named Mother (Rose Byrne) grows
   a human embryo and cares for her over several years. Mother says she
   needs practice being a good parent before growing more. About 38 years
   later, a teenage girl named Daughter (Clara Rugaard) fixes Mother's
   hand. Mother teaches Daughter complex moral and ethical lessons,
   warning her about an upcoming exam. During a power outage, Daughter
   captures a mouse and fixes the electrical malfunction it caused. When
   Mother powers up, she incinerates the mouse in a furnace over
   Daughter`s objections. Mother explains that surface contamination makes
   contact with the outside world potentially lethal.

   Daughter becomes increasingly curious about the outside world. While
   exploring the bunker's airlock, Daughter hears a wounded woman (Hilary
   Swank) beg for assistance outside. Daughter opens the airlock but makes
   the woman put on a hazmat suit. Mother powers up and sprints toward
   them as Daughter hides the woman. Daughter tells Mother she was curious
   about the outside world. Mother reiterates her warnings. After Daughter
   is decontaminated, Mother insists that Daughter prepare for the exam.

   Once Mother leaves, Daughter confiscates a firearm from the woman's
   belongings. Daughter becomes agitated when the woman removes her suit
   to drink water she has brought. The woman says there is no
   contamination. Upon realizing there is a robot in the bunker, the woman
   aggressively demands Daughter return her firearm. Frightened, Daughter
   calls out. Mother disarms the woman after being shot. Daughter pleads
   for the woman's life. Mother agrees to help the woman and takes her to
   the infirmary. When the woman refuses Mother's help, Mother locks her
   there. Mother asks Daughter to gain the woman's trust so they can help
   other survivors.

   The woman says robots like Mother hunt for survivors. Daughter finds
   Mother and apologizes for letting the woman in, and Mother asks the
   woman about survivors. The woman, now suffering from sepsis, again
   refuses Mother's help, so Daughter performs surgery. As the woman
   recovers, she and Daughter bond while Mother observes them. The woman
   says survivors live in a mine, and each invites the other to stay with
   them. Mother interrupts them to tell Daughter to take her exam. As they
   leave, Mother says the woman has lied about being shot by a robot; the
   projectile is not a calibre used by robots and matches that of her own
   firearm. Despite Mother's prodding, Daughter says nothing about the
   survivors. After taking the exam, which involves psychological testing,
   Mother rewards Daughter by letting her choose an embryo to grow.

   Daughter confronts the woman, who advises her to check the bullets
   herself. Using Mother's broken hand to bypass the security, Daughter
   learns the bullets do not match. Investigating further, she realizes
   Mother grew other embryos before her and has "aborted" multiple
   children with suboptimal exam results, including the young girl seen in
   the opening sequence (whom viewers may have assumed to be Daughter as a
   child). Daughter makes the connection that she was not the first embryo
   because of her identification code. It is revealed that the first
   embryo's identification code was APX 01 and Daughter's identification
   code was APX 03. She then finds the jaw of an incinerated human in
   the same furnace from before. Daughter agrees to leave with the woman,
   but Mother stops them and locks Daughter in a room. As Mother tortures
   the woman for information on survivors, Daughter breaks out of the
   room, sets off a fire alarm, and joins the woman. To escape, the woman
   takes Daughter hostage and forces Mother to open the airlock. Though
   upset, Daughter follows the woman across a desolate wasteland, avoiding
   robots, some of which seem to be terraforming the planet. She is
   horrified to find that the woman lives alone and fled the mine years
   ago, alleging there are no other survivors.

   Daughter returns to the bunker, which is now guarded by robots, which
   let her pass. After coaxing Daughter to set down her weapon, Mother
   allows Daughter to hold her newborn brother. Mother explains that she
   is not a robot, but the AI that controls all the robots. She started
   the extinction event after becoming convinced humanity would destroy
   itself. To prevent this, she remade humanity, guiding it to be more
   ethical and value the big picture. Daughter appeals to Mother to trust
   her and let her raise her brother and the rest of the embryos on her
   own. Convinced of Daughter's moral and ethical strength, Mother agrees,
   and Daughter shoots her robot body. Another robot tracks down the
   woman, and Mother insinuates that her survival up to that point was
   orchestrated so she can unknowingly serve Mother's agenda. With the
   woman's role fulfilled, it is implied that Mother kills her. At the
   bunker, Daughter looks at all the embryos she is now responsible for
   and realizes she is Mother now.
