   Lolly Willowes is a satirical comedy of manners incorporating elements
   of fantasy. It is the story of a middle-aged spinster who moves to a
   country village to escape her controlling relatives and takes up the
   practice of witchcraft.^[2] The novel opens at the turn of the
   twentieth century, with Laura Willowes moving from Somerset to London
   to live with her brother Henry and his family. The move comes in the
   wake of the death of Laura's father, Everard, with whom she lived at
   the family home, Lady Place. Laura's other brother, James, moves into
   Lady Place with his wife and his young son, Titus, with the intention
   to continue the family's brewing business. However, James dies suddenly
   of a heart attack and Lady Place is rented out, with the view that
   Titus, once grown up, will return to the home and run the business.

   After twenty years of being a live-in aunt Laura finds herself feeling
   increasingly stifled both by her obligations to the family and by
   living in London. When shopping for flowers on the Moscow Road, Laura
   decides she wishes to move to the Chiltern Hills and, buying a guide
   book and map to the area, she picks the village of Great Mop as her new
   home. Against the wishes of her extended family, Laura moves to Great
   Mop and finds herself entranced and overwhelmed by the chalk hills and
   beech woods. Though sometimes disturbed by strange noises at night, she
   settles in and befriends her landlady and a poultry farmer.

   After a while, Titus decides to move from his lodgings in Bloomsbury to
   Great Mop and be a writer, rather than managing the family business.
   Titus's renewed social and domestic reliance on Laura make her feel
   frustrated that even living in the Chilterns she cannot escape the
   duties expected of women. When out walking, she makes a pact with a
   force that she takes to be Satan, to be free from such duties. On
   returning to her lodgings, she discovers a kitten, whom she takes to be
   Satan's emissary, and names him Vinegar, in reference to an old picture
   of witches' familiars. Subsequently, her landlady takes her to a
   Witches' Sabbath attended by many of the villagers.

   Titus is plagued with misadventures, such as having his milk constantly
   curdle and falling into a nest of wasps. Finally, he proposes marriage
   to a London visitor, Pandora Williams, who has treated his wasp stings,
   and the two retreat to London. Laura, relieved, meets Satan at Mulgrave
   Folly and tells him that women are like 'sticks of dynamite' waiting to
   explode and that all women are witches even 'if they never do anything
   with their witchcraft, they know it's there - ready!' The novel ends
   with Laura acknowledging that her new freedom comes at the expense of
   knowing that she belongs to the 'satisfied but profound indifferent
   ownership' of Satan.
