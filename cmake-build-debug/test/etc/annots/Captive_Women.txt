   The film opens with war footage from World War III ending with a
   nuclear attack.

   Long after the nuclear war, the last human survivors are divided into
   three tribes. Robert (Clarke) and Ruth (Field) are about to be married
   in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic New York City during a brief
   interlude in ongoing hostilities between their tribe (the Norms) and
   the rival tribe (the Mutates). The Mutates try to adhere to the tenets
   of the Christian Bible, but it is rejected by the Norms.

   However, raiders from a third tribe, the Upriver People, attack through
   the Hudson River Tunnel and capture Ruth and several other women
   because they desperately need fertile females. The warring tribes must
   put aside their differences to rescue the women, a joint effort that
   unfolds quite quickly in the short film.

   Ultimately, the Upriver People are defeated and are trapped in the
   tunnel as it is flooded. The women are recovered, and there are
   improved prospects for more peaceful relations among the tribes as the
   film concludes.
