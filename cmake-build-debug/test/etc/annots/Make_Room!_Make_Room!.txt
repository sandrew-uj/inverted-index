   Make Room! Make Room! is set in an overpopulated New York City in 1999
   (33 years after the time of writing). 30-year-old Police Detective Andy
   Rusch lives in half a room, sharing it with Sol, a retired engineer who
   has adapted a bicycle to generate power for an old television set and a
   refrigerator.

   When Andy lines up for their continually reducing water ration, he
   witnesses a public speech by the "Eldsters", older people forcibly
   retired from work. A riot breaks out after a nearby food shop has a
   surprise sale on "soylent" (soy and lentil) steaks. The shop is looted
   by the mob. Billy Chung, an 18-year-old Chinese-American, grabs a box
   of steaks. He eats some of them and sells the rest to raise enough
   money to land a job as a Western Union messenger boy. His first
   delivery takes him into a fortified apartment block, complete with the
   rare luxuries of air conditioning and running water for showers. He
   delivers his message to a rich racketeer named "Big Mike" O'Brien and
   sees Shirl, Mike's 23-year-old live-in mistress. Billy leaves the
   apartment, but fixes it so he can get back into the building later. He
   breaks into Mike's place, but when Mike catches him in the act, Billy
   accidentally kills him and flees, empty-handed.

   A piece of evidence may connect an out-of-town crime boss who may be
   trying to expand into New York City, a threat to Mike's associates.
   They see to it that Andy keeps working on the case, in addition to his
   regular duties.

   During his investigation, he becomes enamored of Shirl. He ensures that
   she is permitted to stay in the apartment until the end of the month.
   During this month, they enjoy the luxuries. Afterwards Shirl moves in
   with Andy. Shirl soon becomes disappointed with how little time the
   overworked Andy has for her. She eventually sleeps with a wealthy man
   she meets at a party.

   To evade capture, Billy leaves the city, eventually breaking into the
   abandoned Brooklyn Navy Yard, where he comes to live with Peter, who is
   eagerly awaiting the new millennium as the end of the world. Soon they
   are attacked and displaced by a trio. They find a new home in a car.
   Months after the murder, Billy decides to visit his family, believing
   the police have lost interest in him.

   Meanwhile, Sol decides he can no longer remain passive in the face of
   humanity's overpopulation crisis. He joins a march to protest the
   overturning of a legislative bill that supports population control. Sol
   is injured in a riot and catches pneumonia. A few days after his death,
   an obnoxious family takes over his living quarters, making Shirl and
   Andy's life much more miserable than before.

   Andy stumbles upon Billy Chung, cornering him in his family's home.
   When Billy moves to attack Andy with a knife, he stumbles, and Andy
   accidentally shoots and kills him. The gangsters have lost interest by
   this point, but his superiors disavow Andy's actions, and he is
   temporarily demoted to ordinary patrolman. When he returns to his
   quarters, he finds Shirl has left him.

   Andy is on patrol in Times Square on New Year's Eve, where he spots
   Shirl among rich party-goers. As the clock strikes midnight, Andy
   encounters Peter, who is distraught that the world has not ended and
   asks how life can continue as it is. The story concludes with the Times
   Square screen announcing that "Census says United States had biggest
   year ever, end-of-the-century, 344 million citizens."
