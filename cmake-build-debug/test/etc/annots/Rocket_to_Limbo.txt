   On the afternoon of 2008 Mar 03 the Star Ship Argonaut lifted off Earth
   and set course on the Long Passage to Alpha Centauri. The builders
   intended that the crew establish a colony on one of Alpha Centauri's
   planets and then bring Argonaut back to Earth. The ship never returned
   and no trace of her has ever been found.

   In the year 2351 Lars Heldrigsson joins the crew of the Star Ship
   Ganymede, which is scheduled to fly to Vega III. Once the ship has
   lifted herself into space Lars and the other 21 crewmen discover that
   the ship is actually going to the planet Wolf IV to search for the lost
   Star Ship Planetfall. Such a thing is unprecedented and even more
   disturbing is the presence of fusion bombs in the ship's hold. Angry at
   being effectively shanghaied onto a dangerous mission, some of the men
   attempt to take the ship. The mutiny fails and, threatened with
   abandonment in interstellar space, the mutineers agree to continue on
   the mission.

   Wolf IV is a cold, gray planet, almost completely covered by clouds. A
   scout spots what appears to be the wreckage of the Planetfall lying on
   a mountainside and also catches a glimpse of what he takes to be a city
   in a valley beyond the mountains. The crew lands Ganymede on a river
   delta 75 miles from the wreck and landing parties go out to familiarize
   the men with the environment. At night the mutineers sabotage the
   communications equipment and return to the ship. Lars discovers the
   betrayal and he and the other men pursue the mutineers. When they get
   back to the delta they see that the ship is gone, though no one heard
   or saw it blast off.

   With no other option available to them, the men make the arduous climb
   to the wreck, hoping to find food, generators to recharge the batteries
   in their heater suits, and possibly a means of communicating with
   Earth. But the wreck is not the Planetfall: it is the Argonaut. The
   men's last, faint hope now is to find the city that the scout thought
   he saw in the next valley.

   The men trudge onward, over the pass, and down into the valley. The fog
   lifts and the men see a three-dimensional kaleidoscope, filled with
   people, floating several hundred feet above a meadow. Lars is taken
   into the city and meets up with Peter Bingham, Ganymede's other
   Officer-in-Training. Lars and Peter are treated as honored guests by
   the City-people, who possess the power of teledynamics, the ability to
   change the forms of matter and energy with a thought. Meanwhile,
   Planetfall and Ganymede are kept in storage and their crews kept in
   deep sleep.

   The City-people subject Lars and Peter to some kind of training but
   cannot explain what it is meant to accomplish. Then suddenly the men
   discover that they are being trained to develop their own teledynamic
   abilities and that the training has succeeded. The City-people, the
   descendants of the babies that aliens found in the wreck of the
   Argonaut, free the other men and allow them to take their ships back to
   Earth, with Lars and Peter as ambassadors of a new order of Reality.

   At the end of the story Lars and Peter break the deadlock in the plot
   by developing the latent psychic powers that the City-people had been
   nurturing in them. In this feature the story resembles a similar
   breaking of the story's deadlock found in The Angry Espers by Lloyd
   Biggle, Jr.,^[1] in which an Earthman stranded on a strange planet must
   develop his latent psychic abilities in order to deal with the people
   around him.
