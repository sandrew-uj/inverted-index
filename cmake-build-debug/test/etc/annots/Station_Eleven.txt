   During a production of King Lear at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto,
   Jeevan watches as the actor playing Lear, Arthur Leander, has a heart
   attack. Since he has begun training as a paramedic, Jeevan tries to
   resuscitate Arthur, but is unsuccessful. Instead, he comforts one of
   the child actors in the production, Kirsten. After leaving the play,
   Jeevan goes for a walk in the snow and receives a call from his friend,
   a doctor. He warns Jeevan to get out of the city as the mysterious
   Georgia Flu is spreading rapidly and will soon become a full-blown
   pandemic. Jeevan loads up on supplies and goes to stay with his
   paraplegic brother. Many of the actors, actresses, and others that had
   gathered to mourn Arthur's death die within the next three weeks.

   Twenty years later, Kirsten is part of a nomadic group of actors and
   musicians known as the Travelling Symphony. Kirsten, who was eight at
   the time of outbreak, can remember little of her life before Year Zero,
   but clings to a two-volume set of graphic novels given to her by Arthur
   before his death, titled Dr. Eleven. The troupe operates on a two-year
   cycle touring the Great Lakes region, performing Shakespeare plays and
   classical music, while Kirsten scavenges abandoned homes for props,
   costumes, and traces of Arthur in tabloid magazines.

   The troupe intends to reunite with two members they left behind - the
   pregnant Charlie, and her husband, Jeremy - at a small town. Upon
   arriving, they are disturbed to find that their friends are missing,
   and the town is now under the control of the Prophet, who rapes the
   young girls he claims as his "wives". The troupe quickly leaves town,
   and goes off-route to the 'Museum of Civilization', a settlement where
   they believe they might find their missing friends. However, en route,
   they discover a young stowaway who fled the town, as she was promised
   to the Prophet as his bride. Shortly after, members of the troupe begin
   to disappear until finally the entire troupe is gone, leaving only
   Kirsten and her friend August. Frightened, they continue on to the
   Museum hoping to be reunited with others.

   Unbeknownst to Kirsten, the graphic novel Dr. Eleven is an unpublished
   passion project by Arthur's first wife, Miranda. Fourteen years before
   the collapse of civilization, Miranda left an abusive relationship and
   married Arthur, a friend from her hometown in coastal British Columbia
   who has since become famous. As Arthur's fame as an actor hit its peak,
   Miranda realized he was having an affair with the woman who would
   become his second wife, Elizabeth. The night that Miranda discovers the
   affair, she walks out of her home and asks a paparazzo outside if he
   has a cigarette. The paparazzo turns out to be Jeevan. Years later,
   when Jeevan is trying to reinvent himself as an entertainment
   journalist, Arthur gives him an exclusive interview; he is leaving
   Elizabeth and their young son, Tyler, to be with another woman. Jeevan
   reflects on this while he and his brother Frank are quarantining in
   Frank's apartment. After weeks, they realize that no one is coming to
   save them. Frank, a paraplegic, commits suicide so Jeevan doesn't feel
   responsible for him. Jeevan embarks on a journey south, and after many
   years, finds a new settlement where he marries and becomes the town
   doctor.

   In Year Zero, one of Arthur's friends, Clark, informs Elizabeth that
   Arthur is dead. Clark, Elizabeth and her son Tyler, happen to be on the
   same flight from New York City to Toronto to attend Arthur's funeral,
   until it is grounded at the Severn City Airport due to the pandemic.
   The passengers, having nowhere to go, create a settlement in the
   airport, and Clark becomes the "curator" of the Museum of Civilization,
   where he gathers artifacts such as iPhones and laptop computers. While
   most of the airport survivors adapt to their new life, Elizabeth and
   Tyler embrace religious zealotry, believing that the pandemic happened
   for a reason and spared those who were good. After two years, they
   leave with a religious cult.

   In the present, Kirsten and August find a group of the Prophet's men
   holding Sayid, a member of their troupe, hostage. They kill the men and
   free Sayid, who explains that their friend Dieter was killed, while
   another hostage escaped, warned the troupe, and sent them on another
   road, explaining how they went missing. Kirsten, August, and Sayid
   leave for the Severn City Airport, but Kirsten is soon discovered by
   the Prophet himself. Just before he is about to kill her, he refers to
   the "Undersea," a place from the Dr. Eleven comics. Kirsten quotes
   lines from Dr. Eleven, distracting the Prophet long enough that a
   younger sentry (having a crisis of faith) shoots and kills him, before
   taking his own life. The trio continues to the Museum of Civilization
   where they are reunited with Charlie, Jeremy and the rest of the
   troupe. Clark, who has lived in the museum for twenty years, realizes
   who Kirsten is, her attachment to Arthur, and that the Prophet was
   Tyler Leander. Clark takes Kirsten up to the watch tower of the
   airport, where there is a town to the south with electric lights,
   showing that civilization is beginning to take root again.

   Five weeks later, Kirsten leaves with the Travelling Symphony for the
   town to the south. She gives one copy of Dr. Eleven to Clark's museum,
   as he begins to read it and recognizes a scene that is borrowed from a
   dinner party which he, Arthur and Miranda once attended.
