   The plot concerns a young female biochemist who discovers that a
   chemical extracted from an unusual strain of lichen can be used to slow
   down the ageing process, enabling people to live to around 200-300
   years. Wyndham speculates how society would deal with this prospect.

   The two central characters are Diana Brackley and Francis Saxover, two
   biochemists who run parallel investigations into the properties of a
   specific species of lichen after Diana notices that a trace of the
   specimen prevents some milk turning sour.

   She and Francis separately manage to extract from the lichen a new
   drug, dubbed Antigerone, which slows down the body's ageing process.
   While Francis uses it only on himself and his immediate family (without
   their knowledge), Diana founds a cosmetic spa, and builds up a
   clientele of some of the most powerful women in England, giving them
   low doses of Antigerone, preserving their beauty and youth. When
   Francis finds out about the spas, he erroneously assumes that Diana's
   motive is profit. Diana's aim, however, is actually female empowerment,
   intending to gain the support of these influential women, believing
   that if Antigerone became publicly known, it would be reserved only for
   the men in power.

   After a customer suffers an allergic reaction to one of Diana's
   products, the secret of the drug begins to emerge. Diana tries to cover
   up the real source of the drug, since the lichen is very rare and
   difficult to grow, but when it is finally discovered she fakes her own
   death in the hope of inspiring the women of Britain to fight for the
   rights she tried to secure for them.

   Francis realizes that Diana may not really be dead, and tracks her down
   to a remote farm where she has succeeded in growing a small amount of
   the lichen. Diana plans to rejoin the world under the guise of being
   her own sister, and continue the work she left off.
