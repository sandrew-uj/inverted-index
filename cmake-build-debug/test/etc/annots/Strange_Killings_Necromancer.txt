   A movie adaptation was planned by Legendary Pictures, with Rick
   Alexander penciled in as producer and Warren Ellis writing the first
   draft as well as being executive producer. Mike Wolfer was
   interviewed at NY Comic Con in 2010 and said his preferred actor would
   be Daniel Craig. In early 2012 it was announced that Tim Miller
   would be directing the film while Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell
   had been brought in to work on the script. As of June 2015, no
   further development on the film has been announced.
