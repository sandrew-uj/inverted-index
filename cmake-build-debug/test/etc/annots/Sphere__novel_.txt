   A group of scientists (psychologist Norman Johnson; mathematician Harry
   Adams; zoologist Beth Halpern; astrophysicist Ted Fielding; and marine
   biologist Arthur Levine), along with U.S. Navy personnel, travel to a
   deep sea habitat at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, where an enormous
   spacecraft has been discovered.

   During the descent Levine becomes claustrophobic and is returned to the
   surface. The other scientists arrive safely at Habitat DH-8. After
   their arrival and subsequent pressurization to the habitat's exotic-gas
   environment, the Navy sends a robot to enter the spacecraft first,
   which locates and opens a panel near the spacecraft door.

   As the robot's cameras focus on the opened panel, labels in English
   indicate the spacecraft is a U.S. spacecraft constructed in the future
   and sent through time, appearing on the seabed at least 350 years
   before its creation. The robot is unable to open a hatch leading
   further inside, forcing the team to don pressure suits and explore the
   spacecraft. In a large cargo hold, the team discovers a mysterious
   spherical object that is clearly of extraterrestrial origin.

   Reasoning the ship's future builders were apparently unaware that it
   had already been found in their past, Adams becomes convinced that the
   team will not survive to report their discovery.

   Remaining behind after the rest of the team returns to the habitat,
   Adams succeeds in opening and entering the sphere. Meanwhile, on the
   surface, a Pacific cyclone forces the supporting Naval ships to
   evacuate, trapping and isolating the scientists on the ocean floor for
   five days. Adams is found and returned to the DH-8 Habitat where he
   awakens with a terrible headache and little-to-no memory of how he
   opened the sphere or what occurred while he was inside. Immediately
   afterwards, the team is contacted by an intelligent, seemingly friendly
   alien entity that calls itself "Jerry".

   At first, Jerry communicates with the scientists using a numeric code
   transmitted to the habitat's computer. While the team struggles to
   communicate with Jerry, increasingly bizarre and deadly events occur,
   including the appearance of impossible sea creatures that Halpern
   claims cannot exist (such as shrimp with no digestive organs),
   confirmed when Jerry informs them he is "manifesting" the creatures.

   At this point, members of the team start to die in various attacks by
   giant squid, and the dwindling band of survivors struggle in their
   dealings with the unthinkably powerful, childlike, and temperamental
   alien entity. Johnson realizes he must use psychology to keep the
   remaining survivors alive (Johnson, Adams, Halpern).

   After re-translating the original code, Johnson realizes by
   transposition the entity's name should be "Harry" (Adams). Johnson
   hypothesizes that the sphere is an object which allows a person's
   subconscious thoughts to manifest in reality, and Harry Adams has
   acquired the power through entering it. (Confirmed by his childhood
   fear of squid, especially the giant squid in the novel Twenty Thousand
   Leagues Under the Sea, manifested in the form of a vast number of small
   squid and later a giant squid that attacks the DH-8 Habitat.)

   Johnson and Halpern sedate Adams and wait for contact to be
   re-established with the surface, but the manifestations continue.
   Halpern accuses Johnson of having entered the sphere and gaining access
   to the power. While unable to recall this incident, Johnson comes close
   to yielding, until he watches a security video of Halpern entering the
   sphere herself. Rejecting the notion, Halpern decides that Johnson is
   an imminent threat and defends herself by planting potent explosives
   around the spacecraft and habitat, and then attempts to suffocate
   Johnson by manipulating the habitat's life-support system.

   Escaping from the habitat, Johnson goes to the spacecraft and enters
   the presence of the sphere, then the sphere itself. Inside the sphere,
   he finds a large sea of translucent "foam," and has a conversation in
   his thoughts with some sort of entity that speaks in cryptic riddles,
   who eventually tells Johnson that the greatest power humans possess is
   the ability to imagine things. After leaving the sphere, Johnson
   decides to escape using the submarine docked at Habitat DH-7, a nearby
   habitat for Navy personnel, but cannot abandon the other survivors. Now
   empowered in the same way as Adams and Halpern, Johnson returns to DH-8
   and - using the submarine - the trio escape before the explosives set
   by Halpern count down and destroy the spaceship, the research habitat,
   and surrounding site.

   On the surface, confined to a decompression chamber, the trio ponder on
   what version of their story to tell the Navy. Realizing they could not
   control the power granted them by the sphere, they decide its knowledge
   to be too dangerous to be communicated, and resolve to use its power to
   remove it from themselves and alter their memories, replacing the
   fantastical experiences with more mundane memories of a technical
   failure. After the group forfeits their memories and power however, it
   is hinted that Halpern did not do the same.
