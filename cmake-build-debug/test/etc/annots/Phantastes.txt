   The tale starts the day after Anodos' twenty-first birthday. He
   discovers an ancient fairy lady in the desk that he inherited as a
   birthright from his late father. After the fairy shows him Fairy Land
   in a vision, Anodos awakes the next day to find that his room is
   transforming into a forest, which he soon finds to be Fairy Land
   itself.

   Anodos then encounters a woman and her daughter in a cottage who warn
   him about the evil Ash Tree and the Alder Tree. He is told that the
   spirits of trees can leave their tree-hosts and wander throughout Fairy
   Land. He then explores the world of the fairies, which live in flowers.
   He then has a nightmarish encounter with the spirit of the Ash Tree,
   escapes, and finds rest in the warmth and love of the Beech Tree's
   spirit.

   After this, he finds a marble statue by Pygmalion. After he sings to
   it, the statue flees from him. He pursues the Marble Lady, but finds
   instead the Maid of the Alder Tree in disguise. The Maid deceives
   Anodos into letting his guard down so the Ash can attack. He narrowly
   escapes doom, being saved by the knight Sir Percivale. Anodos then
   meets a woman and her daughter who believe in fairy tales and the magic
   of Fairy Land, despite the disbelief of the woman's husband. Anodos
   also finds his shadow, an evil presence that follows and torments
   Anodos throughout the rest of the story.

   Anodos finds a large palace with many rooms, including a bedroom
   labelled as his own. In the palace library, he reads the story of Cosmo
   of Prague. Cosmo is a believer in fantasy who sacrifices his life to
   free the soul of his lover from an enchanted mirror.

   Anodos spends much time in the palace. He comes upon corridors filled
   with still statues. Anodos explores the halls and realises that the
   statues dance in the halls, and return quickly to their pedestals when
   he enters. He dreams of the marble lady, that she alone has an empty
   pedestal among the statues. He later finds this pedestal and sings to
   it. The marble lady materialises on the pedestal, but flees him. Anodos
   follows, going into a strange subterranean world with gnome-like
   Kobolds that mock him.

   Anodos escapes this place and finds himself on the beach of a stormy
   sea. A boat takes him to an "island" with a cottage with four doors
   which is inhabited by an ancient lady. Anodos enters each door in turn,
   each containing a different world. In the first he becomes a child
   again, remembering the death of his brother. In the next door he finds
   the marble lady and Sir Percivale in love. Here Anodos makes a last
   outburst of his love for the marble lady. The next door recounts the
   death of a loved one of Anodos, and he finds his family mausoleum.
   Finally, Anodos travels through the last door ("the door of the
   timeless") but is saved by the ancient lady without remembering
   anything. The ancient lady says that because she saved him, he must
   leave via an isthmus before the island sinks underwater.

   Next Anodos finds himself with two brothers who are forging armour and
   swords in order to fight three marauding giants living in a fortified
   stronghold. Anodos joins them in their fight, but they are ambushed by
   the giants unprepared. The brothers die in the fight, but Anodos lives,
   killing the giants and becoming a hero of the kingdom. He journeys to
   tell a woman whom one of the brothers loved of the brothers' death, but
   along the way is captured by a manifestation of his shadow and
   imprisoned. Anodos escapes by the song of a woman whom he had met
   before in Fairy Land, and he is not troubled by his shadow again.

   Anodos again encounters Sir Percivale, becoming his squire. They come
   upon a cult of worshipers doing an unknown evil to a select few. Anodos
   decides to try to stop the ritual. He destroys the worshippers' idol,
   exposing a dark opening out of which a monster rushes to attack him. He
   kills the monster but is killed in the struggle as well. He floats as a
   spirit for a time before awakening alive on Earth, retaining the memory
   of his experiences in Fairy Land. His family informs him that he had
   only been gone 21 days, despite his seemingly long journey.
