   Following the publication of the well-regarded novels White Noise
   (1985), Libra (1988), and Mao II (1991), DeLillo made few public
   appearances and published little for several years while writing
   Underworld, besides the folio short story Pafko at the Wall which was
   incorporated into the prologue of Underworld with minor changes.

   According to DeLillo, the novel's title came to him as he thought about
   radioactive waste buried deep underground and about Pluto, the god of
   death.
