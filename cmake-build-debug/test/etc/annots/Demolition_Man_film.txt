   In 1996, psychopathic career criminal Simon Phoenix kidnaps a busload
   of hostages and takes refuge in an abandoned building. LAPD Sergeant
   John Spartan, nicknamed "The Demolition Man" for the large amounts of
   collateral damage he often causes in apprehending suspects, mounts an
   unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix. When a thermal scan of the
   area reveals no trace of the hostages, he raids the building and
   confronts Phoenix, who sets off explosives to destroy it. The hostages'
   corpses are later found in the rubble, and Phoenix claims that Spartan
   knew about them and attacked anyway. Both men are sentenced to lengthy
   terms in the city's new "California Cryo-Penitentiary", a prison in
   which convicts are cryogenically frozen and exposed to subliminal
   rehabilitation techniques.

   In 2032, the city of San Angeles - a megalopolis formed from the merger
   of Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara - is a seemingly peaceful
   utopia designed and run by Dr. Raymond Cocteau. Phoenix is thawed for a
   parole hearing and escapes from the cryo-prison by saying a secret
   password, without knowing how he had learned it. He subsequently
   murders his guards and the warden, making his way into the city where
   he easily overpowers and kills several police officers who have never
   had to deal with violent crime. Lieutenant Lenina Huxley, who is
   fascinated with 20th-century culture, reasons that the best chance to
   stop Phoenix is to enlist an officer with the experience and mindset
   needed to anticipate his actions. She persuades her superiors to parole
   Spartan and reinstate him to active duty. Spartan finds life in San
   Angeles to be sterile and oppressive, since all types of behavior
   deemed immoral or unhealthy, such as sports, alcohol, swearing, eating
   meat and having sex have been declared illegal. Conversely, many
   members of the police department and the public view Spartan as savage
   and uncivilized, while Huxley idolizes him.

   Anticipating that Phoenix will attempt to secure firearms, Spartan
   leads Huxley to a museum and finds Phoenix looting an exhibit of
   weapons. To Spartan's surprise, Phoenix is even deadlier than before,
   exhibiting expert-level proficiency in an extensive range of skills
   including martial arts and computer hacking. Phoenix escapes and holds
   Cocteau at gunpoint, but is unable to kill him, as Cocteau had
   implanted a command in his rehabilitation program to prevent him from
   doing so. Cocteau instead orders Phoenix to kill Edgar Friendly, the
   leader of a resistance group called the Scraps who refuse to conform to
   Cocteau's moral ideals and who live in the underground ruins of old Los
   Angeles.

   Spartan and Huxley witness this exchange on security cameras and review
   the cryo-prison records. They discover that Phoenix's rehabilitation
   program was tailored by Cocteau to make him even more dangerous than he
   was in 1996, including martial arts, computer hacking, knowledge of
   torture techniques, and murderous impulses; by contrast, Spartan's
   program taught him to knit and sew. As the pair deduce that Friendly is
   being targeted for murder, Phoenix persuades Cocteau to release
   additional cryo-prisoners for his gang and leads them underground to
   pursue Friendly. Having previously encountered the Scraps during a food
   raid at a restaurant, Spartan and Huxley venture underground and save
   Friendly from an assassination attempt by Phoenix. Phoenix taunts
   Spartan with the revelation that he had framed Spartan for the deaths
   of the 1996 hostages, who were already dead before the building
   exploded. Phoenix escapes to the cryo-prison, and Spartan pursues him
   with weapons provided by the Scraps.

   Unable to harm Cocteau, Phoenix has a gang member kill him instead and
   begins thawing out the cryo-prison's most dangerous convicts. Spartan
   incapacitates Huxley for her safety and fights Phoenix, breaking a vial
   of a cryogenic chemical that rapidly freezes Phoenix's body solid.
   Spartan kicks his head off, shattering it, and escapes as the
   uncontrolled quick-freezing effect triggers an explosion that destroys
   the cryo-prison. The police fear that the loss of Cocteau and the
   cryo-prison will end society as they know it, but Spartan suggests that
   they and the Scraps cooperate to combine the best aspects of order and
   personal freedom. He kisses Huxley and they leave together.
