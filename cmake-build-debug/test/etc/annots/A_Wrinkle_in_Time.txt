   One night, thirteen-year-old Meg Murry meets an eccentric new neighbor,
   Mrs. Whatsit, who refers to something called a tesseract. She later
   finds out it is a scientific concept her father was working on before
   his mysterious disappearance. The following day, Meg, her child genius
   brother Charles, and fellow schoolmate Calvin visit Mrs. Whatsit's
   home, where the equally strange Mrs. Who and the unseen voice of Mrs.
   Which promise to help Meg find and rescue her father.

   Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which turn out to be supernatural
   beings who transport Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe through
   the universe by means of a tesseract, a fifth-dimensional phenomenon
   explained as folding the fabric of space and time; this form of travel
   is called tessering. Their first stop is the planet Uriel, a Utopian
   world filled with Centaur-like beings who live in a state of light and
   love. The Mrs. Ws reveal to the children that the universe is under
   attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called The
   Black Thing, which is essentially the personification of evil. The
   children are taken to visit the Happy Medium, a woman with a crystal
   ball through which they see that Earth is partially covered by the
   darkness, although great religious figures, philosophers, scientists,
   and artists have been fighting against it. Mrs. Whatsit is revealed to
   be a former star who exploded in an act of self-sacrifice to fight the
   darkness.

   The children travel to the dark planet of Camazotz, which has succumbed
   to the Black Thing and where Meg's father is trapped because he would
   not succumb to the group mind that causes inhabitants to behave in a
   mechanical way. In order to find their father, Charles Wallace
   deliberately allows himself to be hypnotized. He takes Meg and Calvin
   to the place where Meg's father, Alexander, is being held prisoner.
   Charles Wallace then takes them to IT, the evil disembodied brain with
   powerful abilities that controls the planet. Using special powers from
   Mrs. Who's glasses, Alexander tessers Calvin, Meg, and himself to the
   planet Ixchel before IT can control them all. Charles Wallace is left
   behind, still under the influence of IT and Meg is paralyzed from
   injuries sustained during the trip. An inhabitant of the planet with
   featureless faces, tentacles and four arms proves to be both wise and
   gentle and cures Meg's paralysis.

   The trio of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which arrive and charge
   Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT. Arriving at the building
   where IT resides, they find Charles Wallace under IT's influence.
   Inspired by hints from the Mrs. Ws, Meg focuses all her love at Charles
   Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. They all then tesser
   back to Earth and the Mrs. Ws leave.
