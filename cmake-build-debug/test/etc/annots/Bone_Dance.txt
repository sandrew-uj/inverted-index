   In the opening scene, Sparrow cannot recall what took place in the
   preceding 36 hours. Awakening yet again in a novel place with new
   hurts, the urge to fix the problem is intense. On the way to
   enlightenment comes a cryptic Tarot reading from friend Sherrea,
   abduction by a dead man animated by what might as well be a Loa, and
   introduction to a Vodun-based community that is dedicated to
   replacement, and if necessary to overthrow, of the status quo in the
   city. The latter has the individual most responsible for the
   inter-continental war near its power apex, a character who is also the
   revenge target of another survivor from his kind. Those are the
   "Horsemen", modified people who can move their consciousness from body
   to body.

   The second half of the story shows Sparrow's awkward progress toward a
   fully human condition and becoming a valued member of a community, and
   is capped by a closing conceit: that the whole telling has been an
   autobiography.
