   The plot centers around Chevette Washington, a young bicycle messenger
   who lives in the ad hoc, off-the-grid community that has grown on the
   San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the aftermath of a devastating
   earthquake.

   Chevette, on a whim, steals a pair of dark-rimmed glasses from a man at
   a party because she is offended by his demeanor. Soon after, she
   realizes that the glasses have unlikely importance, as security company
   henchmen begin tracking and following her. Among the pursuers are
   Svobodov and Orlovsky, two Russian immigrants who reside in San
   Francisco and are employed as cops,^[3] as well as Loveless, a ruthless
   corporate hitman with gold canine teeth. The glasses contain plans by a
   powerful corporation to rebuild San Francisco entirely using
   nanotechnology, and for that reason, they are highly coveted and
   present a danger to the person who possesses them.

   Meanwhile, Berry Rydell, a former cop turned private security agent, is
   contracted to recover the pair of glasses for Lucius Warbaby, an
   intimidating and presumably successful "skip-tracer", a sort of
   bondsman/bounty hunter. When Rydell is given the mission, he is not
   informed of the significance of the glasses and the information they
   contain.

   Eventually, the plot climaxes when Rydell, Loveless, Warbaby, Orlovsky,
   and Svobodov all catch up with Chevette. The cops want the glasses, as
   does Rydell. Realizing the inherent danger of the situation, Rydell is
   forced to decide whom to side with. He decides to fight off Orlovsky
   and Svobodov and shirk his agreement with Warbaby. Instead, Rydell runs
   off with Chevette, and they embark upon a wild and treacherous journey
   in which they must remain one step ahead of their enemies, who have all
   the advantages of wealth and technology on their side. A subplot also
   focuses on a romantic relationship between Chevette and Rydell, which
   is initially restricted because of the nature of their circumstances,
   but is eventually allowed to flourish.

   Another subplot focuses on a Japanese sociologist named Shinya
   Yamazaki, who is currently studying the bridge dwellers and the history
   of their settlement. The subplot largely focuses on his interactions
   with Skinner, an old man who lives in a shack high atop one of the
   bridge's support pylons, who happens to share his home with Chevette.
