   Set four years before the events described in Pride and Prejudice and
   Zombies, the novel takes place in an alternate universe version of
   Regency era England where zombies are a well-known menace spawned by an
   event known as The Troubles.

   After attending a funeral in which a zombie rises from his coffin, Mr.
   Bennet decides that he must finally keep an old promise to train his
   five daughters in the art of zombie-killing. To this end, he turns the
   family's greenhouse into a dojo and hires young martial-arts expert
   Master Hawksworth to teach the girls. Meanwhile, a scientist named Dr.
   Keckilpenny arrives in the area with the dream of studying and possibly
   domesticating the zombies. As the zombie plague continues to spread
   across England, Hawksworth and Keckilpenny compete for Elizabeth's
   affections while Mrs. Bennet plots to find suitably wealthy suitors for
   both Elizabeth and her older sister Jane. In a bid to get
   reinforcements against the plague, Jane becomes the bodyguard of Lord
   Lumpley, a fat, lazy nobleman with low moral standards. Meanwhile,
   Elizabeth and Keckilpenny capture a zombie for further research.
