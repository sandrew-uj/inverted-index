   Gateway is a space station built into a hollow asteroid constructed by
   the Heechee, a long-vanished alien race. Humans have had limited
   success understanding Heechee technology found there and elsewhere in
   the solar system. The Gateway Corporation administers the asteroid on
   behalf of the governments of the United States of America, the Soviet
   Union, New People's Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United
   States of Brazil.

   There are nearly a thousand small, abandoned starships at Gateway. By
   extremely dangerous trial and error, humans learn how to operate the
   ships. The controls for selecting a destination have been identified,
   but nobody knows where a particular setting will take the ship or how
   long the trip will last; starvation is a danger. Attempts at reverse
   engineering to find out how they work have ended only in disaster, as
   has changing the settings in mid-flight. Most settings lead to useless
   or lethal places. A few, however, result in the discovery of Heechee
   artifacts and habitable planets, making the passengers (and the Gateway
   Corporation) extremely wealthy. The vessels come in three standard
   sizes, which can hold a maximum of one, three, or five people, filled
   with equipment and hopefully enough food for the trip. Some "threes"
   and many "fives" are armored. Each ship includes a lander to visit a
   planet or other object if one is found.

   Despite the risks, many people on impoverished, overcrowded, starving
   Earth hope to go to Gateway. Robinette Stetley Broadhead--known as
   Robin, Rob, Robbie, or Bob, depending on circumstances and his state of
   mind--is a young food shale miner on Earth who wins a lottery, giving
   him just enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway. Once
   there, he is frightened of the danger and delays going on a mission as
   long as he can. In the meantime he becomes romantically involved with
   two different women, eventually settling on Gelle-Klara Moynlin, his
   co-enabler in fearful delaying. Eventually he starts running out of
   money, and although he is terrified, he goes out on three trips. The
   first is unsuccessful and afterwards tension rises between Bob and
   Klara until they have a fight that suddenly turns into a vicious
   beating from Bob that seems to stem from repressed homosexual
   attraction. On the second trip, he makes a discovery through
   unauthorized experimentation, but the bonus he is awarded is offset by
   the large penalty for incapacitating the ship. On his third trip, the
   Gateway Corporation tries something different: sending two armored
   five-person ships, one slightly behind the other, to the same
   destination, one rejected as particularly hazardous by most ship's
   navigation computers. Bob signs up in desperation, along with Klara,
   who is struggling with her own fears.

   When the ships arrive, their crews find to their horror that they are
   in the gravitational grip of a black hole without enough power to break
   free. The crews devise a desperate escape plan: Move everyone into one
   ship and eject the other toward the black hole, thus gaining enough of
   a boost to escape. Working frantically to transfer unnecessary
   equipment to make room, Broadhead finds himself alone in the wrong ship
   when time runs out. He closes the hatch so that the plan can proceed.
   By chance, his ship is the one that breaks free, leaving the rest of
   the crew falling into the black hole.

   Broadhead returns to Gateway alone and receives the entire bonus. He
   feels enormous survivor guilt for leaving his crewmates, especially
   Klara, and is unsure whether he intended to sacrifice himself or the
   others, so once back on Earth as a wealthy man he seeks therapy from an
   artificial intelligence Freudian therapist program which he names
   Sigfrid von Shrink.

   The narrative alternates in time between Broadhead's experience on
   Gateway and his sessions with Sigfrid, converging on the traumatic
   moment near the black hole. Sigfrid helps him realize that, due to the
   gravitational time dilation of the black hole's immense gravity field,
   time is passing much more slowly for his former crewmates and none of
   them has actually died yet. Broadhead, however, concludes that this
   means that they will still be dying when he dies in several decades,
   with Klara still believing that he betrayed them to save himself.

   Also embedded in the narrative are various mission reports (usually
   with fatalities), roster openings, technical bulletins, and other
   documents Broadhead might have read on Gateway, adding to the
   verisimilitude. The economic side of living at Gateway is presented in
   detail, commencing with the contract all explorers must enter into with
   the Gateway Corporation, and including how some awards are determined.
