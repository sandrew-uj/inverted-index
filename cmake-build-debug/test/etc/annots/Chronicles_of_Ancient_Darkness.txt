   Chronicles of Ancient Darkness is a series of six historical fantasy
   novels by the British author Michelle Paver, her first books for
   children.^[1] The books chronicle the adventures of Torak, an
   adolescent boy, and his friends Renn and Wolf. The main story arc
   revolves around Torak and his quest to defeat the Soul Eaters, a group
   of power hungry mages who seek out to destroy all life in the forest.
   Paver has called it simply "a single story: the tale of Torak's
   discovery of himself and his world."^[1]

   Since the 30 May 2004 release of the first book in the series, Wolf
   Brother, the series has gained critical acclaim and commercial success
   worldwide. Wolf Brother became a national bestseller in the United
   States, and the rights to the series were bought by 20th Century Fox to
   be made into major motion pictures. In October 2013, Nick Hirschkorn's
   production company Feel Films picked up the film rights, with Will
   Davies attached as screenwriter.^[2]

   The books are set 6000 years ago in prehistoric Europe during the Stone
   Age. The main character, Torak, alone in the world, meets a lone,
   scared wolf cub, Wolf with whom he can communicate (having spent around
   three months in a wolf den as a baby). A girl named Renn, who is part
   of the Raven Clan, befriends them and supports them throughout the
   series. Torak's quest, along with Renn and Wolf, is to defeat the Soul
   Eaters, a group of former clan mages who have turned to evil, and who
   seek to control the forest.^[3] The story is told from three different
   third-person narratives: Torak, Renn and Wolf.

   For the concluding book Ghost Hunter (2009) she won the Guardian
   Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a
   panel of British children's writers.^[4]^[5]

   In 2019, Paver announced that she would be returning to the Chronicles
   of Ancient Darkness with three further books, set after the end of the
   main series, once again following Torak, Renn and Wolf. The titles of
   the books were announced as: Viper's Daughter, Skin Taker and Wolfbane.
