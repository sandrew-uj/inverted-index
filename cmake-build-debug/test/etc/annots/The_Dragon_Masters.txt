   Aerlith is a planet of rocks and wilderness orbiting a distant bright
   star known as Skene which appears as "an actinic point" in the daytime.
   The sky is described as being black rather than blue. The planet's
   rotation is slow, taking several days. It is so slow that dawn and dusk
   are accompanied by storms that follow the boundary between day and
   night around the planet. The night has an effect on the "Dragons" of
   the title, making them more vicious and unmanageable. This means that
   all movement of the armies must take place during daylight.

   Humans live in valleys where the soil is good. Occasionally they make
   war on each other across the hills, passes and fells between their
   valley homes. Their technology is limited to steel and gunpowder. They
   also use semi-precious stones for decoration.

   From time to time, often after many years, a spaceship appears and
   abducts as many humans as can be caught. The settlements are also
   bombarded, ensuring that humanity will not rise above its present
   technological level. During one such raid, a charismatic leader named
   Kergan Banbeck captures a group of the alien raiders, who are
   accompanied by their human servants. Without their masters, the humans
   go mad and destroy the ship. The aliens, many-limbed lizard-like
   creatures known as "grephs", become prisoners of the humans they came
   to kidnap.

   Many years later, Kergan's descendant, Joaz Banbeck, is troubled by two
   things. He believes the grephs will return soon, and his neighbor,
   Ervis Carcolo of the ironically named Happy Valley, is forever plotting
   against him. The captive grephs have been bred over the years into
   fighting creatures known as dragons, ranging from the man-sized
   "Termagant" to the gigantic "Jugger". As each new variety has been bred
   over the years, the fortunes of war have shifted between the Banbecks
   and the Carcolos. Now there is an uneasy peace.

   There is a third group of humans, the "Sacerdotes", mysterious ascetics
   who walk naked in all weathers. They are characterized by very long
   hair, pale complexions, and the golden torc each wears around the neck.
   Only males are seen. They trade for what they need and seem to possess
   advanced technologies. They believe that they are beyond human, calling
   the rest of humankind "Utter Men", who will eventually disappear and
   leave the universe to them.

   Joaz Banbeck tries without success to convince Ervis Carcolo and the
   Sacerdotes of the need to prepare for the next visit by the grephs.
   Ervis Carcolo, far from cooperating, attacks Banbeck Vale, only to have
   his army routed by Joaz's ingenious tactics.

   Joaz is able to confine a Sacerdote and ask him questions, only to have
   the man apparently die. Taking his torc and making a wig from the man's
   hair, Joaz attempts to examine the Sacerdotes' cave home. They are
   definitely working on something big. Returning home, he is confronted
   by the Sacerdote he had thought dead, who demands the return of his
   torc and walks silently away.

   Subsequently, Joaz has a dream in which he talks to the sacerdote
   leader and tries to persuade him to help. The leader, known as the
   Demie, refuses, claiming that to involve himself in the affairs of
   Utter Men is to destroy the detachment necessary to their lifestyle.
   Joaz suspects they are building a spaceship.

   Ervis Carcolo attacks again. Once again, Joaz defeats him, but at that
   moment, the grephs reappear. Happy Valley is destroyed and Banbeck Vale
   is obviously next.

   Besides the power of the ship itself, the grephs have humans whom they
   have bred, just as the men of Aerlith have bred their dragons. The
   "Heavy Trooper" is physically equal to the Termagant, and a "Giant"
   matches the monstrous Jugger. Some of the humans have been bred to
   track people by smell, and still others are used like horses, like
   their dragon counterparts, the Spiders.

   The grephs attack, tentatively at first. Their troops are astonished by
   the dragons who so resemble their masters. The fighting is bloody and
   Joaz moves his people into caves and tunnels for safety. The grephs
   decide simply to bombard the Vale since they cannot take the people.
   Joaz has anticipated this, and lures them to a spot where he believes
   the sacerdotes' workshops are located.

   Carcolo, almost with his last remaining energy and backed by his now
   demoralized troops, assaults the ship from an unguarded quarter. Joaz
   coincidentally decides on a similar tactic, and is amazed to find
   Carcolo already inside. Together they free many people, but cannot gain
   control of the ship. The destruction of the Vale seems inevitable,
   until Joaz's scheme pays off. The Sacerdote cavern is blown open, and
   the Sacerdotes are forced to use the engine of their spaceship to
   project a beam of energy at the alien ship, disabling it. Joaz and his
   troops complete the rout and capture the ship. However, the Sacerdote
   ship is destroyed.

   The Demie is driven out of his detachment by what Joaz has forced him
   to do. He upbraids Joaz for causing the destruction of the work of
   centuries just to save himself. Joaz refuses to apologize, and when
   Carcolo, now a prisoner, absurdly continues to assert his claim to the
   ship, Joaz has him executed.

   At the end, Joaz surveys the ruins of his home. He picks up a small
   round object, a semi-precious stone carved to be a globe of Eden or
   Tempe or even Earth, the mythical home of humans. He plans to find the
   other worlds where humans live, if he can repair the alien ship. For
   now, he must rebuild the homes of his people. He tosses the globe back
   on the rockpile and walks away.
