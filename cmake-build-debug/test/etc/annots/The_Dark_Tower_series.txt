   In the story, Roland Deschain is the last living member of a knightly
   order known as gunslingers and the last of the line of "Arthur Eld",
   his world's analogue of King Arthur. Politically organized along the
   lines of a feudal society, it shares technological and social
   characteristics with the American Old West but is also magical. Many of
   the magical aspects have vanished from Mid-World, but traces remain as
   do relics from a technologically advanced society. Roland's quest is to
   find the Dark Tower, a fabled building said to be the nexus of all
   universes. Roland's world is said to have "moved on", and it appears to
   be coming apart at the seams. Mighty nations have been torn apart by
   war, entire cities and regions vanish without a trace and time does not
   flow in an orderly fashion. Sometimes, even the sun rises in the north
   and sets in the east. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals, and
   age are unclear, though later installments shed light on these
   mysteries.
