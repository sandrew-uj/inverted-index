   One evening, while being physically abused by his father, David "Davy"
   Rice unexpectedly teleports (or "jumps") and finds himself in the local
   library, the Stanville Library. This is a place that Davy is familiar
   with and spends a lot of time in, which is why he was able to easily
   teleport there. The origin of this power is never explained, but he
   ends up using this power continually throughout the novel. Vowing never
   to return to his father's house, Davy makes his way to New York City.
   After being mugged and discovering that he can't get a job without a
   birth certificate and/or social security number, Davy robs a local bank
   by teleporting inside the safe, stealing nearly a million dollars. He
   then begins a life of reading, attending plays, and dining in fancy
   restaurants.

   At a play, he meets a 21-year-old woman named Millie Harrison, and they
   spend some time touring New York before she returns to college in
   Stillwater, Oklahoma. Davy later visits her in Oklahoma, and they
   attend a party, where he accidentally runs into Millie's ex-boyfriend,
   Mark, who tries to fight him, forcing David to jump Mark away,
   unnoticed. Feeling bad for Davy, Millie invites him to stay the night
   at her place. The two officially start a romantic relationship and make
   love. Millie and Davy continue to see each other and begin to fall in
   love. Davy also manages to locate and reunite with his long-lost
   mother, Mary Niles. Mary left the family after being severely beaten by
   David's father, and all her attempts to contact David over the years
   were intercepted by his father.

   The New York police start investigating Davy after he saves a neighbor
   from an attack by jumping her abusive husband to a park; the husband
   turns out to be a police officer. The investigation drives Davy to move
   to Oklahoma, where he gets an apartment near Millie. One night while
   Davy is out, the police are in his New York City apartment when Millie
   calls. The police inform her of their investigation of him. Davy
   confronts Millie and tries to explain, but Millie breaks up with him
   and tells him to go. Out of anger, Davy jumps in front of her, back to
   his apartment in Stillwater.

   After a few weeks, Davy finds himself missing Millie and starts
   receiving letters from her, a way of reconciling.

   Mary, who was on a business trip, is murdered by terrorists when her
   plane is hijacked. Davy sets out to find Rashid Matar, the terrorist
   responsible for his mother's death. Davy starts jumping to Algeria to
   search for Matar, having to dodge the police almost every time he is
   there. While at Mary's funeral, Davy meets his father for the first
   time in years and is interrogated by the police again. While he is
   searching for the terrorist, he and Millie go out on their first date
   in months together. Davy tells her everything, even the bank robbery,
   which she's a little upset about. Despite everything that he has told
   her, his ability to jump and the money he stole, Millie confesses that
   she misses him and is deeply in love with him. Davy and Millie
   officially restart their relationship.

   However, the National Security Agency, led by veteran agent Brian Cox,
   becomes suspicious when it finds out he can get from Algeria to the
   United States in only a few hours. When he is questioned, Davy jumps
   out of the NSA office, witnessed by Cox and several other agents. Cox
   and the NSA then become determined to capture Davy so they can use his
   powers. David has Millie go stay with her parents, while at the same
   time they see each other in secret. After numerous failures to grab
   Davy, Cox takes Millie hostage in order to get to him. Davy strikes
   back by grabbing Cox, and later captures Matar and his abusive
   father--thereby putting him in the unique position of controlling the
   fates of all three of his tormentors.

   This experience has profound effects on all four of them. Davy finds
   himself unable to kill his captives despite their crimes against him
   and ultimately releases them. Davy turns Matar over to the authorities,
   threatening to come after him again if he isn't found guilty of his
   crimes. His father is forced to acknowledge his abuse of Davy and Mary
   and enters alcoholic counseling. Cox is forced to see the similarities
   between his actions and those of the terrorist and the wife-beating
   alcoholic, has Millie released, and agrees to stop hunting Davy. Both
   Davy and Millie go away with each other.

   Afterward, Millie comforts Davy as he realizes that he cannot escape
   his pain through teleportation or vigilante action, and he enters
   counseling as well.
