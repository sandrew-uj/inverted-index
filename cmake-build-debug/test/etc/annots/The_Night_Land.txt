   The beginning of the book establishes the framework in which a
   17th-century gentleman, mourning the death of his beloved, Lady
   Mirdath, is given a vision of a far-distant future where their souls
   will be re-united, and sees the world of that time through the eyes of
   a future incarnation. The language and style used are intended to
   resemble those of the 17th century, though the prose has features
   characteristic of no particular period, such as an almost complete lack
   of dialogue or proper names. Ian Bell has suggested that John Milton's
   epic poem "Paradise Lost" (1667) was probably a partial inspiration for
   Hodgson's novel, especially in view of the hellish visions of sombre
   intensity that mark both works, and the use of massive structures (the
   Temple of Pandemonium in Milton and the Last Redoubt in The Night
   Land).^[3]

   The 17th-century framing becomes inconsequential as the story focuses
   on the future. The Sun has gone out and the Earth is lit only by the
   glow of residual vulcanism. The last few millions of the human race are
   gathered together in the Last Redoubt, a gigantic metal pyramid, nearly
   eight miles high, which is under siege from unknown forces and Powers
   outside in the dark. These are held back by a shield known as the "air
   clog", powered from a subterranean energy source called the "Earth
   Current". For thousands of years vast living shapes known as the
   Watchers have waited in the darkness near the pyramid. It is thought
   that they are waiting for the inevitable time when the Circle's power
   finally weakens and dies. Other living things have been seen in the
   darkness, some of unknown origins, and others that may once have been
   human. Hodgson uses the term "Abhuman" to name several different
   species of intelligent beings evolved from humans who interbred with
   alien species or adapted to changed environmental conditions, and are
   seen as decayed or malign by those living inside the Last Redoubt.

   To leave the protection of the Circle means almost certain death, or,
   worse, destruction of the soul. The narrator establishes mind contact
   with an inhabitant of a forgotten Lesser Redoubt. First, one expedition
   sets off to succour the inhabitants of the Lesser Redoubt, whose own
   Earth Current has been exhausted, only to meet with disaster. After
   that the narrator sets off alone into the darkness to find the girl he
   has made contact with, knowing now that she is the reincarnation of his
   past love.

   At the conclusion of the adventure the narrative does not return to the
   framework story, but ends with the homecoming of the couple and the
   narrator's inauguration into the ranks of their most honoured heroes.
