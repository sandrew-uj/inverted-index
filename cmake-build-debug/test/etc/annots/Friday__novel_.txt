   The book's narrator is Friday Jones (often going under cover name
   Marjorie Baldwin and using both surnames somewhat interchangeably).
   Friday is a genetically engineered human (known as an Artificial Person
   or AP) in many ways mentally and physically superior to ordinary
   humans. There is great prejudice against APs so Friday conceals her
   status.

   Employed as a highly self-sufficient "combat courier in a
   quasi-military organization", traveling across the globe and to some of
   the near-Earth space colonies. Friday is returning from her latest
   mission when she is captured, tortured, raped and interrogated by an
   enemy group. She is rescued by her own people, who tell her that her
   highly critical mission was successful as her captors failed to find
   the data she was carrying in her body.

   After recovering from the ordeal, Friday takes a vacation to New
   Zealand to visit her group family, composed of several husbands and
   wives and many children. In an argument over racism, Friday reveals to
   her family that she is an AP, and they promptly divorce her.

   On the way back to her company's headquarters, she meets and befriends
   a married couple, the Tormeys, and their extra-legal co-husband,
   Georges. Friday is their house-guest in British Canada (a country in
   the Balkanized North America) when a worldwide emergency known as Red
   Thursday occurs. Various groups claim credit for the assassinations and
   sabotage, but Friday later learns that it is the result of a struggle
   between rival factions within the ultra-powerful Shipstone corporation.

   With British Canada under martial law, Friday kills a policeman who
   tries to arrest her and Georges as non-citizens to be interned. The two
   become fugitives, and Friday travels through the California
   Confederacy, the Lone Star Republic (where she parts from Georges), and
   the Chicago Imperium as she attempts to reach her headquarters. After
   several adventures, she abandons her attempt to make contact with her
   employer and then finds that the Tormeys are not at their home. An
   agent of her employer finally tracks her down. However, Friday's boss
   soon dies and the organization disbands, rendering her temporarily
   homeless and unemployed. Her boss has left her money in trust to be
   used only for the purpose of relocating to an off-Earth colony of her
   choosing.

   Living in Las Vegas Free State, Friday is eventually recruited for a
   courier job which will incidentally allow her to visit and evaluate
   several of the colonies she is considering as future homes. However, on
   an interplanetary cruise ship for her mission, she learns that agents
   of her new employers are watching her, and that she is a virtual
   prisoner on the ship. Realizing that her mission is top secret and her
   employers misled her about it, she fears that they will kill her when
   it is over. While the ship is in orbit at a rustic colony world, she
   escapes with the Tormeys, who have been on the run since the
   policeman's death and happened to be fleeing Earth on the same ship.
   She is helped and joined in her escape by two of the agents watching
   her, one of whom was among her torturers at the beginning of the story
   but is now repentant. After evading the ship's crew and the remaining
   agents, Friday and her friends settle in the colony to lead a quiet
   life as a group family.
