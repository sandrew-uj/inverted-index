   The novel is set almost 20 years after a plague has devastated the
   Earth's population. A few hundred people, most of them artists, live in
   San Francisco, California, and have built many large-scale artworks
   there out of salvaged materials. To the east, in the Central Valley, a
   military government headed by General Miles (nicknamed "Fourstar") has
   spread from Sacramento and annexed many other towns, including Fresno
   and Modesto. Miles dreams of recreating the United States of old and is
   planning to invade San Francisco, which he claims is populated by
   Godless sinners who are hoarding its resources.

   A nameless young woman, whose mother fled the city soon after the
   plague, has a vision of an angel at her mother's death. It leads her to
   believe she will be reunited with her mother in the city and inspires
   her to go there and warn its inhabitants of the coming invasion. While
   there, she meets the city's residents, acquires a name, and convinces
   them that the threat of invasion is real and spurs them into taking
   action to resist it. Believing that they cannot beat Fourstar using
   straightforward military methods, they improvise their own methods of
   demoralizing his army, and are aided by mysterious manifestations
   related to the city's past.
