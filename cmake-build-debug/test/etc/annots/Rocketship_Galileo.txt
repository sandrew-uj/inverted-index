   After World War II, three teenage boy rocket experimenters are
   recruited by one boy's uncle, Dr. Cargraves, a renowned physicist who
   had worked on the Manhattan Project, to refit a conventionally powered
   surplus "mail rocket". It is to be converted to run on a thorium
   nuclear pile which boils zinc as a propellant. They use a cleared area
   in a military weapons test range in the desert for their work, despite
   prying and sabotage attempts by unknown agents.

   Upon completion of the modifications, they stock the rocket, which they
   name the Galileo, and take off for the Moon, taking approximately three
   days to arrive. After establishing a semi-permanent structure based on
   a Quonset hut, they claim the Moon on behalf of the United Nations.

   As they set up a radio to communicate with the Earth they pick up a
   local transmission, the sender of which promises to meet them. Instead,
   their ship is bombed. However, they are able to hole up undetected in
   their hut and succeed in ambushing the other ship when it lands,
   capturing the pilot. They discover that there is a Nazi base on the
   Moon. They bomb it from their captured ship and land. One survivor is
   found, revived, and questioned.

   The boys also find evidence of an ancient lunar civilization, and
   postulate that the craters of the Moon were formed not by impacts from
   space, but by nuclear bombs that destroyed the alien race.

   When the base's Nazi leader shoots the pilot in order to silence him,
   Cargraves convenes a trial and finds him guilty of murder. Cargraves
   prepares to execute the prisoner by ejecting him into vacuum, mostly as
   a bluff for information on how to fly the base's spaceship. The Nazi
   capitulates in the airlock and teaches them how to fly the ship back to
   Earth.

   The boys radio the location of the hidden Nazi base on Earth to the
   authorities, leading to its destruction; they return as heroes.
