   Kevin Malone has a troubled childhood with history of abuses by his
   father. To escape the miseries of his real life, he creates a fantasy
   world called "Fayre Farre" in which he is "The Promised Champion", the
   hero of the world. Amy, a fourteen-year-old girl, enters this fantasy
   world one day while she is roller-skating at New York's Central Park.
   Amy has been running away from her own real-life problems. She has lost
   her cousin Shelly, and Amy's father wants the family to relocate to Los
   Angeles as he wants to pursue a career in Hollywood. The anticipation
   of losing her best friends by moving away depresses Amy. She
   accidentally enters the make-believe world of Kevin, her neighbor who
   used to bully her in the past.

   In Fayre Farre, The Promised Champion is losing his supremacy, as the
   evil "White Warrior Anglower" expands his armies to gain control over
   the kingdom. Through a series of adventures, Kevin wins over the White
   Warrior Anglower, taking help from Amy and her friends. At the end,
   Anglower is shown as the reincarnation of Kevin's father and Amy
   accepts the death of her cousin.
