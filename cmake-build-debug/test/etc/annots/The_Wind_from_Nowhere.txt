   A wind blows worldwide: it is constantly westward and strongest at the
   equator. The wind is gradually increasing, and at the beginning of the
   story, the force of the wind is making air travel impossible. Later,
   people are living in tunnels and basements, unable to go above ground.
   Near the end, "The air stream carried with it enormous quantities of
   water vapour -- in some cases the contents of entire seas, such as the
   Caspian and the Great Lakes, which had been drained dry, their beds
   plainly visible."^[4]

   In London, to cope with the situation, special organizations are set
   up. The Central Operations Executive (COE), staffed mainly by War
   Office personnel, has been set up by Simon Marshall.

   Combined Rescue Operations deal with collapsing buildings. Donald
   Maitland, a doctor unable to travel to a new job in Canada because of
   the wind, is part of it. Maitland rescues Marshall when he is injured
   by falling masonry and takes him home to recover. In the basement of
   Marshall's home, Maitland sees military equipment labelled "Hardoon
   Tower" and wonders whose interests Marshall is really serving.

   Hardoon Tower is a pyramid-like structure intended to withstand the
   wind; it is being built by Hardoon, a millionaire businessman, who has
   a private army.

   Maitland's relationship with his wife Susan is ending, but when he
   hears that she is still in their apartment on an upper floor, while
   most people are underground, he goes there. Susan will not be persuaded
   to leave, and standing by an open window, she is carried away by the
   wind.

   As the destruction increases in London, COE decides to abandon its
   underground base. One of Hardoon's officers, a helmeted, taciturn
   figure called Kroll, arrives. Marshall thinks he is there to take him
   to Hardoon Tower, but Kroll kills him.

   Maitland is evacuated from the underground base along with Steve
   Lanyon, an American submarine captain, and Patricia Olsen, a
   journalist. Lanyon and Olsen have developed a relationship during
   recent experiences in Italy. They are in a group that leaves in a giant
   armoured vehicle with a periscope. Maitland, realizing they are passing
   close to Hardoon Tower and wanting to investigate it, sabotages the
   navigation equipment so that the vehicle goes to the tower, which they
   can locate by a radio signal.

   Hardoon receives the group so that Olsen, the journalist, can report
   his success. The pyramid, built over tunnels which are collapsing,
   starts to fall over in the wind, and Hardoon, gazing at the wind
   through a special window, cannot be saved. Maitland and the others,
   trying to escape from the destruction, realize that they are saved
   because the wind is starting to subside.
