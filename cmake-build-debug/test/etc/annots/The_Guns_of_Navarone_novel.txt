   The island of Navarone, off the Turkish coast, has been heavily
   fortified as the Germans attempt to stifle British naval activity in
   the Aegean. A force of twelve hundred British soldiers is now marooned
   on the nearby island of Kheros (another variation of the island Keros,
   which is situated to the west of Amorgos) and the Royal Navy is
   planning to send ships to rescue them. The heavy radar-controlled guns
   command the only deepwater channel that ships can use and must be
   silenced at all costs.

   Commando attacks have failed and after a bombardment by B-24 Liberator
   bombers fails to destroy the guns, Captain James Jensen RN, Chief of
   Operations for SOE in Cairo, decides to launch a desperate last-ditch
   attempt which he has already planned in case the bombing is
   unsuccessful. He has drawn together a team of specialist saboteurs to
   infiltrate the island via the "unclimbable" south cliff and get into
   the fortress to destroy the guns. They have less than one week.

   The team meet for the first time in Alexandria. They comprise:
     * Captain Keith Mallory - a New Zealand officer with the Long Range
       Desert Group (LRDG). Mallory was a pre-war mountain climber,
       nicknamed "The Human Fly". He has been operating in the mountains
       of German-held Crete.
     * Andrea - a former Lt. Colonel in the Greek army, a ruthless fighter
       and close friend and confidante of Mallory.
     * Corporal Dusty Miller - an American explosives expert who
       transferred from the R.A.F. to the LRDG. Miller is described as a
       stringy, cynical man who doubts their chances of success.
     * Petty Officer Telegraphist Casey Brown - a Royal Navy engineer and
       veteran of the Special Boat Service. He is a native of Clydeside
       and worked as a testing and installation engineer pre-war.
     * Lt Andrew Stevens R.N.V.R. - Stevens is a young naval officer
       chosen as navigator. Like Mallory, he speaks fluent Greek and is an
       experienced mountaineer but considers himself an abject coward.

   The team travel via MTB and plane to Castelrosso, a British-held
   island. Here, they discover an eavesdropper, Nikolai the base laundry
   boy, who allegedly speaks no English but is spying on them anyway. They
   demand that he be arrested and held incommunicado, but the story
   implies that this does not happen.

   In an ancient caique they sail towards Navarone. They carry papers
   identifying themselves as collaborators with, and couriers for, the
   German commandant of the island. They are intercepted by a German
   patrol boat, which appears to be expecting them. They sink it and kill
   all the crew.

   They are wrecked in a storm but manage to land on the island, having
   lost much of their equipment. They climb the 'unclimbable' south cliff,
   but Stevens slips and is badly injured.

   Evading German guards, they travel through heavy snow and rough terrain
   and are met by Louki, the steward of the exiled owner of the island,
   and Panayis, his enigmatic friend. They bring much needed food. By
   radio, Jensen tells the team that they have less time than was planned
   for. The ships are coming through that very night. But whilst resting
   in a cave, they are captured by a troop of German specialist mountain
   soldiers led by Oberleutnant Turzig, who recognises Mallory as a famous
   climber. They are taken to the town of Margaritha where they are
   ruthlessly interrogated by Hauptmann Skoda. Thanks to Andrea's
   diversionary behaviour, they turn the tables on them and Skoda is shot.
   With Turzig and the others securely tied up, they escape and make their
   way to the town of Navarone. They are harassed by troops and planes who
   are also apparently expecting them.

   With no medical facilities available, Stevens is clearly dying and
   beyond help. He asks to be left behind and feels curiously at peace.
   Miller discovers that much of his equipment has been damaged. Suspicion
   falls on Panayis, who is also suspected of being a double agent. He
   admits nothing, but the evidence is damning. Miller shoots him.

   Mallory and Miller manage to enter the fortress housing the guns,
   whilst the others create a diversion. They set the explosives and then
   get out to meet the others. They steal a boat and rendezvous with the
   destroyer HMS Sirdar, which is leading two others through the deepwater
   channel. Just in time, the explosives do their work, the guns are
   destroyed and the ships continue on their way to rescue the soldiers.
