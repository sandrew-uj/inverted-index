   United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper is commander
   of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the 843rd Bomb Wing, flying
   B-52 bombers armed with hydrogen bombs. The planes are now on airborne
   alert two hours from their targets inside the USSR.

   General Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel
   Mandrake of the Royal Air Force (RAF), to put the base on alert and to
   issue "Wing Attack Plan R" to the patrolling bombers, one of which is
   commanded by Major T. J. "King" Kong. All of the aircraft commence
   attack flights on the USSR and set their radios to allow communications
   only through their CRM 114 discriminators, which was designed to accept
   only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only
   to General Ripper. Mandrake discovers that no attack order has been
   issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in
   his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have
   been fluoridating American water supplies to pollute the "precious
   bodily fluids" of Americans. Mandrake realizes Ripper has gone insane.

   In the War Room at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs
   President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how "Plan R" enables
   a senior officer to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack on the Soviets
   if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on the United
   States. It would take two days to try every CRM code combination to
   issue the recall order, but the planes are due to reach their targets
   within hours. Muffley orders the U.S. Army to storm the base and arrest
   General Ripper. Turgidson then attempts to convince Muffley to let the
   attack continue, but Muffley refuses. Instead, he brings Soviet
   ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone Soviet
   Premier Dimitri Kissov on the "hotline". Muffley warns the Premier of
   the impending attack, and offers to reveal the positions of the bombers
   and their targets so that the Soviets can protect themselves.

   After a heated discussion in Russian with the Premier, the ambassador
   informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union had created a doomsday
   machine as a nuclear deterrent; it consists of many buried bombs
   jacketed with "cobalt-thorium G", which are set to detonate
   automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. The
   cobalt-thorium G would then encircle the planet in a radioactive shroud
   for 93 years, rendering the Earth's surface uninhabitable. The device
   cannot be deactivated, as it is programmed to explode if any such
   attempt is made. The President's wheelchair-bound scientific advisor,
   former Nazi German Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday
   machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it;
   Alexei replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its
   existence to the world the following week.

   U.S. Army troops arrive at Burpelson, and General Ripper commits
   suicide. Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter
   and relays it to the Pentagon. Using the code, Strategic Air Command
   successfully recalls all of the bombers except Major Kong's, whose
   radio equipment has been damaged in a missile attack. The Soviets
   attempt to find it, but Kong has the bomber attack a closer target due
   to dwindling fuel. As the plane approaches the new target, a Soviet
   ICBM site, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Kong
   enters the bay and repairs the broken electrical wiring while sitting
   on a H-bomb, whereupon the doors open and the bomb is dropped. Kong
   joyfully straddles the bomb as it falls and detonates over the target.

   Back in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President
   gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground
   mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1
   female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth
   once the radiation has subsided. Worried that the Soviets will do the
   same, Turgidson warns about a "mineshaft gap" while Alexei secretly
   photographs the war room. Dr. Strangelove declares he has a plan, then
   suddenly rises from his wheelchair and exclaims, "Mein Fuehrer, I can
   walk!" as the Doomsday Machine activates. The film then abruptly ends
   with a montage of numerous nuclear explosions, accompanied by Vera
   Lynn's rendition of the song "We'll Meet Again".
