   Eleven-year-old Gregor is left home alone in his family's New York City
   apartment to watch his sister and grandmother. When Gregor's baby
   sister Boots falls through an old air duct grate in the building's
   basement, he dives in after her. The two fall miles below into the
   Underland: a subterranean world home to humans with near-translucent
   skin; giant sentient bats, rodents, and insects; and an escalating
   conflict between the human city of Regalia and the rats' King Gorger.
   They meet several "Underlanders", among them the Regalians' crown
   princess Luxa, her cousin Henry, and the bats who are "bonded" to them.
   At first, Gregor wants only to return home, but when he is attacked by
   two rats during an escape attempt and saved by the Underlanders, he
   inadvertently brings the conflict between the two groups to a head.

   It is then that he learns the real reason for the rats' hatred of
   Overlanders: a mysterious prophecy written by the human colony's
   founder Bartholomew of Sandwich hints that an Overland "warrior" will
   stop an attempt by the rats to take over the underground realm once and
   for all. The Regalian council believes Gregor to be this warrior, and
   tries to convince him to undertake the quest mentioned in the "Prophecy
   of Gray". Though he sympathizes, Gregor is reluctant to help until he
   learns a surprising fact: his father, who disappeared unexpectedly over
   two years before, had actually fallen down into Regalia just like
   Gregor and Boots and been taken prisoner by the rats. Gregor, his
   sister, and a group of Regalians go on a journey to rescue Gregor's
   father and recruit allies for a war against the rats.

   The quest group is challenged to successfully recruit allies for the
   Regalians, and then journeys to find Gregor's dad emaciated and
   tortured in the personal prison of King Gorger. When the rat king
   discovers their rescue attempt, Henry reveals that he has been helping
   the rats all along, hoping to ally them with the Regalians and conquer
   the entire Underland. During the questers' attempt to escape, Gregor
   sacrifices himself to lure the rats' attack force -- King Gorger and
   Henry among them -- off the edge of a cliff. Henry's bat Ares, who had
   no knowledge of his bond's treachery, chooses to save Gregor rather
   than Henry as they fall. When the few remaining quest members make it
   back to Regalia, Luxa and her family are devastated, both because of
   Henry's treason and death and because Ares has been sentenced to
   banishment (essentially a death sentence in the Underland) for allowing
   his bond to die. Gregor saves his life by using his status as the
   "warrior" to form a new bond with him. When things have settled down
   somewhat and the Regalian doctors have done all they can for his
   father, Gregor and his family return to the surface.
