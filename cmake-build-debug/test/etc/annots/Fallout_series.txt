   Fallout's U.S. flag shown here is inspired by the Cowpens flag, but the
   center star is enlarged to represent the nation as a whole.

   The series is set in a fictionalized United States in an alternate
   history scenario that diverges from reality following World War
   II. In this alternative atompunk "golden age", development of the
   transistor is not a priority. As such, a bizarre
   socio-technological status quo emerges, in which advanced robots,
   nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic
   technologies are seen alongside 1950s-era computers and televisions.
   The United States divides itself into 13 commonwealths and the
   aesthetics and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the
   American lifestyle well into the 21st century.

   More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy
   crisis emerged caused by the depletion of petroleum reserves, leading
   to a period called the "Resource Wars" in April 2052 - a series of
   events which included a war between the European Commonwealth and the
   Middle East, the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. invasion of
   Mexico and annexation of Canada, and a Chinese invasion and subsequent
   military occupation of Alaska coupled with their release of the "New
   Plague" that devastated the American mainland. These eventually
   culminated in the "Great War" on the morning of October 23, 2077,
   eastern standard time, a two-hour nuclear exchange on an apocalyptic
   scale, which subsequently created the post-apocalyptic United States,
   the setting of the Fallout world.
