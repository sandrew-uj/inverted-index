   Colonel Herncastle, an unpleasant former soldier, brings the Moonstone
   back with him from India where he acquired it by theft and murder
   during the Siege of Seringapatam. Angry at his family, who shun him, he
   leaves it in his will as a birthday gift to his niece Rachel, thus
   exposing her to attack by the stone's hereditary guardians, who will
   stop at nothing to retrieve it.

   Rachel wears the stone to her birthday party, but that night it
   disappears from her room. Suspicion falls on three Indian jugglers who
   have been near the house; on Rosanna Spearman, a maidservant who begins
   to act oddly and who then drowns herself in a local quicksand; and on
   Rachel herself, who also behaves suspiciously and is suddenly furious
   with Franklin Blake, with whom she has previously appeared to be
   enamoured, when he directs attempts to find it. Despite the efforts of
   Sergeant Cuff, a renowned detective, the house party ends with the
   mystery unsolved, and the protagonists disperse.

   During the ensuing year there are hints that the diamond was removed
   from the house and may be in a London bank vault, having been pledged
   as surety to a moneylender. The Indian jugglers are still nearby,
   watching and waiting. Rachel's grief and isolation increase, especially
   after her mother dies, and she first accepts and then rejects a
   marriage proposal from her cousin Godfrey Ablewhite, a philanthropist
   who was also present at the birthday dinner and whose father owns the
   bank near Rachel's old family home. Finally Franklin Blake returns from
   traveling abroad and determines to solve the mystery. He first
   discovers that Rosanna Spearman's behavior was due to her having fallen
   in love with him. She found evidence (a paint smear on his
   nightclothes) that convinced her that he was the thief and concealed it
   to save him, confusing the trail of evidence and throwing suspicion on
   herself. In despair at her inability to make him acknowledge her
   despite all she had done for him, she killed herself, leaving behind
   the smeared gown and a letter he did not receive at the time because of
   his hasty departure abroad.

   Now believing that Rachel suspects him of the theft on Rosanna's
   evidence, Franklin engineers a meeting and asks her. To his
   astonishment she tells him she actually saw him steal the diamond and
   has been protecting his reputation at the cost of her own even though
   she believes him to be a thief and a hypocrite. With hope of redeeming
   himself he returns to Yorkshire to the scene of crime and is befriended
   by Mr. Candy's assistant, Mr. Ezra Jennings. They join together to
   continue the investigations and learn that Franklin was secretly given
   laudanum during the night of the party (by the doctor, Mr. Candy, who
   wanted revenge on Franklin for criticising medicine); it appears that
   this, in addition to his anxiety about Rachel and the diamond and other
   nervous irritations, caused him to take the diamond in a narcotic
   trance, to move it to a safe place. A re-enactment of the evening's
   events confirms this, but how the stone ended up in a London bank
   remains a mystery solved only a year after the birthday party when the
   stone is redeemed. Franklin and his allies trace the claimant to a
   seedy waterside inn, only to discover that the Indians have got there
   first: the claimant is dead and the stone is gone. Under the dead man's
   disguise is none other than Godfrey Ablewhite, who is found to have
   embezzled the contents of a trust fund in his care and to have been
   facing exposure soon after the birthday party. The mystery of what
   Blake did while in his drugged state is solved: he encountered
   Ablewhite in the passageway outside Rachel's room and gave the
   Moonstone to him to be put back in his father's bank, from which it had
   been withdrawn on the morning of the party to be given to Rachel.
   Seeing his salvation, Ablewhite pocketed the stone instead, and pledged
   it as surety for a loan to save himself temporarily from insolvency.
   When he was murdered, he was on his way to Amsterdam to have the stone
   cut; it would then have been sold to replenish the plundered trust fund
   before the beneficiary inherited.

   The mystery is solved, Rachel and Franklin marry, and in an epilogue
   from Mr. Murthwaite, a noted adventurer, the reader learns of the
   restoration of the Moonstone to the place where it should be, in the
   forehead of the statue of the god in India.
