   In the future, mankind has tried to develop artificial intelligence,
   succeeding only once, and then disastrously. A transmission from the
   project site on an island in the Puget Sound, "rogue consciousness!",
   was followed by slaughter and destruction, culminating in the island
   vanishing from the face of the earth.

   The current project is being run on the moon, and the book tells the
   story of the seventh attempt in a series of experiments to create an
   artificial consciousness. For each attempt the scientists raise a group
   of clones. These clones are kept isolated and raised to believe that
   they will be the crew of a spaceship that will colonize a planet in the
   Tau Ceti solar system (Tau Ceti has no habitable planet; its
   choice--should they manage to reach it--is part of the planned
   frustration of the crew). The spaceship will take hundreds of years to
   reach the system and the crew will spend most of their time in
   hibernation. Along with the crew of six, the ship carries thousands of
   other clones in hibernation, intended to populate the new colony and,
   if necessary, provide replacements for any crew members who die along
   the way.

   The crew are just caretakers: the ship is controlled by a disembodied
   human brain, called "Organic Mental Core" or "OMC", that runs the
   complex operations of the vessel and keeps it moving in space. But the
   first two OMCs (Myrtle and Little Joe) become catatonic, while the
   third OMC goes insane and kills two of the umbilicus crew members. The
   crew are left with only one choice: to build an artificial
   consciousness that will enable the ship to continue. The crew knows
   that if they attempt to turn back they will be ordered to abort (self
   destruct).

   The clones have been bred and carefully selected for psychological
   purposes to reinforce each other, as well as to provide various
   specialized skills that will give them the best chance of success. The
   crew includes a chaplain-psychiatrist, Raja Flattery, who knows their
   real purpose, and that the breakdown of the "OMC"s was planned. He's
   aware that six other ships have gone out before theirs, each one
   failing. He understands the nature of the test: create a high pressure
   environment in which brilliance may break through out of necessity, and
   create in the safety of the void what humans couldn't safely create on
   Earth. Space Ship Earthling number Seven ultimately succeeds, and the
   consequences of their success form the basis of the plot for the novels
   which follow.
