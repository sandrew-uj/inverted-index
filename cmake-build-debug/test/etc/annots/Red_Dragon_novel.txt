   In 1975, Will Graham, a brilliant profiler of the FBI, captured the
   serial killer Hannibal Lecter. However, Graham suffered serious
   injuries from the encounter and retired afterwards. Five years later,
   in 1980, a serial killer nicknamed "The Tooth Fairy" stalks and murders
   seemingly random families during sequential full moons. He first kills
   the Jacobi family in Birmingham, Alabama, then the Leeds family in
   Atlanta, Georgia. Two days after the Leeds murders, agent Jack
   Crawford, Graham's mentor, goes to Graham's Marathon, Florida residence
   and pleads for his assistance; Graham reluctantly agrees. After looking
   over the crime scenes with only minimal insight, Graham realizes he
   must visit Lecter and seek his help to capture "The Tooth Fairy."

   "The Tooth Fairy" is revealed (to the readers) to be the production
   chief of a St. Louis film processing firm named Francis Dolarhyde. He
   is a disturbed individual who is obsessed with the William Blake
   painting The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun (which the
   book identifies as The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the
   Sun). Dolarhyde is unable to control his violent, sexual urges, and
   believes that murdering people--or "changing" them, as he calls
   it--allows him to more fully "become" an alternate personality he calls
   the "Great Red Dragon", after the dominant character in Blake's
   painting. Flashbacks reveal that his sociopathy is born from the
   systematic abuse he suffered as a child at the hands of both his
   sadistic grandmother and his family.

   As Graham investigates the case, he is hounded by Freddy Lounds, a
   sleazy tabloid reporter. Meanwhile, Lecter's de facto jailer, Frederick
   Chilton, discovers Lecter's secret correspondence, with which Lecter
   gives Graham's address to Dolarhyde. Graham's wife, Molly, and his
   stepson are evacuated. Graham tries to intercept the secret
   communication without Lecter's knowledge, but instead attracts the
   attention of Lounds.

   Lounds becomes aware of the correspondence and tries to trick Graham
   into revealing details of the investigation by posing as the Red
   Dragon, but is found out. Hoping to lure the Red Dragon into a trap,
   Graham gives Lounds an interview in which he deliberately
   mischaracterizes the killer as an impotent homosexual. This infuriates
   Dolarhyde, who kidnaps Lounds, forces him to recant the allegations,
   bites off his lips and sets him on fire, leaving his maimed body
   outside his newspaper's offices. Lounds is taken to the hospital, but
   dies from his injuries soon afterward.

   At about the same time, Dolarhyde falls in love with a blind co-worker
   named Reba McClane, which conflicts with his homicidal urges. In
   beginning a relationship with McClane, Dolarhyde resists the Dragon's
   "possession" of him; he goes to the Brooklyn Museum, beats a museum
   secretary unconscious, and eats the original Blake watercolor of The
   Red Dragon.

   Graham eventually realizes that the killer knew the layout of his
   victims' houses from their home movies, which were developed at the
   same film processing lab. Dolarhyde's job gives him access to all home
   movies that pass through the company. When he sees Graham interviewing
   his boss, Dolarhyde realizes that they are on to him and goes to see
   McClane one last time. He finds her breaking up with her previous
   boyfriend, Ralph Mandy, to be with Dolarhyde; McClane grants Mandy's
   request for a final kiss goodbye. Enraged with jealousy, Dolarhyde
   kills Mandy. He kidnaps McClane and, having taken her to his house,
   sets the place on fire. He says he intends to kill her and then
   himself, but finds himself unable to shoot her. The shotgun fires, and
   a body hits the floor. McClane escapes just before the house explodes.
   Graham later comforts her, telling her that there is nothing wrong with
   her, and that the kindness and affection she showed Dolarhyde probably
   saved lives.

   Believing Dolarhyde is dead, Graham's family moves back to the Florida
   home. However, Dolarhyde shows up at the house and after a violent
   struggle, stabs Graham in the face, leaving him with permanent facial
   scars, before being fatally shot by Molly. As Graham recovers, Crawford
   explains what happened. The dead man in Dolarhyde's house was a gas
   station attendant he'd had an altercation with; Dolarhyde had brought
   the man's body to his house to stage his own death, using McClane as a
   witness. Crawford intercepts a letter to Graham from Lecter, which bids
   him well and hopes that he isn't too disfigured, and destroys it in an
   incinerator.

   During his recovery, Graham has a flashback to a visit he made to
   Shiloh, the site of a major battle in the American Civil War, shortly
   after apprehending (and in the process, killing) Garrett Hobbs, a
   serial killer he investigated before Hannibal Lecter. Graham has an
   epiphany about the indifference of nature and decides that it is not
   nature that is haunted by events, as he had thought when visiting
   Shiloh before, but men who are haunted.
