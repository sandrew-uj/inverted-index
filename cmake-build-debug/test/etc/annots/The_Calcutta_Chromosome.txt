   The novel begins with the story of Antar, a resident of the future New
   York doing data processing for the International Water Council. A
   chance bit of data causes Antar to recall a bizarre encounter he had
   with L. Murugan, an employee of the LifeWatch organization (Antar's
   former employer), who disappeared in Calcutta in 1995. Murugan had
   asked to be transferred to Calcutta because of his fascination with the
   life of Sir Ronald Ross. While Antar tries to track Murugan's movements
   in Calcutta through the digitized archives, another narrative thread
   follows Murugan directly as his path brings him into contact with a
   variety of other characters, some more savory than others. The plot is
   quite complex and its timelines are deliberately mixed up, switching
   from Antar's time to Murugan's to Ross' and back over the course of as
   many chapters.

   Through his research into old and lost documents and phone messages,
   Antar determines that Murugan had systematically unearthed a deep
   secret lurking behind Ross' malaria research -- an underground
   scientific and mystical movement that could grant eternal life. Loosely
   described, the process of securing this form of immortality is as
   follows: the disciples of this movement can transfer their chromosomes
   into another's body, and gradually become that person or take over that
   person. In the novel, Ronald Ross did not discover the mysteries of the
   malaria parasite; it was a group of underground practitioners of a
   different, mystical "science," natives of India, who helped to guide
   Ross to the conclusions for which he is famous. These native Indians
   provided Ross with clues in the belief that in the moment Ross made his
   discovery, the parasite would change its nature. At this point, a new
   variant of malaria would emerge and the group's research using the
   chromosome-transfer technique would advance even further.
