   The third World War, which began in Iraq, North Korea, and Pakistan,
   and spread to China, climaxes with a full-scale global nuclear
   holocaust. Frank Castle, who years before was apprehended and
   incarcerated in Sing-Sing Prison, survives by taking refuge in a
   fallout shelter hidden in the prison's high-security block with a
   handful of other prisoners and prison officers. A year after the bombs
   fall, Frank leaves the prison and begins his journey to New York City,
   taking with him Paris Peters, an arsonist who expresses interest in
   Frank's mission to find another bomb shelter hidden deep beneath the
   former site of the World Trade Center.

   Frank and Paris travel across upstate New York, past the ruined remains
   of civilization, ignoring the radiation they know will kill them. They
   locate the Manhattan bomb shelter and gain access, where they fall
   unconscious. Both awaken in the infirmary, where the doctors reveal
   they will die within hours of radiation poisoning. Frank murders the
   doctor and the guards, taking their weapons and shooting his way
   through the shelter's security forces, arriving in a board room filled
   with the Coven, a group of generals, senators, oil magnates, and
   computer billionaires. Frank, having learned about the Coven from a
   prisoner at Sing-Sing who designed their shelter, blames them for
   escalating the War on Terror in the name of profit and the resulting
   global holocaust.

   As Frank is about to execute the Coven, they beg for mercy, revealing
   that other members, hidden in bases across the world, have
   self-destructed due to outbreaks of insanity. They reveal that they are
   the last people left on Earth - the last hope for humanity - but with
   the resources they control in the shelter, they can repopulate the
   world. But knowing that these people would doom the world again, Frank
   kills them all. When Paris asked why he doomed humanity, Castle says,
   "The human race. You've seen what that leads to." Frank then states
   that no mere arsonist would be in the high-security block, and Paris
   confesses that his crime, while planned as simple insurance fraud, also
   set fire to a kindergarten, killing several dozen children. Frank thus
   strangles him.

   Frank re-emerges into the irradiated Manhattan wasteland, hair falling
   out in clumps, fire burning his flesh as he starts walking to New York
   City's Central Park. In his mind, it is 1976, and he is going to try to
   arrive in time to save his family from their fate.
