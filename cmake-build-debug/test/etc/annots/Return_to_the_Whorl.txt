   The story, which is told by a narrator who identifies himself as Horn
   (the ostensible author of The Book of the Long Sun), is an account of a
   search "on three worlds" for Silk, the hero of the Long Sun cycle.
   However, the narrator's adventures continue as he writes, so that the
   manuscript is both a memoir of his past and a journal of his present.
   As the story progresses, the narrator's identity becomes increasingly
   complex and elusive. The writing style changes with each book, and the
   story is highly nonlinear, with narrative threads from different times
   told in parallel and story events related out of order as the narrator
   remembers or confronts them. As with many of Wolfe's novels, the
   narrator and the circumstances under which the book is being written
   are essential to understanding the story.
