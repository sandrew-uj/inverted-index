   Black Easter and The Day After Judgment deal with what sorcery would be
   like if it existed, and the ritual magic for summoning demons as
   described in grimoires actually worked. Its background was based
   closely on the writings of practicing magicians working in the
   Christian tradition from the 13th to the 18th centuries.
