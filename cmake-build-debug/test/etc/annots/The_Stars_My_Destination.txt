   At the time when the book is set, "jaunting"--personal
   teleportation--has so upset the social and economic balance that the
   Inner Planets are at war with the Outer Satellites. Gully Foyle of the
   Presteign-owned merchant spaceship Nomad--an uneducated, unskilled,
   unambitious man whose life is at a dead end--is marooned in space when
   the ship is attacked and he alone survives. After six months of his
   waiting for rescue, a passing spaceship, the Vorga, also owned by the
   powerful Presteign industrial clan, ignores his signal and abandons
   him. Foyle is enraged and is transformed into a man consumed by
   revenge, the first of many transformations.

   Foyle repairs the ship, but is captured by a cargo cult in the Asteroid
   Belt which tattoos a hideous mask of a tiger on his face. He manages to
   escape and is returned to Terra. His attempt to blow up the Vorga
   fails, and he is captured by Presteign. Unknown to Foyle, the Nomad was
   carrying "PyrE", a new material which could make the difference between
   victory and defeat in the war. Presteign hires Saul Dagenham to
   interrogate Foyle and find the ship and PyrE.

   Protected by his own revenge fixation, Foyle cannot be broken, and he
   is put into a jaunte-proof prison. There he meets Jisbella McQueen, who
   teaches him to think clearly, and tells him he should find out who gave
   the order not to rescue him. Together they escape and get his tattoos
   removed--but not with total success: the subcutaneous scars become
   visible when Foyle becomes too emotional. They travel to the Nomad,
   where they recover not only PyrE, but also a fortune in platinum.
   Jisbella is captured by Dagenham, but Foyle escapes.

   Some time later, Foyle re-emerges as "Geoffrey Fourmyle", a nouveau
   riche dandy. Foyle has rigorously educated himself and had his body
   altered to become a killing machine. Through yoga he has achieved the
   emotional self-control necessary to prevent his stigmata from showing.
   He seeks out Robin Wednesbury, a one-way telepath, whom he had raped
   earlier in the novel, and persuades her to help him charm his way
   through high society.

   Foyle tracks down the crew of the Vorga to learn the identity of the
   ship's captain, but each is implanted with a death-reflex and dies when
   questioned. Each time, Foyle is tormented by the appearance of "The
   Burning Man", an image of himself on fire.

   At a society party, Foyle is smitten with Presteign's daughter Olivia.
   He also meets Jisbella again--now Dagenham's lover--who chooses not to
   reveal Foyle's identity, although Dagenham has realized it anyway
   (Foyle's alias was implanted in his subconscious mind during Dagenham's
   interrogation). During a nuclear attack by the Outer Satellites, Foyle
   goes to Olivia to save her. She tells him that to have her, he must be
   as cruel and ruthless as she is.

   Robin, traumatized by the attacks, tries to buy her way out of her
   arrangement with Foyle with the name of another Vorga crew member.
   Foyle agrees, but immediately reneges. In response, Robin goes to
   Central Intelligence to betray him.

   Foyle learns that the captain of the Vorga joined a cult on Mars and
   has had all her sensory nerves disabled, making her immune to
   conventional torture. Foyle kidnaps a telepath to interrogate the
   captain, and learns that the ship did not rescue him because it was
   picking up refugees, taking their belongings, and scuttling them into
   space. He also learns that Olivia Presteign was the person in charge.
   Olivia rescues him from Martian commandos, as she sees in Foyle someone
   who can match her hatred and need to destroy.

   Driven by a guilty conscience, Foyle tries to give himself up to
   Presteign's lawyer, Regis Sheffield, who is known as a Terran patriot.
   Unfortunately, Sheffield turns out to be a spy for the Outer
   Satellites, and he captures Foyle. Sheffield tells Foyle that when the
   Nomad was attacked, Foyle was taken off the ship, transported 600,000
   miles away, and set adrift in a spacesuit to be a decoy to attract
   ships to be ambushed. Instead, Foyle space-jaunted--teleporting a
   cosmic distance, very much further than had been previously believed
   possible--back to the Nomad. Now, the Outer Satellites not only want
   PyrE, they want Foyle as well, to learn the secret of space-jaunting.

   Meanwhile, Presteign reveals that PyrE is activated by telepathy, and
   Robin is enlisted to trigger it to flush out Foyle. Bits of PyrE left
   exposed by Foyle's tests to determine its purpose cause destruction
   worldwide, but primarily at Foyle's abandoned encampment in St.
   Patrick's Cathedral, where Sheffield has brought him. The church
   partially collapses, killing Sheffield and trapping Foyle, unconscious
   but alive, over a pit of flame. Suffering from synesthesia brought on
   by the explosion affecting his neurological implants, Foyle jauntes
   through space and time as The Burning Man. Finally he lands in the
   future, where Robin telepathically tells him how to escape from the
   collapsing cathedral.

   Back in the present, Foyle is pressured to surrender the rest of the
   PyrE, which was protected from exploding by its Inert Lead Isotope
   container, and to teach mankind how to space-jaunte. He leads them to
   where the rest of the PyrE is hidden, but makes off with it and jauntes
   across the globe, throwing slugs of PyrE into the crowd at each stop.
   He asks humanity to choose: either destroy itself or follow him into
   space.

   Foyle now realizes the key to space-jaunting is faith: not the
   certainty of an answer, but the conviction that somewhere an answer
   exists. He jauntes from one nearby star to another, finding new worlds
   suitable for colonization, but reachable only if he shares the secret
   of space-jaunting. He comes to rest back with the cargo cult, where the
   people see him as a holy man and await his revelation.
