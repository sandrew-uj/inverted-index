   Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) was in eighth grade when she was kidnapped
   by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm). The Reverend held
   Kimmy and three other women captive for 15 years in an underground
   bunker and convinced them that a nuclear apocalypse had come, gone, and
   had left them the sole survivors of humanity.

   In the first season, the women are rescued, and go on to appear on the
   Today Show in New York City. After the show, Kimmy decides she does not
   want to return to Indiana, and does not want to be seen by everyone as
   a victim, so she starts a new life in New York City. Roaming around the
   city, Kimmy comes across landlady Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane).
   Kaushtupper offers Kimmy a chance to room with Titus Andromedon (Tituss
   Burgess) in her downstairs apartment. However, Kimmy has to find a job
   in order to get the apartment. Upon attempting to get a job at a nearby
   candy store, Kimmy sees a boy stealing candy. She pursues him back to
   his home, and ends up encountering his mother, Jacqueline Voorhees
   (Jane Krakowski), a Manhattan trophy wife, who mistakes her for a
   nanny, and whom Kimmy mistakes as someone trapped in a cult. Soon
   after, Jacqueline hires Kimmy as a nanny for her 10-year-old son.
   As Season 1 continues, Kimmy falls in love with a Vietnamese man, Dong
   (Ki Hong Lee) from her G.E.D. class, goes to court to testify against
   the Reverend, and discovers how the world has changed in the 15 years
   she was held captive.

   In the second season, Kimmy is sick of working for Jacqueline and gets
   a job at a year-round Christmas store and then as an Uber driver. She
   tries to get over Dong, who enters a green card marriage with another
   G.E.D. student and is eventually deported. As Kimmy tries to move on,
   so do Titus and Jacqueline, who both find boyfriends. Titus begins
   dating construction worker Mikey Politano (Mike Carlsen) and Jacqueline
   begins dating lawyer Russ Snyder (David Cross). Jacqueline also goes
   back to her Native American heritage and decides to take down the
   Washington Redskins, who her boyfriend's father happens to own. Kimmy
   reunites with Gretchen and Cyndee to save them from joining another
   cult and getting married on television, respectively. When Season 2
   ends, Titus leaves to be a performer on a cruise and Lillian protests
   the invasion of hipsters in her neighborhood, while Kimmy makes amends
   with her mother (Lisa Kudrow) after advice from her therapist (Tina
   Fey) before receiving a phone call from the Reverend in prison, telling
   her that they need to get a divorce.

   In the third season, Kimmy proceeds with the divorce from the Reverend
   but hits a snag when she learns that a devoted fan (guest star Laura
   Dern) wants to marry him. After getting her G.E.D., Kimmy decides to go
   to college and ends up at Columbia University, where she is popular but
   fails academically. She forms a friendship with Perry (Daveed Diggs), a
   philosophy and religion transfer student who, like Kimmy, doesn't fit
   in with the rich, elitist Ivy League students. Titus returns from his
   stint on the cruise harboring a secret and determined to coming home to
   Mikey with money and a job, he auditions for Sesame Street. However
   after the man auditioning Titus asks him to perform sexual acts on a
   puppet, Titus leaves and runs home to Mikey. However, Titus sees Mikey
   out with another man, and breaks up with him in true Beyonce fashion.
   Lillian is elected to the city council and attempts to block the
   construction of a supermarket chain for fear it will gentrify the
   neighborhood. She later starts a relationship with the owner of the
   chain (Peter Riegert). Meanwhile, Jacqueline and Russ execute their
   plan to force his family to change the name of the Redskins and Titus
   makes it big with the single "Boobs in California". At the end of
   season three, Titus vows to win Mikey back from his new boyfriend,
   Jacqueline finds a profession, and Kimmy lands a job at a tech
   start-up.

   In the fourth and final season, Kimmy is working at Giztoob, the tech
   company started by a former classmate at Columbia, and Jacqueline is
   representing Titus as his agent. After acting in an anti-bullying
   performance for a middle school, Titus gets a job as director of the
   school play and, in an attempt to impress Mikey, pretends to write and
   star in a superhero television show called "The Capist," starring Greg
   Kinnear. Meanwhile, Lillian's boyfriend Artie dies and she is put in
   charge of his adult daughter's trust. Kimmy reunites with Donna Maria,
   who is now a successful businesswoman. Outraged and inspired by men's
   rights activists, Kimmy writes a children's book that empowers girls
   and encourages boys to be kind; by the end of season four, Kimmy has
   found success as a children's author. Season 4 features two episodes
   that veer from the main plot. In the first, a standalone mockumentary
   episode, Jacqueline's former boy toy Doug, a.k.a. DJ Fingablast,
   creates a true crime documentary called Party Monster: Scratching the
   Surface, which sympathizes with the Reverend and paints Kimmy and the
   other Mole Women negatively. The second episode, "Sliding Van Doors",
   presents an alternate universe in which Kimmy is never kidnapped, Titus
   does not audition for The Lion King in 1998, Jacqueline does not marry
   Julian Voorhees, and Lillian runs a Latin street gang. The series
   concludes with each of the main four characters finding success and
   purpose in new ventures.
