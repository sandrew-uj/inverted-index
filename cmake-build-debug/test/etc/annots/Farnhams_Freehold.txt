   Hugh Farnham, a white middle-aged man, holds a bridge club party for
   his alcoholic wife Grace, law-graduate son Duke, college-student
   daughter Karen, and Karen's friend Barbara. During the bridge game,
   Duke berates Hugh for frightening Grace by preparing for a possible
   Soviet nuclear attack. When the attack actually occurs the group, along
   with Joe, the family's African American servant, retreat to the fallout
   shelter beneath the house.

   After several distant nuclear explosions rock the shelter, Hugh and
   Barbara become sexually intimate, after which the largest explosion of
   all hits the shelter. With only minor injuries, but with their bottled
   oxygen running low, the group decides to ensure that they will be able
   to leave the shelter when necessary. After exiting through an emergency
   tunnel, they find themselves in a completely undamaged, semi-tropical
   region apparently uninhabited by humans or other sentient creatures.
   Several of the group speculate that the final explosion somehow forced
   them into an alternate dimension.

   The group struggles to stay alive by reverting to the ways of the
   American pioneers, with Hugh as the leader--despite friction between
   Hugh and Duke. Karen announces that she is pregnant and had returned
   home the night of the attack to tell her parents. Barbara also
   announces that she is pregnant, but without mentioning that her
   pregnancy resulted from her sexual encounter with Hugh during the
   attack. Karen eventually dies during her labor, due to complications,
   along with her infant daughter the next day.

   Grace, whose sanity has been challenged by all these events, demands
   that Barbara be forced from the group or she will leave. Duke convinces
   Hugh that he will go with Grace to ensure her safety, but before they
   can leave, a large aircraft appears overhead. The group is taken
   captive by people of African ancestry, but is spared execution when Joe
   intervenes by conversation with their captives' leader in French.

   The group finds that it has not been transported to another world, but
   instead is in the distant future of their own world. A decadent but
   technologically advanced African culture keeps either uneducated or
   castrated whites as slaves. Each of the characters adapts to the sudden
   change in black/white roles in different and sometimes shocking ways.
   In the end, Hugh and Barbara reject the new era of slavery they find
   themselves in and attempt to escape, but are captured. Rather than
   execute them, Ponse, "Lord Protector" of the house to which they have
   been enslaved, asks them to volunteer for a time-travel experiment that
   will send them back to their own time.

   They return just prior to the original nuclear attack, and flee in
   Barbara's car. As they drive they realize that while Barbara had driven
   a car with an automatic transmission, this car--the same car in every
   other respect--has a manual transmission, and Farnham deduces that the
   time-travel experiment worked but sent them into an alternate universe.

   They gather supplies and flee into the hills, surviving the attack, and
   live out the rest of their lives.
