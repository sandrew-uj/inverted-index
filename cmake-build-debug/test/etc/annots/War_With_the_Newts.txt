   Only the last four of the book's 27 chapters deal with the eponymous
   war. The rest of the book is concerned with the discovery of the Newts,
   their exploitation and evolution, and growing tensions between humans
   and the Newts in the lead-up to the war.

   The book does not have any single protagonist, but instead looks at the
   development of the Newts from a broad societal perspective. At various
   points the narrator's register seems to slip into that of a journalist,
   historian or anthropologist. The three most central characters are
   Captain J. van Toch, the seaman who discovers the Newts; Mr Gussie H.
   Bondy, the industrialist who leads the development of the Newt
   industry; and Mr Povondra, Mr Bondy's doorman. They all reoccur
   throughout the book, but none can be said to drive the narrative in any
   significant way. All three are Czech.

   The novel is divided into three sections or 'books'.
