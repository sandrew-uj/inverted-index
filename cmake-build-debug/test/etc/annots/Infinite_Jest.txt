   In the novel's future world, the United States, Canada, and Mexico
   together compose a unified North American superstate known as the
   Organization of North American Nations, or O.N.A.N. (an allusion to
   onanism).

   Corporations are allowed the opportunity to bid for and purchase naming
   rights for each calendar year, replacing traditional numerical
   designations with ostensibly honorary monikers bearing corporate names.
   Although the narrative is fragmented and spans several "named" years,
   most of the story takes place during "The Year of the Depend Adult
   Undergarment" (Y.D.A.U.).

   On the orders of US President Johnny Gentle (a "clean freak" who
   campaigned on the platform of cleaning up the US while ensuring that no
   American would be caused any discomfort in the process), much of what
   used to be the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada has
   become a giant hazardous waste dump, an area "given" to Canada and
   known as the "Great Concavity" by Americans due to the resulting
   displacement of the border.
