   At the end of the previous series, Jenny Kelly was badly injured in the
   final struggle with Silverthorn for the Time Capsule, and must be taken
   to the year 3000, to be healed there. The story picks up a month after
   Jenny and Alana arrive back to the year 3000. The scientists soon
   realise that their time travel experiments have gone wrong and that
   they have altered the course of history. They must send Jenny and
   Silverthorn back to their respective times, in order to restore the
   timeline. Silverthorn, having faked remorse for his crimes, has
   surreptitiously stolen instructions for building the Time Gate. With
   Silverthorn and Jenny back in their own times, Alana and Lorien
   (Catherine McClements) return to the year 3000, only to discover that
   it is a radioactive wasteland: The Great Disaster has destroyed the
   Southern Hemisphere as well as the Northern Hemisphere. They go back to
   2500 and find that that era has not been altered, so they realise that
   it must be something Silverthorn does in 2500 that changes history and
   leads to The Great Disaster. In order to restore the timeline, Alana
   and Lorien must discover the cause of The Great Disaster, and prevent
   it.

   The year 2500 is a polluted, miserable dystopia, where GlobeCorp owns
   everything, and the majority of people live in relative squalor. Clean
   water and uncontaminated food are hard to come by, although the elite
   enjoy life in comfortable skyscrapers, and the top leaders live in a
   colony on the moon.

   With the help of Jenny and Nik, Alana must search for the cause of The
   Great Disaster, while evading capture by the GlobeCops and new villain
   Draco. They must also find a way to stop Silverthorn's plan to
   transport water from 1990 to the year 2500, which he does by using the
   Year 3000 information he has stolen to construct the Time Gate.
