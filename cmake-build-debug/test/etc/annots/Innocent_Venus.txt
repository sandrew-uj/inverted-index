   Main article: List of Innocent Venus characters

   In the near future, after the world population and economy is
   devastated by a series of simultaneous hypercanes, many different
   factions and fledgling nations appear. In Japan, an elite class called
   Logos appears, controlling special zones in the country which have
   most of the wealth and resources. These special zones were created with
   the help of Power Assist Technology, which allowed Japan to recover
   from the consequences of the worldwide disaster (which included a
   combination of land subsidence and rising sea levels resulting in the
   permanent submerging of low-lying areas and a subsequent ice age in
   much of the Northern Hemisphere), albeit to a strictly limited degree.
   The Logos exercise control over the Revenus, a lower class who
   mostly live in devastated and often poverty stricken zones (urban or in
   close proximity) and areas (rural) known as Levinas (e.g. Levinas
   Sector Six, Area 18) and who struggle from day to day in order to stay
   alive. The Revenus are generally restricted from entering the
   special zones, causing tension which creates a resistance movement
   which fights back against the Logos.

   With the tagline "A Near Future Late-Shogunate Action Animation", the
   story draws analogies with 19th-century Japan at the end of the
   Tokugawa Shogunate period, just before the Boshin War.

   The story proper is mainly set in 2035 AD. Jo and Jin defect from
   Phantom, an elite Japanese military special operations group which is
   used to help control the Revenus. When they escape, they take a young
   girl named Sana with them. The series follows them as they work to
   avoid being caught by Phantom and the regular military forces
   of the Logos. However, there are more to things than meet the eye.
