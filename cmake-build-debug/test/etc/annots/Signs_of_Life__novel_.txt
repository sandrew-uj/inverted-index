   Signs of Life is a novel by M. John Harrison published in 1997. The
   dystopian narrative centers on Mick "China" Rose, a biomedical
   transportation entrepreneur, and his lover Isobel Avens's dream of
   flying. The novel was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award
   in 1997,^[1] and for the British Fantasy Award the following year.^[2]

   Mick "China" Rose starts up a medical courier service with associate
   Choe Ashton, who's given to erratic behavior and gnomic utterances.
   Their first job is illegally to dump a load of hazardous medical waste.
   Meanwhile, waitress Isobel Avens, China's live-in lover, dreams,
   literally, of flying. But as his business expands, Isobel becomes
   increasingly unhappy, complaining that she can no longer fly in her
   dreams; soon she leaves China for rich doctor Brian Alexander (one of
   China's clients) and disappears into Brian's Miami clinic. In a rare
   moment of candor, Choe tells China about a transcendental experience he
   once had at beautiful Jumble Wood involving a green-eyed woman. Unable
   either to comprehend or repeat the experience, Choe makes an annual
   pilgrimage to the spot. Then Isobel telephones. Rejected by Brian,
   she's now almost constantly ill after mysterious--- and illegal---
   treatments in Miami. Slowly, horrifyingly, China watches as the
   treatments begin to take effect: Isobel grows feathers while her
   metabolism turns birdlike; but she still can't fly and attempts
   suicide. China takes her to Brian and demands help. Eventually, Isobel
   recovers, physically, but she can't, or won't, give up her dream, and
   China leaves her. Choe, meanwhile, now rich through an association with
   gangsters, has bought Jumble Wood and turned it into a toxic waste
   dump.
