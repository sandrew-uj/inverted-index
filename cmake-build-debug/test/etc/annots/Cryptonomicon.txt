   The action takes place in two periods--World War II and the late 1990s,
   during the Internet boom and Asian financial crisis.

   In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, a young United States Navy code
   breaker and mathematical genius, is assigned to the newly formed joint
   British and American Detachment 2702. This ultra-secret unit's role is
   to hide the fact that Allied intelligence has cracked the German Enigma
   code. The detachment stages events, often behind enemy lines, that
   provide alternative explanations for the Allied intelligence successes.
   United States Marine sergeant Bobby Shaftoe, a veteran of China and
   Guadalcanal, serves in unit 2702, carrying out Waterhouse's plans. At
   the same time, Japanese soldiers, including mining engineer Goto Dengo,
   a "friendly enemy" of Shaftoe's, are assigned to build a mysterious
   bunker in the mountains in the Philippines as part of what turns out to
   be a literal suicide mission.

   Circa 1997, Randy Waterhouse (Lawrence's grandson) joins his old
   role-playing game companion Avi Halaby in a new startup, providing
   Pinoy-grams (inexpensive, non-real-time video messages) to migrant
   Filipinos via new fiber-optic cables. The Epiphyte Corporation uses
   this income stream to fund the creation of a data haven in the nearby
   fictional Sultanate of Kinakuta. Vietnam veteran Doug Shaftoe, the son
   of Bobby Shaftoe, and his daughter Amy, do the undersea surveying for
   the cables and engineering work on the haven, which is overseen by Goto
   Furudenendu, heir-apparent to Goto Engineering. Complications arise as
   figures from the past reappear seeking gold or revenge.
