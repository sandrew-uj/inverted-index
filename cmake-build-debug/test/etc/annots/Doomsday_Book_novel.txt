   Kivrin Engle, a young historian specializing in medieval history, asks
   her reluctant instructor, Professor James Dunworthy, and the
   authorities running the project to send her to Oxford in 1320. This
   period had previously been thought too dangerous, because it stretched
   the time travel net 300 years earlier than it had ever been used
   before.

   Shortly after sending Kivrin to the 14th century, Badri Chaudhuri, the
   technician who set the time travel coordinates for the trip, collapses,
   an early victim of a deadly new influenza epidemic that disrupts the
   university and leads to the city being quarantined. Kivrin also falls
   ill as soon as she arrives in the past. She awakens, after several days
   of fever and delirium, at a nearby manor, whose residents have nursed
   her. Being moved by her rescuers causes her to lose track of the "drop
   point," the location where she arrives and must return at a prearranged
   time in order to get home.

   The narrative switches between Kivrin in the 14th century and 2054/2055
   Oxford during the influenza epidemic. Kivrin discovers many
   inconsistencies in what she "knows" about the time: the Middle English
   she learned is different from the local dialect, her maps are useless,
   her clothing is too fine, and she is far too clean. Kivrin fakes
   amnesia, afraid the background story she originally concocted would
   have inconsistencies, as she tries to find the drop point. Meanwhile,
   she becomes semi-integrated into society, bonding with the children
   Agnes and Rosemund. In the other timeline, Dunworthy tries to determine
   if Kivrin is safe as Oxford collapses into panic. He befriends his
   friend Mary's grand-nephew, Colin, and they become allies.

   In future Oxford, fears grow that the virus causing the epidemic has
   been transmitted from the past via the time travel net. This causes
   acting head of Balliol College Professor Gilchrist to order the net
   closed, effectively stranding Kivrin in the past.

   Kivrin and Dunworthy realize that she has arrived in England in 1348
   during the Black Death pandemic, more than 20 years later than
   intended. Because there's no slippage (the time shift between a
   traveler's intended and actual date of arrival, ensuring they can't
   change history), it's believed that Badri, delirious with illness,
   input the incorrect coordinates. It turns out that Badri contracted the
   influenza virus from human remains at the archaeological dig, when he
   had been helping there, starting the epidemic at future Oxford.

   The Black Death cuts a swathe through the Middle Ages, just as disease
   overwhelms the medical staff of the 21st century. Of those able to help
   Dunworthy, many die, including his friend Mary Ahrens, a doctor
   treating the infected who herself succumbs. Dunworthy himself is
   stricken by the disease but survives.

   Meanwhile, in the 14th century, two weeks after Kivrin's arrival, a
   monk infected with the plague comes to the village. Within days, many
   residents of the village fall ill. Kivrin's arranged retrieval date
   passes with neither side able to make it. At last, Dunworthy arranges
   for Badri to send him back in time to rescue Kivrin.

   In the Middle Ages, Kivrin can only watch while all the people she has
   come to know die from the Black Death. Dunworthy and Colin then find
   her. The three return to 21st century England shortly after New Year's
   Day, Colin excited by the concept of time travel, saying he will go to
   the Crusades when he is old enough.
