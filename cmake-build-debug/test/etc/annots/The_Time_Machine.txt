   The Time Machine was reprinted in Two Complete Science-Adventure Books
   in 1951

   The book's protagonist is a Victorian English scientist and gentleman
   inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, identified by a narrator simply as
   the Time Traveller. Similarly, with but one exception (a man named
   Filby), none of the dinner guests present are ever identified by name,
   but rather by profession (for example, "the Psychologist") or physical
   description (for example, "the Very Young Man").

   The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner
   guests that time is simply a fourth dimension and demonstrates a
   tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension. He
   reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person
   through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a
   remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.

   In the new narrative, the Time Traveller tests his device. At first he
   thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into
   the future. He continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn
   into a lush garden. The Time Traveller stops in A.D. 802,701, where he
   meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They
   live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly
   deteriorating buildings, and adhere to a fruit-based diet. His efforts
   to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or
   discipline. They appear happy and carefree but fear the dark, and
   particularly moonless nights. Observing them, he finds that they give
   no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances, possibly because
   the thought of it alone frightens them into silence. He speculates that
   they are a peaceful society. After exploring the area around the Eloi's
   residences, the Time Traveller reaches the top of a hill overlooking
   London. He concludes that the entire planet has become a garden, with
   little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of
   thousands of years prior.

   Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked
   to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has
   been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy
   doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he
   had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine
   being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark,
   he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who
   live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Exploring one
   of many "wells" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings, he discovers the
   machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi
   possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has
   evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the
   ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden working classes have become the
   brutal light-fearing Morlocks.

   Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the
   Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of
   sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their
   relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and
   ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result
   of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi,
   they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of
   humanity at its peak.

   Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named Weena from drowning as none of the
   other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an
   innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days.
   He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure dubbed
   "The Palace of Green Porcelain", which turns out to be a derelict
   museum. Here, the Time Traveller finds a fresh supply of matches and
   fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get
   back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because
   the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them,
   they stop in the forest for the night. They are then overcome by
   Morlocks in the night, whereby Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when
   a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches
   up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost
   in the fire and the Time Traveller is devastated over his loss.

   The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to
   capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape.
   He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly
   30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last
   living things on a dying Earth: Menacing reddish crab-like creatures
   slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies, in
   a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make
   jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and
   the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent
   and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.

   Overwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to his own time,
   arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left.
   He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the
   Time Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors,
   producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his
   pocket.

   The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to
   the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for
   another journey and promising to return in a short time. However, the
   narrator reveals that he has waited three years before writing and
   stating the Time Traveller has not returned from his journey.
