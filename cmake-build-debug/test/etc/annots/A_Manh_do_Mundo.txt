   "09/11 2001. And if anyone who has seen everything could, suddenly,
   wake up in time to prevent the tragedy?". This is a
   presupposition which, on the cover, this novel presents.

   At the core, this is a story of five persons, Thea, Mark Millard, Alice
   and Solomon, who jumped from the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. It
   is also the story of Ayda, who calls them cowards, and of her
   husband. Now "imagine that on September 13, the Universe resets
   the day 11 for some of them."
