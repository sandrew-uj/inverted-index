   By 2041, North America has been ravaged by "the great toxic gas scare
   of 1993": large swaths of land have been turned into inhospitable
   desert, where bands of raiders called "Centros" attack transports. The
   former United States have been assimilated into a Western bloc called
   the North Hemi. The opposing Eastern bloc is known as the Eastern
   Alliance, and the North Hemi is planning to salvage its economy by
   manufacturing defense robots called "mini-megs" for the Eastern
   Alliance. These robots would be half-sized offshoots of giant
   "mega-robots", once ubiquitous in warfare, but now reduced to a single
   specimen, the Mega-Robotic Assault System-2 (or MRAS-2, pronounced
   "Merras-2" for short in dialogue) which looks like a mechanized
   scorpion.

   MRAS-2 conducts tours for civilians, and carries laser assault weapons
   and a magnetic shield ("mag-shield" for short in dialogue) to defend
   itself. It is operated by captain Drake and his copilot Stumpy. During
   a transport run, MRAS-2 is ambushed by Centros. Drake opts for a
   defensive strategy, but his boss Rooney, Chief of Operation in Op Com,
   orders him to attack so he can show off the robot to general Wa-Lee and
   his aide Chou-Sing, visiting dignitaries from the Eastern Alliance sent
   to negotiate the purchase of the mini-meg series. The violent rocking
   motions of MRAS-2 during the battle cause an archaeologist passenger,
   Dr. Leda Fanning, to drop and break her valuable specimens. When Drake
   brings MRAS-2 to port, Leda angrily confronts Drake about the
   specimens, but he dismisses her with flirtatious remarks.

   Drake is summoned to Rooney's office, and shows him a recovered Centro
   weapon which appears to be of Eastern alliance origin. Drake deduces
   that the Eastern alliance is conspiring with the Centros, but Rooney
   disbelieves him. Drake pressures Rooney to stop the MRAS-2 tours to
   avoid risking more lives, and when his boss refuses, Drake vows to quit
   piloting the robot. Meanwhile, Leda has met with her journalist friend
   Annie, and exposes some suspicious activity going on in Crystal Vista,
   a perfectly preserved 20th-century town that was abandoned during the
   toxic gas scare: according to Leda, the town is built on a layer of
   "infasorb-8", a 21st-century material not invented when the town was
   abandoned, which is impenetrable to satellite imaging, and she has
   found components in an underground tunnel that are similar to those of
   the old MEGA-1 robot, which was supposedly dismantled.

   Later, Wa-Lee holds a traditional fighting ceremony. During a break in
   the fighting, Chou-Sing draws Wa-Lee's attention to Drake sitting in
   the audience. Wa-Lee invites Drake, who apparently has long-standing
   animosity against him, to fight. Drake initially declines, but Wa-Lee
   insists. Drake relents, and knocks Wa-Lee down before the battle begins
   proper, cementing the tension between them. Drake then makes good on
   his promise to Rooney and gives up pilot duty to volunteer for a
   special op against the Centros; there he recovers more Eastern
   Alliance-manufactured equipment. Despite Drake's insistence that the
   MRAS-2 is under threat from Centros, Rooney allows the tour to proceed
   with replacement pilot, captain Boles, piloting MRAS-2, and even has
   Wa-Lee taught how to pilot the robot as a courtesy. At a bar later on,
   Stumpy tells Drake that his grandfather was part of an effort to hide
   pieces of the MEGA-1 before the salvagers got to it; when Drake asks
   how one would hide a mega-robot, Stumpy says, "I guess you don't...
   they got caught." Meanwhile, Leda and Annie have ridden the MRAS-2 to
   Crystal Vista. There, they go underground through the basement of a
   schoolhouse, and find the micron transponders of the MEGA-1. Annie
   returns to catch the MRAS-2 return trip, while Leda stays behind to
   continue the investigation.

   Suddenly, Centros appear and chase Leda. She escapes for a while, and
   the rest of the Centros head for the Crystal Vista robot port. There,
   they join Wa-Lee's officers in a mutiny and kill the North Hemi
   security and captain Boles, proving Drake right about the Eastern
   Alliance's duplicity. Wa-Lee orders Chou-Sing to lock the passengers
   hostage in the MRAS-2 cabin and take control of Crystal Vista, while
   Wa-Lee hijacks MRAS-2 and attempts to destroy strategic targets,
   starting with the "toxic tomb", a pyramid-shaped structure used to
   store hazardous waste. Rooney pleads with Drake and Stumpy to retake
   the robot, and they agree upon learning that the Centros have captured
   Leda. Then Wa-Lee, upon hearing from his Centro allies that Drake has
   freed Leda and killed Chou-Sing, aborts his attack on the tomb and
   heads for Crystal Vista to kill Drake. To Wa-Lee's astonishment, he
   sees that Drake has found the MEGA-1 robot intact, reactivated it with
   Stumpy's expert help, and is now piloting it.

   The two robots meet in the desert and begin fighting. Drake removes the
   MRAS-2's cabin, saving the passengers, and eventually manages to
   severely damage MRAS-2 and subdue the general. The film ends happily as
   Drake and Leda admit their attraction to each other.
