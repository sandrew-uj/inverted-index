   Tara, a foundling, has been raised as the ward of Chanthu the sorcerer
   to be a War Maid, a member of an order of virgin swordswomen. At
   sixteen she is sent on a quest into the Twilight, a dim, dangerous and
   mysterious realm full of violence and magic, to discover the mystery of
   her origins. Her friend and protector Khaldur, a highly intelligent
   lion-like carnivore, accompanies her.

   Unfortunately for Tara (the goddess of her order being quite strict on
   the virginity requirement), the Twilight proves to be a hotbed of
   decadence and perversion. Her quest devolves a series of captivities
   and escapes, in which she is in turn separated from and reunited with
   her feline guardian. She is successively enslaved by lecherous
   inhabitants of the city of Paltossa, the Northern Barbarians, the
   sorceresses of the Witch Wood, and the sorcerer Sarkon and his three
   Womanthing minions.

   During the course of her adventures Tara picks up additional
   companions, including the bisexual girl Evalla, the Lion Warrior Thund,
   and the teenage boy Zorak, all of whom provide opportunities for sex
   play between adventures. Throughout all, she somehow manages to
   maintain a technical virginity, primarily because her various
   antagonists seem too depraved to consider ordinary intercourse, while
   her male companions are either too honorable, too inhibited, or too
   distracted by the bisexual Evalla.

   The novel ends with the quest unfinished, and the mysteries of Tara's
   heritage and destiny unresolved, with the travelers flying onward to
   new adventures in their magical air-gondola.
