   The Nome Trilogy, also known as The Bromeliad Trilogy, is a trilogy of
   children's books by British writer Terry Pratchett, consisting of the
   books Truckers (1989), Diggers (1990) and Wings (1990). The trilogy
   tells the story of the Nomes, a race of tiny people from another world
   who now live hidden among humans. Through the books they struggle to
   survive in the world and, once they learn of their history from an
   artefact known as "The Thing", make plans to return home.

   Diggers and Wings are contemporaneous sequels to Truckers, as each book
   follows different characters through mostly concurrent events. The
   central character throughout Truckers and Wings is Masklin, while in
   Diggers it is mainly Grimma.
