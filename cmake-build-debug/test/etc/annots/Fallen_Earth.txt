   The Fallen Earth story begins in the 21st Century, when the first in a
   series of natural disasters hits the United States. As Americans
   struggle to recover, an investment tycoon named Brenhauer buys a
   controlling stake in a mega-corporation named GlobalTech. By 2051, he
   moves his headquarters to the Grand Canyon Province, where GlobalTech
   eventually creates a self-sufficient economic and military mini-state.
   Meanwhile, in India and Pakistan, the Shiva virus, named for the
   dance-like convulsions that it caused in its victims, appears among the
   human populace. As the infection starts to spread, countries accuse
   each other of engineering the virus. Political paranoia turns to open
   aggression and nuclear conflict. The nuclear conflict combined with the
   virus devastates the planet. Less than one percent of Earth's
   population survived the Fall, and the Hoover Dam Garrison and Grand
   Canyon Province are the only known outposts of human civilization.
   Outside the protective confines of the Hoover Dam Garrison, the player
   encounters ruins of the old world, genetically altered creatures,
   strange technology, and six warring factions. Some factions seek to
   rebuild the old world, others wish to build a new one in their own
   image, and some simply desire chaos and anarchy.
