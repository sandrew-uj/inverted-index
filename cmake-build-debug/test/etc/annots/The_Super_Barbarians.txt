   For two generations humanity has been enslaved by the Vorra, a race of
   technologically advanced barbarians who had conquered space. On
   Qallavarra, the home planet of the Vorra, Gareth Shaw is an indentured
   servant of the House of Pwill, one of the giant city-states into which
   the planet is divided. As the only Terran on the estate, he is drawn
   into a seraglio intrigue by Under-lady Shavarri, the ninth wife of
   Pwill Himself, the overlord who rules the estate like a medieval duke.
   Shavarri's demand obliges Shaw to visit the "Acre of Earth", a
   ghetto-like enclave in the middle of a nearby city.

   In the Acre humans lived in relative freedom because they provided
   services that the Vorra could not provide for themselves. Chief among
   those services was the maintenance and repair of machines brought from
   Earth for the Vorra to use. But the Terrans also provided certain
   chemical services and Shaw had been sent to obtain one of those.

   Chased into the Acre by a Vorrish mob instigated by a squad of
   soldier-trainees, Shaw meets an almost equally hostile reception from
   three Terrans--Marijane Lee, her brother Ken, and their friend
   Gustav--who have rescued him from the mob. Seeing that he's wearing the
   livery of a Vorrish estate, they take him to Judge Olafsson, the voice
   of Terran law in the Acre. After being interrogated about his time on
   Qallavarra, Shaw leaves Judge Olafsson's court and completes his
   mission. He obtains from Hans Kramer, an apothecary, the love potion
   that Shavarri has ordered him to bring to her. Containing credulin, a
   drug that enhances suggestibility, the potion will enable Shavarri to
   manipulate Pwill Himself in her favor.

   Returning to the Pwill estate, he is called to the Grand Terrace of the
   manor house, where he finds Pwill Himself and his primary wife,
   Over-lady Llaq, having an angry confrontation with their wastrel son,
   Pwill Heir Apparent. Pwill, Sr. tells Shaw that his son has become
   addicted to a drug that affects the Vorra much as heroin affects
   Terrans--coffee--and that he expects Shaw to ensure that no one in the
   Acre will supply his son with more coffee. Later Pwill, Jr. prevails
   upon Shaw to keep him supplied with coffee beans through his friend
   Forrel.

   Soon after returning from the Acre and after his confrontation with
   Pwill Himself, Shaw begins to notice that he doesn't know things that
   he should know and that he knows things that, apparently, he shouldn't.
   He struggles to decode the meaning of that discovery and to regain lost
   memories, but has little success. After an encounter with the estate's
   whipmaster, he uses drugs obtained from Kramer to drive the whipmaster
   insane and thereby gains a reputation among the superstitious Vorra as
   a powerful shaman. One day he is taken to confront a rival shaman, who
   tells him that the Vorra acquired their hyperdrive-propelled starships
   and advanced weaponry by stealing them from another alien race. The
   shock of seeing the mummified remains of one of those aliens, still
   encased in a spacesuit, breaks a barrier in Shaw's mind and he begins
   to regain his lost memories, including why and how he lost his memories
   in the first place.

   On the same day that he regains his memories he is told by Marijane to
   cut off Pwill, Jr's coffee supply. Shaw agrees, knowing that Heir
   Apparent's display of withdrawal symptoms will throw the House of Pwill
   into crisis and put his life into jeopardy. But before anyone can
   notice his withdrawal symptoms, Pwill, Jr. comes to Shaw's room
   desperately seeking coffee and attacks Shaw. In self-defense Shaw kills
   the young man and hides the body in a sewer. Heir Apparent's
   disappearance precipitates the desired crisis and Shaw comes under
   suspicion of having provided the coffee that kept the young man
   addicted. The night before he is to be tortured to death, Shaw is
   extracted from the Pwill estate by Marijane, Ken, and Gustav and taken
   to the Acre.

   The next morning, convinced that his son has gone to the Acre in search
   of coffee, Pwill Himself leads four companies of his army toward the
   city, only to be ambushed by six companies of soldiers from the rival
   House of Shugurra. Soon thereafter the armies of ten other Houses join
   the battle and the Vorra are fully engaged in an all-out civil war,
   just as the Terrans had hoped.

   In the Acre all of the Terrans on Qallavarra climb to the rooftops and
   watch as a Vorra starship descends upon the city. The ship has been
   hijacked by a specially developed robot that had been hidden in a cargo
   container and now the ship will take all of the Terrans back to Earth.
   There the ship's technology can be copied for use against the Vorra in
   the general Terran revolt.

   Safe aboard the ship, Shaw sees the last piece of the puzzle fall into
   place in his mind. He realizes that the old shaman had lied to him
   about how the Vorra got their starships and advanced weaponry and he
   understands then that for the next century or so the Vorra will be the
   lesser of Earth's worries.
