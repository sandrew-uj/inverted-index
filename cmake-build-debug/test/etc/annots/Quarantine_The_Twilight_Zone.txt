   Matthew Foreman is awakened from cryogenic sleep by a woman named
   Sarah, who confirms he was suspended in June 2023 and the year is now
   2347. Sarah and two others use psychic abilities to take out the cause
   of the incurable disease that required him to be put into cryogenic
   sleep, without the use of instruments, anesthetic, or sterilization.
   Sarah explains that technology has been eliminated, and everyone now
   wields one of a number of specialized psychic abilities by tapping into
   a "biological gestalt." In 2043, a nuclear exchange wiped out 80% of
   the human population. The survivors pledged to never trust machines
   again. In the struggle to establish a society without technology, the
   human population dwindled to just 200,000. Every need in the agrarian
   post-apocalyptic community is met through genetic engineering and
   psionics, with computers replaced by monkeys who are voluntarily
   modified into immobile masses of tissue with oversized brains that
   telepathically transmit COLOQUEI NA SINCRONIA A IMAGEM.

   They have awoken Matthew because a meteor, sufficient to alter the
   entire ecosystem of Earth, is about to crash into the Indian
   subcontinent. His work with a satellite defense system can destroy the
   meteor. Despondent, Matthew believes because he does not share the
   gifts of the others in the village, he will never belong to their
   community. Sarah tells him they can perform surgery on his brain and
   give him the same abilities they have.

   Matthew operates a salvaged personal computer used by the commune to
   interface with the old satellite laser network. After the meteor makes
   a course correction upon reaching orbit, Matthew realizes it is not a
   meteor, but a United States spacecraft. The passengers are refugees of
   the war, returning 300 years later due to the relativity of time during
   space travel. Sarah and the others elected to kill them to prevent
   their contaminating society with technology, using their psychic powers
   to fool Matthew. Matthew attempts to stop the weapon. Sarah thwarts his
   efforts by removing a piece of equipment from the computer, and the
   ship is destroyed. Matthew is overcome by guilt at his part in the
   murder of thousands of people, and does not know his value to the
   community. Irene claims he is one of them now, and he begins his
   psychic journey.
