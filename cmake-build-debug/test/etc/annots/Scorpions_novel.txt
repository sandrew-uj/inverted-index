   Jamal is trying to get his brother, Randy, out of jail. Randy is a
   17-year-old who is the leader of the Scorpions, a local gang of drug
   dealers in New York City.

   Jamal's family includes himself, Randy, his mother, his 8-year-old
   sister whose name is Sassy, and his father, Jeovon Hicks. Jamal's
   father became an alcoholic after losing his job and began abusing
   Jamal's mother. She moves away with the children. Now Jamal's father
   comes to visit the family "once in a while".

   When the story begins, Randy only needs $500 to appeal his conviction.
   His mother is working to the bone in order to earn enough money to get
   the appeal for Randy. His mother soon finds out that his brother has
   been attacked and stabbed while in jail and is in medical care. Some
   members of the Scorpions want Jamal to join them until Randy is freed
   from jail so that there will be direct communication between the gang
   and Randy. Other members want to vote on a new leader because they feel
   Randy is dead to them and that letting a 12-year-old joining a gang
   would not be beneficial. Jamal wants to earn money the right way by
   working but is scared to go against the Scorpions. Eventually, Jamal
   breaks free from the bad influence and does the right thing.
