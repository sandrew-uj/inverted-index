   Set in 2040, the United States finds itself among a hostile world with
   only Britain, Russia, and Japan as reluctant allies. The dominant force
   in the world today is the United Nations, which has evolved into a
   world government and is challenging the US as the world's sole
   superpower, motivated for the "greater good." It has invaded Brazil
   because of Brazil's lack of care for the rainforest and it wants the US
   to give up part of the southwest America for a Hispanic nation known as
   Aztlan. The UN capital is located at Geneva, Switzerland.
