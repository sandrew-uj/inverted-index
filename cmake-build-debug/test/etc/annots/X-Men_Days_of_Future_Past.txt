   In a dystopian future, Sentinels have been programmed to identify and
   hunt down mutants and any humans who help them. In Moscow, they attack
   a small band of X-Men survivors consisting of Kitty Pryde, Colossus,
   Blink, Warpath, Bishop, Iceman and Sunspot, but Kitty sends Bishop's
   consciousness back in time a few days to warn the others as to ensure
   their survival.

   The group retreats to a remote Chinese temple where they meet with
   Storm, Wolverine, Professor Charles Xavier, and Magneto. Xavier
   explains the history of the Sentinels, which were designed by Bolivar
   Trask, a military scientist whom Raven Darkhoelme assassinated in 1973.
   In response, government forces captured Raven and experimented on her,
   using her DNA to advance the Sentinel program, allowing Sentinels to
   adapt to nearly every mutant power. Xavier plans to go back in time and
   prevent Trask's assassination in hopes of changing their future but
   since Xavier would not survive going back decades, Wolverine volunteers
   instead because his regenerative powers allow him to survive the
   process.

   Awakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine goes to the X-Mansion,
   learning from Hank McCoy that the school has been closed for years due
   to many students and staff being drafted into the Vietnam War, and
   Lehnsherr being falsely arrested for assassinating fellow mutant John
   F. Kennedy. A young, broken Xavier turned to alcoholism and frequently
   uses a specialized serum that allows him to walk but suppresses his
   telepathic abilities. Hoping to reunite with Mystique, Xavier agrees to
   help Wolverine. The trio infiltrate The Pentagon and break Lehnsherr
   out of prison, aided by the newly recruited Peter Maximoff.

   Raven discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants, and in
   revenge, she plots to assassinate him at the Paris Peace Accords, but
   Xavier, McCoy, and Logan foil her attempt. Lehnsherr attempts to kill
   Raven, believing this could prevent the Sentinel takeover. An alarmed
   McCoy fights him, allowing Raven to escape but publicly exposing the
   three as mutants. Trask takes advantage of this and successfully
   convinces President Richard Nixon to initialize the Sentinel program.

   Lehnsherr retrieves his helmet from military custody, using it to block
   Xavier's psychic powers, and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel
   prototypes by infusing them with metal. Returning to the X-Mansion,
   Xavier abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates
   with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship
   between mutants and humans. After Xavier uses his mutant-tracking
   computer Cerebro to find Mystique, he along with McCoy and Logan travel
   to Washington, D.C., to stop Raven's continuing plan to assassinate
   Trask.

   At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, the three search for
   the disguised Raven. Magneto appears, controlling the Sentinels, and
   barricades the White House within the outer structure of Robert F.
   Kennedy Memorial Stadium. During the battle, Magneto impales Logan with
   rebar and throws him into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and a
   disguised Raven retreat to the White House Bunker, but Magneto rips
   reinforcing steel bars out of the building with the intention of
   killing Nixon.

   In the future, the X-Men make their last stand as an onslaught of
   Sentinels attack them. Many mutants perish while attempting to buy more
   time, with Magneto being seriously injured. In 1973, Raven, openly
   showing herself as a mutant, subdues Magneto, saving Nixon and his
   cabinet. She goes to kill Trask but Xavier convinces Raven to spare
   him. As a mutant was publicly seen saving the president, the Sentinel
   program is decommissioned, altering history and erasing the future
   Sentinels from existence. The mutants in the past depart separately;
   Trask is later imprisoned for attempting to sell military secrets to
   Vietnamese military officials.

   Wolverine awakens at the school to find Iceman, Colossus, Kitty, Hank,
   Storm, Rogue, Jean Grey, Scott Summers and Xavier alive. Logan asks
   Xavier for information about modern history from 1973 to the present,
   and, realizing that the Wolverine from the original timeline has
   returned, the professor assents. Back in 1973, the younger Logan is
   rescued by Raven, who is disguised as Major William Stryker.

   In ancient Egypt, a crowd is seen chanting to En Sabah Nur, who
   telekinetically elevates building blocks to build pyramids, as four
   horsemen observe him from afar.
