   Harvey Swick is a 11-year-old boy bored with school, teachers,
   homework, and his day-to-day life. In response to Harvey's frustrated
   plea for change, a man named Rictus visits Harvey and tells him about a
   kid's paradise called the Holiday House. At the Holiday House, there
   are all the sweets a person could ask for, four seasons in a day,
   Halloween every evening, Christmas, with whatever gifts you could wish
   for every night, and everything else you could dream of. One week after
   his encounter with Rictus, Harvey hesitantly visits the house, entering
   through a wall of mist. Harvey stays at the Holiday House for 31 days,
   becoming friends with two other children staying alongside him, Wendell
   and Lulu. There is also a woman, Mrs. Griffin, who cooks all the meals
   for the children. She claims to have been there longer than anybody.
   And though she seems sweet, she appears to be keeping a secret about
   the house and its creator, Mr. Hood. Harvey eventually discovers that
   the house's creator, Mr. Hood, has sucked all of the children's souls
   away and turned them into fish, imprisoning them in the mysterious,
   dark, gloomy lake. Lulu is turned into a fish the night of Harvey's
   escape, but Harvey and Wendell still manage to flee the house by
   following a cat named Blue Cat through the mist barrier that constantly
   surrounds the property of the house at night.

   When both Harvey and Wendell come home, they soon discover that for
   every day they had spent in the Holiday House, one year had passed in
   the rest of the world. When Harvey meets his parents, he thinks he went
   to the wrong house, but he is wrong. His parents also realize who he is
   and invite him in. He takes a long nap and then tells them what
   happened. They go on the search of the House, but Harvey had forgotten
   all the roads he took coming home. They try all day, but Harvey and his
   parents can't find the house.

   Harvey's father finally decides to go to the police station. Harvey's
   mother decides to go out shopping and Harvey goes up to his room. When
   he is in his room, he sees Wendell in the street walking towards
   Harvey's house. Wendell tells Harvey that Wendell's mother is old, fat,
   and divorced. Harvey also tells Wendell what happened to him. They both
   think about what happened in the Holiday House and decide that the only
   way to regain their lost time is to return to the Holiday House. Upon
   doing so, Harvey learns that Hood runs the entire house on magic and
   illusions.

   Harvey defeats Hood by tricking him into using up all of his magic by
   wishing for as many things he can think of as fast as he can. With his
   power drained, an exhausted Hood allows Harvey one more wish. Harvey
   wishes for all the seasons at once, resulting in a furious lightning
   storm that burns down the house. Hood seems to perish in the fire, but
   he manages to rebuild a body from the debris of the house, and remarks
   at Harvey's courage. He contrasts Harvey with Wendell, who has
   succumbed to the House's lures and wishes to stay forever in a trance.
   Hood then offers Harvey, whom he calls "A Thief of Always," the chance
   to become a vampire with him and be immortal. Harvey refuses, and the
   confrontation ends with Mr. Hood being sucked into the lake, which has
   turned into a whirlpool. The children all leave the remains of the
   house to go back to their respective times.

       brown-eyed, and impulsive, is bored with his everyday life and
       wishes to go to a place that is a kids' paradise. His wish is
       granted when Rictus enters through the bedroom window and persuades
       him to come to this kids' paradise known as the Holiday House and
       agrees to come. When he arrives, Harvey becomes flabbergasted by
       the magic and wonders the Holiday House possessed. Harvey then
       discovers when he stays in the world of the Holiday House, all of
       the years of his life are stolen by Mr. Hood and he himself has
       realized that he has stolen the lives of children, including one of
       his friends Lulu, must put an end to all of the dark magic of Mr.
       Hood, destroy the House and all of its pitiful creatures that hide
       in its shadows. Harvey is bored and frustrated with his life in the
       first chapter, but he's very observant, smart, clever, and kind and
       does everything to help his friends and the children become free
       from the Holiday House and discovers in the end that there's
       nothing more powerful than the love of his family and friends and
       is the brightest child in the story.
     * Rictus - One of four servants of Hood's. Rictus is six inches
       taller than Harvey, wears gentlemen's clothes, a tall brim hat, and
       wears spectacles. He's very thin, has yellowish skin, and has a
       grin that can stretch wider than any grin, resembling the bizarre
       Cheshire Cat from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Rictus's name
       means "a fixed grimace or grin." Rictus' downfall occurs when Mr.
       Hood twists his head off due to being annoyed by Rictus.
     * Jive - One of four servants of Hood's. Jive's downfall occurs when
       he attempts to change Harvey's mind to stay at the Holiday House
       with pie and ice cream. Harvey tricks him by saying that the food's
       not real, but Jive unwillingly eats both plates of the pie and ice
       cream, which causes him to fall down and crawl on the stairs as he
       spews dirt and dust out of his mouth screaming for his master's
       help, and suddenly turns to a pile of dirt and dust. Jive's name
       means "deceitful or worthless."
     * Marr - One of four servants of Hood's. A grotesquely overweight
       female who is said to resemble a slug. Marr possesses the unique
       ability to manipulate human flesh into whichever shape she desires
       (similar to how one would mold clay). Marr's downfall occurs when
       Harvey forces her to see herself as the wretched slob that she is.
       Marr melts into a puddle of brackish, fleshy liquid. Marr's name is
       similar to the word "mar" which means to "impair the appearance of;
       disfigure."
     * Carna - One of four servants of Hood's. Carna's name could be
       alluding to the word "carnivore", which means "an animal that feeds
       on flesh." Carna is not a human. Carna's death occurs when Harvey
       pets its head and comforts it, ultimately being killed by kindness.
     * Wendell - A naive, obnoxious boy who loves to be in the Holiday
       House and becomes friends with Harvey. At some point in the book,
       he becomes obese due to the food in the house, and wants to stay in
       the house, but ultimately leaves when the house burns down.
     * Lulu - A girl about the same age as Harvey, who's been there longer
       than both he and Wendell. She has a room full of Christmas
       presents, as she has been there for months. She eventually has her
       soul taken by Mr. Hood.
     * Mrs. Griffin - The housekeeper, and a fantastic cook. She has been
       there longer than anyone and seems to know more than she lets on.
     * Mr. Hood - The owner of the Holiday House and is a part of the
       house.
     * The Holiday House - The place where every day is perfect, and

       careful.

       "has a good sense of direction" and helped Harvey and Wendell leave
