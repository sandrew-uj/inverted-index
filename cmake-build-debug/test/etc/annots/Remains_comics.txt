   On an invitation from president Shirley Wallace, every leading nations
   of the world came to an agreement of complete disarmament. But when a
   VIP guest's meddling son named Spaulding sneaks into the nuclear oven
   of Nevada and pressed a button he wasn't supposed to, humanity is
   literally doomed. The radiation turned the entire populace within the
   blast-radius into flesh-eating zombies.

   During the meltdown, outside Nevada, in Reno, Silver Star Hotel and
   Casino's Blackjack dealer Tom Bennett was busy screwing waitress Tori
   inside the vault. They came out with the realization that they are the
   only remaining persons that haven't been turned into zombies. But as
   their life in a post-apocalyptic period goes on, they realize they have
   even bigger threats to worry about.
