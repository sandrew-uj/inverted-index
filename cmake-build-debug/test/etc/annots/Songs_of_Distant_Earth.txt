   The novel is set in the early 3800s and takes place almost entirely on
   the faraway oceanic planet of Thalassa. Thalassa has a small human
   population sent there by way of an embryonic seed pod, one of many sent
   out from Earth in an attempt to continue the human race before the
   Earth was destroyed.

   The story begins with an introduction to the native Thalassans - the
   marine biologist Brant, his partner Mirissa and her brother Kumar. They
   are typical examples of the Thalassan culture; quiet, stable, and free
   from religion and supernatural influence. Their peaceful existence
   comes to an end with the arrival of the Magellan, an interstellar
   spaceship from Earth containing one million colonists who have been put
   into cryonic suspension.

   In a series of descriptive passages, the events leading up to the race
   to save the human species are explained. Scientists in the 1960s
   discover that the neutrino emissions from the Sun - a result of the
   nuclear reactions that fuel the star - are far diminished from expected
   levels. At a secret session of the International Astronomical Union it
   is confirmed that the problem is not with the scientific equipment: the
   Sun is calculated to become a nova around the year AD 3600.

   Over a period of centuries humanity develops advanced technologies to
   send out seeding ships containing human and other mammalian embryos
   (and later on, simply stored DNA sequences), along with robot parents,
   to planets that are considered habitable. One such ship is sent to the
   far off ocean world of Thalassa and successfully establishes a small
   human colony in the year 3109. Sending live humans is ruled out due to
   the immense amount of fuel that a rocket-propelled spacecraft would
   have to carry to first accelerate to the speeds required to travel such
   great distances within an acceptable time, and then decelerate upon
   approaching the destination. This limitation is overcome however with
   the development of the Quantum Drive less than a hundred years before
   the Sun is set to become a nova. This scientific break-through allows
   the construction of a fleet of manned interstellar vehicles, including
   the Starship Magellan. The Magellan escapes the Earth three years
   before the Sun explodes, an event that is witnessed by the Magellan's
   crew.

   In the intervening years the colony on Thalassa loses contact with
   Earth due to the destruction of its communication abilities by a
   volcanic eruption 400 years after its founding. The giant radio dish is
   never repaired due to an ingrained tendency to procrastinate, a trait
   common among the Thalassans. The Thalassans are therefore unaware of
   later developments on Earth, including manned interstellar travel. The
   Earth assumes the destruction of the colony as well.

   Two hundred and fifty years after the end of Earth the Magellan arrives
   at Thalassa, the midpoint of a 550-year voyage to colonise the distant
   ice planet Sagan 2. Primarily the objective is to replenish the ship's
   mammoth ice shield that had prevented micrometeors from damaging it
   during its interstellar journey. Thalassa is the obvious choice for
   this operation, as 95% of the planet's surface is covered by water.
   However, it soon becomes apparent that the human colony is still
   present and flourishing. Aboard are several crew members, awakened by
   the ship to undertake the mission, and 900,000 sleeping passengers.
   Among the crew is Loren Lorenson, a young engineer, and Moses Kaldor,
   an eminent and wise counsellor.

   The arrival of the visitors from Earth is a monumental event for the
   easygoing Thalassans, who never expected to see or hear from any other
   human beings. To the crew of the Magellan it is a welcome surprise to
   meet the natives and sample the pleasures of a beautiful and hospitable
   planet. A tale of love and tragedy starts to develop as Loren and
   Mirissa quickly fall in love, a situation that demonstrates the
   different level of social mores between the two cultures. The
   Thalassans appear free from monogamy and sexual possessiveness, a
   situation that the lonely and troubled crew quickly find out.

   Due to this and other aspects of the Thalassans' way of life, and the
   duration of the stay on the planet to repair the ship's ice shield, a
   small contingent of the crew quickly becomes disenchanted with the
   original objective of the mission, leading to a threat of mutiny.

   A more gentle and parental relationship also develops between Mirissa
   and Moses, a man deeply affected by the destruction of Earth and the
   loss of his wife. Moses soon provides Mirissa an insight into the
   culture and ways of Earth lost to the Thalassans, including the
   concepts of war and religion, concepts alien to the gentle Thalassans.

   During the course of the stay, and due to the construction of a massive
   plant for freezing the huge ice blocks for the shield, the Terrans and
   the Thalassans become aware of the existence of a potentially
   intelligent sea creature living in the depths of the Thalassan oceans.
   The "scorps" are similar to the sea scorpions of Earth, only much
   larger. It soon becomes evident that the scorps are responsible for the
   theft of metals and wire from several Thalassan underwater projects,
   including a fish trapping tool being developed by Brant. The
   intelligence of these creatures is questioned by most, but Moses
   believes they may have the potential for developing into a future
   intelligent species.

   Several unforeseen events occur that shatter the dream of idyllic life
   of Thalassa, and also remind the crew and the Thalassans that the
   visitors must soon continue their prime mission, and leave the
   Thalassans to their destiny.

   The story concludes with an air of tragedy and hope, as the
   relationship between Brant and Mirissa and Loren concludes; the
   transient nature and ultimate futility of their love revealed. Mirissa
   chooses to conceive a child by Loren, but a change in scheduling of the
   mission brought about by the threat of mutiny by the crew means he will
   never see his son. Brant accepts the child as his own.

   The dissatisfied elements of the crew are left on Thalassa while the
   rest leave on the last leg of their journey. Loren witnesses the life
   of Mirissa and his child after awakening on Sagan 2, three hundred
   years after their deaths.
