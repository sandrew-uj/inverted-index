   Geography of Neo-Tokyo (2019). Notice the amount of land reclaimed from
   Tokyo Bay.

   In 2019, following a world war, Neo-Tokyo is plagued by corruption,
   anti-government protests, terrorism, and gang violence. During a
   violent protest, the hot-headed Shotaro Kaneda leads his vigilante
   bosozoku gang, the Capsules, against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda's
   best friend Tetsuo Shima inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into
   Takashi, an esper who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid
   of a resistance organization. Assisted by fellow esper Masaru, Japan
   Self-Defense Forces Colonel Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes Tetsuo
   away, and arrests the Capsules. While being interrogated by the police,
   Kaneda meets Kei, an activist within the resistance movement, and
   tricks the authorities into releasing her and his gang.

   At a secret government facility, Shikishima and his head of research
   Doctor Onishi discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities
   similar to Akira, the esper responsible for the singularity that
   destroyed Tokyo in 1988. Esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of
   Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction, but the city's parliament dismisses
   Shikishima's concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to
   prevent another cataclysm. Meanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital,
   steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to run away from Neo-Tokyo
   with his girlfriend Kaori, but they are ambushed by the Clowns. The
   Capsules save Tetsuo and Kaori, but Tetsuo begins suffering intense
   headaches and hallucinations and is taken back to the hospital.

   After overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers,
   Kaneda joins Kei's resistance cell. At the hospital, the espers try to
   assassinate Tetsuo via hallucinations, but the attempt is thwarted. He
   then searches for them in a fit of rage, easily killing any orderlies
   and militiamen blocking his path. The resistance group infiltrates the
   hospital, and Kiyoko draws Kei and Kaneda into Shikishima and the
   espers' futile attempts to stop Tetsuo. Kiyoko tells Tetsuo that Akira,
   located in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium's construction
   site, could help Tetsuo with his powers. After rejecting everyone
   around him, especially Kaneda, Tetsuo escapes the hospital and hunts
   for Akira.

   Kei, used by Kiyoko as a medium to stop Tetsuo, breaks her and Kaneda
   out of military custody. Shikishima stages a coup d'etat against
   Neo-Tokyo's government and directs all of its military forces to
   destroy Tetsuo at any cost. At the Capsules' former hangout Harukiya
   Bar, Tetsuo confronts gangmates Yamagata and Kai over Kaneda's bike and
   kills Yamagata after his protest. Kai relays the news to Kaneda, who
   vows to avenge his friend, while Takashi brings Kei away. Tetsuo,
   mistaken for Akira by cultists, rampages through Neo-Tokyo, arriving at
   Akira's cryogenic storage dewar under the stadium. Kei fights Tetsuo,
   but he defeats her and exhumes Akira, only to find that his remains
   have been sealed in jars for scientific research.

   Kaneda duels Tetsuo with a laser rifle, and Shikishima fires an orbital
   weapon at him. While the latter destroys his arm, neither is able to
   stop him. Shikishima and Kaori approach the stadium, where Tetsuo, now
   with a robotic arm, is in great pain and losing control over his
   powers. Kaori attempts to restrain Tetsuo while Shikishima offers to
   return him to the hospital, heal his injuries, and help control his
   abilities. Kaneda arrives and continues his duel with Tetsuo who,
   weakened from the missing arm, mutates into a gigantic mass of flesh,
   engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass grows, Akira awakens to
   create a singularity, drawing Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension.
   After teleporting Shikishima to a safe distance, the espers agree to
   rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to
   Neo-Tokyo.

   In the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo and the espers'
   childhoods, including his and Tetsuo's friendship and the espers'
   psychic training before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda
   to Neo-Tokyo, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and
   that Kei is developing psychic powers. After witnessing the birth of a
   universe, Onishi's laboratory crushes him to death. After consuming
   most of Neo-Tokyo, the singularity disappears and water floods the
   crater left in its place. Kaneda, mourning the loss of Tetsuo,
   discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they ride off into the
   ruins while Shikishima watches the sunrise. Tetsuo humbly introduces
   himself at another unspecified plane of life and triggers the creation
   of a universe, transcending the limitations of human existence.
