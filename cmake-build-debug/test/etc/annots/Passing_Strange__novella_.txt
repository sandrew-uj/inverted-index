   In the present, lawyer Helen Young receives a terminal diagnosis. She
   retrieves a painting by a famous pulp magazine artist named Haskel and
   sells it to an unsavory collector named Marty. She leaves most of the
   money to charity, returns home, and commits suicide.

   In 1940s San Francisco, a group of queer women try to avoid America's
   anti-LGBT laws while living Bohemian lives. These women include Loretta
   Haskel, the aforementioned artist; Emily Netterfield, a cross-dressing
   singer; Franny Travers, a witch with the power of teleportation, and
   Helen Young. Haskel and Emily meet at Mona's 440 Club and establish a
   relationship. Haskel's estranged husband Len returns to the city,
   seeking money; Haskel spurns him and asks Helen to initiate divorce
   proceedings. One night, Emily and Haskel decide to go dancing. Emily
   dresses as a man so the couple can avoid suspicion. As they leave a
   performance hall, Len attacks them. Emily pushes Len into the street,
   where he is killed by a car. The police arrive, but Emily escapes using
   Franny's powers.

   Haskel uses a family heirloom to create a magical painting of the night
   in which she and Emily went dancing. They escape into the world of the
   painting, allowing them to avoid persecution and live happily as long
   as the painting exists. Helen, Franny, and their other friends agree
   that the last living member of the group will destroy the painting;
   Franny places it inside a booby-trapped box.

   In the present, Marty opens the sealed box, triggering the trap and
   destroying the fragile painting.
