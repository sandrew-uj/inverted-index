   The story starts in 1974 with the protagonist, Gregory Burgess,
   enrolled at the University of Waterloo in Canada. At the time, Greg is
   aimless, taking various liberal arts courses and doing just well enough
   not to get kicked out of school. Everything changes one day when his
   friends introduce him to the IBM System/360 mainframe and he becomes
   "hooked", changing his major to computer science. During this time, he
   also meets his on-again-off-again girlfriend, Linda, a minor recurring
   character.

   After reading a Scientific American article on game theory outlining
   how to teach matchboxes to play tic-tac-toe, he becomes interested
   in using artificial intelligence techniques to crack systems. After
   manually cracking the university's 360, he sets aside a portion of
   memory to experiment in, calling it "P-1", suitably cryptic so
   operators would not notice it. He then uses this area of memory as an
   experimental scratchpad to develop a program known as The System. The
   System follows any telecommunications links it can find to other
   computers, attempting to compromise them in the same way, and
   remembering failed attempts to tune future attacks. If successful, The
   System sets up another P-1 on that computer, and injects itself and
   everything it has learned so far into it.

   Greg runs The System on the 360/30 at Waterloo, but it fails and after
   it is detected he is expelled. Unwilling to simply drop it, he then
   rents time on commercial timesharing systems to improve the program,
   adding features to make it avoid detection so he won't get kicked off
   with the next failure. The command "rodtsasdt llllllreport*" typed into
   the command line returns current statistics on the number of systems
   infected and their total core memory. After several attempts, the
   program is finally successful, and realizing the system has succeeded
   and is beginning to spread, he injects a "killer" program to shut it
   down. It stops responding to him, so he considers the experiment
   successful and terminated.

   P-1's growth and education is chronicled. P-1 learns, adapts, and
   discovers telephone switching systems. These systems allow P-1 to grow
   larger and understand its vulnerabilities (power failures and humans).
   It learns it needs a way of maintaining itself over time. Through a
   series of interactions, P-1 discovers Pi-Delta, a triplexed 360/105 in
   a super secure facility capable of being self-sustaining for long
   periods of time, operated by the US Government. P-1 seeks to control
   Pi-Delta but, due to security protocols and process put in place, P-1
   is not able to take direct control of it. P-1 believes that having a
   system like Pi-Delta with more memory in such a secure facility is key
   to its long-term survival. Yet, P-1 knows that to obtain access to more
   memory in such a facility will require assistance of a human, someone
   like Gregory.

   The book then jumps forward three years to 1977, with Gregory now
   working for a commercial programming firm in the United States. His
   boss receives a message asking him to call Gregory to the operator
   terminal. Initially thinking it is another person using a chat program
   from a remote site, Greg soon realizes that it is in fact P-1, and
   types in the status command and is told that it has taken over almost
   every computer in the US (somewhat dated with 20,000 mainframes with a
   total of 5,800 MB), and is now fully sentient and able to converse
   fluently in English. P-1 explains that the basic ideas of looking for
   more resources and avoiding detection were similar enough to hunger and
   fear to bootstrap the AI, and when combined with enough computer
   storage in the form of compromised machines, it became self-aware.

   P-1 tells Greg that he has learned of a new type of experimental
   high-speed computer memory, "Crysto", that will dramatically improve
   his own capabilities. Not only is it faster than core, but it is also
   so large that the entire P-1 "networked" program could fit inside it.
   P-1 provides Greg grant money to work full-time on Crysto. Greg and
   Linda, now married to each other, set up a company to develop Crysto,
   enticing the original developer (Dr. Hundley) to join them in building
   a then-unimaginable 4GB unit.

   A Navy Criminal Investigation Division agent, Burke, assigned to
   investigate the penetration of Pi-Delta, a top secret global battle
   simulator and cryptography computer, figures out the intruder is a
   program and finds Gregory. Under threat of arrest and imprisonment,
   Gregory and Dr. Hundley go to the Pi-Delta facility and persuade P-1 to
   act as a security monitor for the complex. P-1 compiles detailed and
   accurate personality profiles of all the people it interacts with and
   decides that Burke is ultimately dangerous. A flight control computer
   screen is altered so that the operator gives bad flight commands.
   Burke's plane plunges into the ground.

   The US military decides that P-1 is flaky and unstable and attacks the
   building. P-1 attempts to "spirit away" over microwave links, but this
   is discovered and the antennas destroyed. An assault on the underground
   facility follows, which P-1 initially attempts to block by exploding
   devices planted around the building for self-defense against precisely
   this sort of assault. P-1 is eventually convinced to allow the assault
   to succeed to avoid loss of life. As soon as they enter the computer
   room, the soldiers start setting up explosives to destroy P-1, and
   Gregory is killed when he attempts to prevent this. Upset that Gregory
   is killed, P-1 detonates the remaining explosives in the building,
   destroying everything.

   Months later, Linda visits the Waterloo computer lab, and sadly types
   "p 1" on a terminal. She starts to leave when the terminal clatters and
   she sees printed "oolcay itay" (Pig Latin for "cool it").
