   Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen are sisters living in The Midlands in
   England in the 1910s. Ursula is a schoolteacher, Gudrun a painter. They
   meet two men who live nearby, school inspector Rupert Birkin and Gerald
   Crich, heir to a coal-mine, and the four become friends. Ursula and
   Birkin begin a romantic friendship, while Gudrun and Gerald eventually
   begin a love affair.

   All four are deeply concerned with questions of society, politics, and
   the relationship between men and women. At a party at Shortlands, the
   Criches' country manor home, Gerald's sister Diana drowns. Gudrun
   becomes the teacher and mentor of Gerald's youngest sister. Soon,
   Gerald's coal-mine-owning father dies as well, after a long illness.
   After the funeral, Gerald goes to Gudrun's house and spends the night
   with her while her parents sleep in another room.

   Birkin asks Ursula to marry him, and she agrees. Gerald and Gudrun's
   relationship, however, becomes stormy.

   The two couples take a holiday together in the Alps. Gudrun begins an
   intense friendship with Loerke, a physically puny but emotionally
   commanding artist from Dresden. Gerald, enraged by Loerke and most of
   all by Gudrun's verbal abuse and rejection of his manhood, and driven
   by his own internal violence, tries to strangle Gudrun. Before he has
   killed her, however, he realises that this is not what he wants, and he
   leaves Gudrun and Loerke, and climbs the mountain, eventually slipping
   into a snowy valley where he falls asleep and freezes to death.

   The impact of Gerald's death upon Birkin is profound. The novel ends a
   few weeks after Gerald's death, with Birkin trying to explain to Ursula
   that he needs Gerald as he needs her; her for the perfect relationship
   with a woman, and Gerald for the perfect relationship with a man.
