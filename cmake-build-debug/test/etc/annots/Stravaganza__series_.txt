   Stravaganza is a series of novels written by children's author Mary
   Hoffman. The books are set alternatively between Islington, an area of
   London, England, and various cities in Talia, an alternate version of
   Renaissance Italy.

   The series originally consisted of a trilogy of books: City of Masks,
   City of Stars, and City of Flowers. The popularity of the trilogy
   allowed the series to be extended for three more books: City of
   Secrets, City of Ships, and City of Swords.
