   Li RM35M4419, nicknamed "Chip" (as in "chip off the old block") by his
   nonconformist grandfather Jan, is a typical child Member, but through a
   mistake in genetic programming, he has one green eye. Through his
   grandfather's encouragement, he learns how to play a game of "wanting
   things," including imagining what career he might pick if he had the
   choice. Chip is told by his adviser that "deciding" and "picking" are
   manifestations of selfishness, and he tries to forget his dreams.

   As Chip grows up and begins his career, he is mostly a good citizen but
   commits minor subversive acts, such as procuring art materials for
   another "nonconformist" member who was denied them. His occasional
   oddities attract the attention of a secret group of Members of
   nonconformists, like Chip. There, he meets King, a Medicenter chief who
   obtains members' records for potential future recruitment to the group;
   King's beautiful girlfriend, Lilac, a strong-willed and inquisitive
   woman with unusually-dark skin; and Snowflake, a rare albino member.
   They teach Chip how to get his treatments reduced so that he can feel
   more and stronger emotions. Chip begins an affair with Snowflake but is
   really attracted to Lilac.

   Chip and Lilac begin to search through old museum maps and soon
   discover islands around the world that have disappeared from their
   modern map. They begin to wonder if perhaps other "incurable" members
   have escaped to the islands. King tells them that the idea is nonsense,
   but Chip soon learns that King has already interacted with some
   "incurables" and that they are indeed real. Before he can tell Lilac,
   Chip's ruse is discovered by his adviser. He and all the other members
   of the group are captured and treated back into docility (except King,
   who takes his own life before he can be captured).

   Some years later, Chip's regular treatment is delayed by an earthquake.
   In the meanwhile, he begins to "wake up" again and remembers Lilac and
   the islands. He is able to shield his arm from the treatment nozzle and
   becomes fully awake for the first time. He locates Lilac again and
   kidnaps her. At first, she fights him, but as she too becomes more
   "awake," she remembers the islands and comes willingly. In the process,
   she is raped by Chip. Finding a convenient abandoned boat on the beach,
   they head for the nearest island of incurables, Majorca. There, they
   learn that UniComp, as a last resort, has planted failsafes that
   eventually lead all incurables to the islands, where they will be
   trapped forever from the treated population. After living "free" on
   Majorca, Chip and Lilac eventually marry and have a child together.

   Chip conceives of a plan to destroy the computer, UniComp, by blowing
   up its refrigeration system. He recruits other incurables to join him,
   and they make their way to the mainland. Just as they reach UniComp,
   one of the incurables, an agent of the programmers, betrays his
   partners and leads the rest of the group at gunpoint to a secret
   luxurious underground city beneath UniComp, where they are met by Wei,
   one of the original planners of the Unification. Wei and the other
   "programmers" live in UniComp have arranged the test so that the most
   daring and resourceful incurables will make their way to UniComp.
   There, they too will live in luxury as programmers.

   After joining the programmers and a few tentative attempts to confide
   in someone, Chip shares his misgivings with no one, lies low, and
   dedicates himself to the task of gaining Wei's confidence. For example,
   to deceive Wei, Chip consents to the replacement of his green eye with
   a brown one even though it involves giving up a cherished part of his
   identity.

   However, nine months later, a new group of incurables arrives, and Chip
   leaves the welcome party with the intention of using the newcomers'
   explosives to blow up the master computer. A physical struggle with
   Wei, who has the body of a young athlete, results in Wei being shot.
   Just before he is killed, Wei reveals his true motive in creating the
   dystopia: "there's joy in having it, in controlling, in being the only
   one." Chip knew all along that it was power hunger, not altruism, that
   drove Wei to chicanery and murder. On his way up from the underground
   city towards sunlight, Chip tells an angry programmer: "'There's joy in
   having it': those were [Wei's] last words. Everything else was
   rationalization. And self-deception."

   The book ends with Chip riding a helicopter toward Majorca, where his
   wife, son, financial sponsors, and friends are hopefully waiting for
   him. For the first time in his life, he sees raindrops in daytime,
   nature's affirmation that the era of slavery and total control is
   finally over.
