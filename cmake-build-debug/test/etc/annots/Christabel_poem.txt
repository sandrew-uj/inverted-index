   "So halfway from her bed she rose,
   And on her elbow did recline
   to look at the Lady Geraldine."
   from The Blue Fairy Book (1891), ed. Andrew Lang; illus. H. J. Ford and
   Lancelot Speed. London, Longmans, Green and Co.

   The story of Christabel concerns a central female character of the same
   name and her encounter with a stranger called Geraldine, who claims to
   have been abducted from her home by a band of rough men.

   Christabel goes into the woods to pray by the large oak tree, where she
   hears a strange noise. Upon looking behind the tree, she finds
   Geraldine who says that she had been abducted from her home by men on
   horseback. Christabel pities her and takes her home with her. However,
   supernatural signs (a dog angrily moaning despite being asleep, fading
   flames on torches suddenly reigniting, Geraldine being unable to cross
   an iron gate, denial of prayer) seem to indicate that all is not well.
   They spend the night together, but while Geraldine undresses, she shows
   a terrible but undefined mark: "Behold! her bosom and half her side-- /
   A sight to dream of, not to tell! / And she is to sleep by Christabel"
   (246-48).

   Christabel's father, Sir Leoline, becomes enthralled with Geraldine and
   orders a grand procession to announce her rescue. He ignores the weak
   objections of his daughter, who, although under enchantment, is
   starting to realize the enormity of Geraldine's malign nature. The
   unfinished poem ends here.

   (Note: Geraldine and Leoline's names are pronounced to rhyme with
   "recline.")
