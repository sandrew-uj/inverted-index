   The novel is set in rural England in the early 19th century. Mrs.
   Bennet attempts to persuade Mr. Bennet to visit Mr. Bingley, a rich
   bachelor recently arrived in the neighbourhood. After some verbal
   sparring with her husband, Mrs. Bennet believes he will not call on Mr.
   Bingley. Shortly afterwards, he visits Netherfield, Mr. Bingley's
   rented residence, much to Mrs. Bennet's delight. The visit is followed
   by an invitation to a ball at the local assembly rooms that the entire
   neighbourhood will attend.

   At the ball, we are first introduced to the whole Netherfield party,
   which consists of Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of one of
   his sisters, and Mr. Darcy, his dearest friend. Mr. Bingley's friendly
   and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears
   attracted to Jane Bennet (the Bennets' eldest daughter), with whom he
   dances twice. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy, is haughty and
   aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance with
   Elizabeth (the Bennets' second-eldest daughter), stating that she is
   not attractive enough to tempt him. Elizabeth finds this amusing
   and jokes about it with her friends.

   Mr. Bingley's sisters, Caroline and Louisa, later invite Jane to
   Netherfield for dinner. On her way there, Jane is caught in a rain
   shower and develops a bad cold, forcing her to stay at Netherfield to
   recuperate, much to Mrs. Bennet's delight. When Elizabeth goes to see
   Jane, Mr. Darcy finds himself getting attracted to Elizabeth (stating
   she has "fine eyes"), while Miss Bingley grows jealous, as she herself
   has designs on Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth herself is indifferent and unaware
   of his developing interest in her.

   he never reads novels

   Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennet's cousin and the heir to the Longbourn estate,
   visits the Bennet family. He is a pompous, obsequious clergyman who
   intends to marry one of the Bennet girls. After learning that Jane may
   soon be engaged, he quickly decides on Elizabeth, the next daughter in
   both age and beauty.

   Elizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming army officer,
   George Wickham, who singles out Elizabeth. He says he is connected to
   the Darcy family and claims Mr. Darcy deprived him of a "living" (a
   permanent position as a clergyman in a prosperous parish with good
   revenue) promised to him by Mr. Darcy's late father. Elizabeth's
   dislike of Mr. Darcy is confirmed.

   At the ball at Netherfield, Mr. Darcy asks Elizabeth to dance, and,
   despite her vow never to dance with him, she accepts. Excluding Jane
   and Elizabeth, Elizabeth's mother and younger sisters display a
   distinct lack of decorum. Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she fully
   expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged, and the younger Bennet
   sisters expose the family to ridicule by their silliness.

   Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth. Her father informs her that if she
   doesn't marry Mr. Collins, her mother will never speak to her again,
   but if she does marry Mr. Collins, her father will never speak to her
   again. She rejects Collins, to her mother's fury and her father's
   relief. Shortly afterward, the Bingleys suddenly depart for London with
   no plans to return. After Elizabeth's rejection, Mr. Collins proposes
   to Charlotte Lucas, a sensible young woman and Elizabeth's friend.
   Charlotte is grateful for a proposal that guarantees her a comfortable
   home and a secure future. Elizabeth is aghast at such pragmatism in
   matters of love. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and
   Uncle Gardiner in London. It appears that Mr. Bingley has no intention
   of resuming their acquaintance.

   In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent.
   Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, the imposing home
   of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, imperious patroness of Mr. Collins and Mr.
   Darcy's wealthy aunt. Lady Catherine expects Mr. Darcy to marry her
   daughter, as planned in his childhood by his aunt and mother. Mr. Darcy
   and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park.
   Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend,
   presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that
   the prevented engagement was to Jane and is horrified that Mr. Darcy
   interfered. Later, Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love
   for her despite her low social connections. She rejects him angrily,
   stating she could never love a man who caused her sister such
   unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr.
   Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and
   suggests that he had been kinder to Bingley than to himself. He
   dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham sarcastically but does not
   address it. Elizabeth states firmly that he is the last person she
   would ever marry.

   Later, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that Wickham, the
   son of his late father's steward, had refused the living his father had
   arranged for him and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly
   squandered the money and when impoverished, asked for the living again.
   After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister,
   Georgiana, for her considerable dowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he
   separated Jane and Bingley due to Jane's reserved behaviour, sincerely
   believing her indifferent to Bingley, and also because of the lack of
   propriety displayed by some members of her family. Elizabeth is ashamed
   by her family's behaviour and her own lack of better judgement that
   resulted in blinded prejudice against Mr. Darcy.
   Elizabeth tells her father that Darcy was responsible for uniting Lydia
   and Wickham, one of the two earliest illustrations of Pride and
   Prejudice. The clothing styles reflect the time the illustration
   was engraved (the 1830s), not the time in which the novel was written
   or set.

   Some months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour of
   Derbyshire. They visit Pemberley, the Darcy estate (after Elizabeth
   ascertains Mr. Darcy's absence). The housekeeper there describes Mr.
   Darcy as kind and generous, recounting several examples of these
   characteristics. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly
   gracious and later invites Elizabeth and the Gardiners to meet his
   sister, and Mr. Gardiner to go fishing. Elizabeth is surprised and
   delighted by their treatment. Upon meeting, Elizabeth and his sister
   connect well, to his delight. She then receives news that her sister
   Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy immediately, then
   departs in haste, believing she will never see him again as Lydia has
   ruined the family's good name.

   After an immensely agonizing interim, Wickham has agreed to marry
   Lydia. With some veneer of decency restored, Lydia visits the family
   and tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her and Wickham's wedding.
   Though Mr. Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner
   now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at
   great expense and trouble to himself. She hints that he may have had
   "another motive" for having done so, implying that she believes Darcy
   to be in love with Elizabeth.

   Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Bingley proposes to
   Jane, who accepts. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth
   intends to marry Mr. Darcy, visits Elizabeth and demands she promise
   never to accept Mr. Darcy's proposal. Elizabeth refuses and the
   outraged Lady Catherine withdraws after Elizabeth demands she leave for
   making insulting comments about her family. Darcy, heartened by his
   aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to
   her and is accepted. Elizabeth has difficulty in convincing her father
   that she is marrying for love, not position and wealth, but Mr. Bennet
   is finally convinced. Mrs. Bennet is exceedingly happy to learn of her
   daughter's match to Mr. Darcy and quickly changes her opinion of him.
   The novel concludes with an overview of the marriages of the three
   daughters and the great satisfaction of both parents at the fine, happy
   matches made by Jane and Elizabeth.
