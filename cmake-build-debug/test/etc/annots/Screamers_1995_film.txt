   In the year 2078, the planet Sirius 6B, once a thriving mining hub, has
   been reduced to a toxic wasteland by a war between the mining company,
   known as the New Economic Block (N.E.B.), and "The Alliance," a group
   of former mining and science personnel. After miners discovered that
   their extraction of ore released toxic gases, they went on strike, and
   the mining company hired mercenaries as strike breakers. Five years
   into the war, Alliance scientists created and deployed Autonomous
   Mobile Swords (AMS) -- artificially intelligent self-replicating
   machines that hunt down and kill N.E.B. soldiers on their own. They are
   nicknamed "screamers" because of a high-pitched noise they emit as they
   attack. Screamers track targets by their heartbeats, so Alliance
   soldiers wear "tabs" which broadcast a signal canceling out the
   wearer's heartbeat and rendering them "invisible" to the machines.

   A fragile stalemate is in effect between the two exhausted, poorly
   supplied, and undermanned armies. The Alliance recovers a message from
   a dead N.E.B. soldier, killed by screamers as he approached the
   Alliance compound, guaranteeing safe passage through N.E.B. territory
   to discuss a truce. When Alliance commanding officer Joe Hendricksson
   reports this development to his Earth-based superiors, he is told that
   peace negotiations are already underway on Earth; but Private "Ace"
   Jefferson, newly arrived from Earth, says that is untrue. Hendricksson
   is not surprised; he has long suspected that both sides have simply
   written off Sirius 6B and abandoned their armies.

   Hendricksson decides that the only realistic chance of survival for
   himself and his soldiers is to accept the N.E.B. truce offer. He sets
   out for a meeting with the N.E.B. commander, accompanied by Jefferson.
   While traveling through a destroyed city they come upon a war orphan, a
   young boy named David, clutching a teddy bear. Unwilling to abandon a
   defenseless civilian, they bring the boy along. The following night
   they are attacked by a reptilian screamer that they have never before
   encountered. Hendricksson is alarmed that their Alliance tabs did not
   protect them.

   As the group nears the N.E.B. compound, two enemy soldiers, Becker and
   Ross, open fire on David, whose chest explodes in a shower of gears,
   bolts, and wires. They explain to the astonished Alliance men that
   David was a new "type 3" screamer impersonating a human. Most of the
   N.E.B. contingent has been wiped out by another "David" screamer that a
   patrol unwittingly brought into the base; Becker, Ross, and a black
   marketeer named Jessica are the only survivors.

   The group heads to the N.E.B. command center but finds only an empty
   building and large pools of blood. Locating the mainframe computer,
   Hendricksson learns that the N.E.B. truce offer was just as false as
   the Alliance message from Earth. The group retreats to the N.E.B.
   bunker, pursued by "Davids". The discovery that the screamers have
   "evolved" new versions on their own that are indistinguishable from
   humans, and immune to Alliance tabs, leads to paranoia and distrust.
   Becker becomes convinced that Ross is a screamer and kills him, only to
   discover that he was human. The four survivors retreat to the Alliance
   base, only to find that the "Davids" have gained entrance to that
   compound as well, with equally devastating results. As dozens of
   "Davids" pour out of the bunker's entrance, Hendricksson fires a
   micro-nuclear missile into the bunker. Jefferson rushes to the aid of
   Becker, who was apparently injured in the blast, but Becker's cries of
   distress are a ruse; he is a "type 2" screamer, and he kills Jefferson.
   After Hendricksson destroys Becker, only he and Jessica remain.

   Now paranoid, Hendricksson worries that Jessica could be a screamer as
   well. He slashes her hand, and is relieved to see blood dripping from
   the wound. They locate an emergency escape shuttle. As they prep it for
   launch, they are attacked by another "Becker" that Hendricksson
   destroys. With the shuttle now prepped, they discover it can carry only
   one person. Hendricksson offers the shuttle to Jessica; but a second
   "Jessica" arrives, confirming that she is a screamer after all, and
   even more human-like. Hendricksson resigns himself to death; but to his
   surprise, Jessica shields him, then sacrifices herself in battle with
   her lookalike. With her last breath, Jessica confesses her love for
   Hendricksson.

   Hendricksson departs for Earth on the escape shuttle with a single
   souvenir, the teddy bear carried by the original "David". As the screen
   fades to black, the bear slowly begins to move on its own.
