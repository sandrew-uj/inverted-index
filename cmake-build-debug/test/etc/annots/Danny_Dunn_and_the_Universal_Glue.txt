   Professor Bullfinch develops a glue which is stronger than any known
   glue. He christens it Irenium in honor of Danny's friend and neighbor
   Irene.

   The Blaze Chemical Company, which built a factory after draining a
   swamp, has leaked a chemical into the water which may cause the local
   dam to break. Danny, Joe and Irene use a can of Irenium to patch up the
   dam.

   In a subplot, Danny also uses the glue as a form of protest against Mr.
   Blaze by placing it on the backseat of his vehicle, causing Mr. Blaze
   to be stuck to the seat and having to cut his trousers apart, resulting
   in a humorous event where an angered Mr. Blaze appears at a town
   meeting to voice concerns over his chemical company wearing a blanket
   over his legs, giving the appearance of a kilt.

   Danny's mother, Mrs. Dunn, who originally protested the draining of the
   swamp, gives Danny a stern rebuke that the prank was immature and
   counterproductive, and that Danny is now required to make restitution,
   meaning he is now in debt to Mr. Blaze to pay for a new pair of men's
   trousers. Danny humbly sends a letter to Mr. Blaze with all the cash he
   has on hand, apologizing for what he did with the promise to work out a
   payment plan.

   During Danny's birthday party, a surprise guest is Mr. Blaze, who
   commends Danny for saving the town's dam and that his company will now
   have tougher oversight on chemical waste. He returns Danny his money,
   saying, "I guess a pair of pants was worth the lesson."
