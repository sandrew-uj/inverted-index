   The novel centers on three character groups: that of Hockenberry (a
   resurrected twentieth-century Homeric scholar whose duty is to compare
   the events of the Iliad to the reenacted events of the Trojan War),
   Greek and Trojan warriors, and Greek gods from the Iliad; Daeman,
   Harman, Ada, and other humans of an Earth thousands of years after the
   twentieth century; and the "moravec" robots (named for scientist and
   futurist Hans Moravec) Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io, also
   thousands of years in the future, but originating in the Jovian system.
   The novel is written in first-person, present-tense when centered on
   Hockenberry's character, but features third-person, past-tense
   narrative in all other instances. Much like Simmons' Hyperion, where
   the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters'
   stories are told over the course of the novel and begin to converge as
   the climax nears.
