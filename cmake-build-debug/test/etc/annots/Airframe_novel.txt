   The novel opens aboard Hong Kong-based TransPacific Airlines Flight
   545, a Norton Aircraft-manufactured N-22 wide-body aircraft, flying
   from Hong Kong to Denver. An incident occurs on board the plane about
   1/2 hour west of the California coast, and the pilot requests an
   emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport, stating that
   the plane encountered "severe turbulence" in flight. The pilot gives
   air traffic control conflicting information regarding the types and
   severity of injuries, but does inform them that crew members are hurt
   and "two passengers are dead."

   The incident seems inexplicable. The N-22 is a plane with an excellent
   safety record, and the captain, John Zhen Chang, is highly skilled,
   making the possibility of human error unlikely. Passengers and flight
   crew give almost identical accounts of the circumstances of the
   disaster, and the most likely explanation turns out to be a technical
   problem that was thought to have been fixed years before. As Vice
   President of Quality Assurance at Norton Aircraft, it is Casey
   Singleton's job to try to protect the design's (and Norton's)
   reputation, especially since it jeopardizes a crucial aircraft purchase
   deal with China. However, not only does she have to deal with a
   ratings-hungry media intent on assigning blame for the incident, she
   must also deal with Bob Richman, an arrogant and suspicious Norton
   family member assigned to assist her. All the while, she has to
   navigate the murky politics of the factory union and try and soothe the
   tempers of disgruntled Norton workers who fear the fallout from the
   incident will bankrupt the company and cost them their jobs.

   When the company's Incident Review Team begins to investigate, they
   discover that the plane's Flight Data Recorder (FDR) had malfunctioned
   prior to the accident, and thus the data on any system errors or pilot
   control inputs is corrupted. Because Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVRs) are
   not allowed to store longer recordings due to Federal Aviation
   Administration restrictions, the CVR data from the time of the
   accident has also been lost. Without FDR and CVR data, the team is
   forced to go over every part and circuit of the aircraft to look for
   what might have caused the accident. At first, all signs point to a
   malfunction of the plane's slats having caused them to deploy
   mid-flight. Though other N-22s had exhibited similar slats errors in
   the past, they were thought to have been caused by pilots inadvertently
   snagging the control lever. Norton assumed that the slats problem had
   been fixed by its subsequent Airworthiness Directives (ADs) locking the
   lever into place and covering it when not in use. The team is anxious
   to prove that this was not the cause of the accident, because a slats
   malfunction despite both ADs' being fully implemented points to an
   underlying error that could make the N-22 unsafe to fly. Their search
   eventually uncovers a counterfeit part likely installed by a careless
   maintenance worker, but this would not have been enough to cause the
   accident on its own.

   Upon reviewing the plane's raw fault data printouts, Casey realizes
   that the plane was equipped with a Quick Access Recorder (QAR). A QAR
   provides even more detailed flight data than the FDR, but the team did
   not know the plane was equipped with one because QARs are optional.
   Casey locates the QAR on board the N-22, and she is able to piece
   together the events that caused the accident from the data it recorded.

   Contrary to public belief, the accident was caused not by a design flaw
   at Norton, but by an accident cascade stemming from poor maintenance
   practices at Transpacific Airlines and from pilot error. First, the
   counterfeit part caused a sensor in the plane's wing to malfunction,
   which produced an error message in the cockpit. This error message
   could be cleared by deploying and retracting the plane's slats.
   Although deploying the slats would change the shape of the wing, the
   N-22's autopilot was capable of making the necessary adjustments
   without incident. However, the pilot at the time of the accident
   manually overcorrected, overriding the autopilot and sending the plane
   into a series of oscillations that resulted in fatalities. Originally,
   this had been ruled out as a possible cause because the plane's
   captain, who was reportedly at the controls during the accident, was a
   highly capable pilot with ample experience flying the N-22. However,
   Casey noticed that Chang's son Thomas was listed as a member of the
   flight crew. Although Thomas was a pilot, he was not type certified to
   fly the N-22 and was thus unfamiliar with the particulars of its
   systems. A videotape taken by a passenger reveals that Chang had
   allowed Thomas to take the plane's controls at the time of the
   accident. A pilot more familiar with the aircraft would have known to
   allow the autopilot to correct for slats deployment, but Thomas's
   inexperience caused him to panic and assume manual control.
   Transpacific attempted to cover this up by changing his position on the
   crew list from first officer (a pilot with authorization to fly the
   plane) to flight engineer (a mechanic in charge of the aircraft
   systems). Chang - who had been knocked unconscious during the accident
   and later died in the hospital - was disguised as a first officer so
   that no one would realize he was outside the cockpit when the accident
   occurred.

   Despite her initial excitement at exonerating Norton, Casey realizes
   that she cannot publicize this information. Publicly pinning the blame
   for the accident on a TransPacific employee would sour relations with
   the airline, ruining future sales just as surely as any N-22 safety
   issues would.

   As Casey investigates further, she discovers a deeper plan at work.
   Richman had secretly plotted with another Norton executive, John
   Marder, to oust CEO Harold Edgarton from his position and seize control
   of the company. They intended to wait for an incident that would put
   the N-22's reputation in question and torpedo the company's deal with
   China. Then, once in control of Norton, they would finalize an even
   larger deal with a South Korean airline. The deal, already prepared,
   would initially be worth several billion dollars, leading to huge
   profits for current stockholders, but would eventually destroy the
   company by moving production of the wing overseas, giving critical
   know-how away to competitors.

   Casey manages to thwart the plan by revealing the truth to TV producer
   Jennifer Malone, who had promised to run a devastating report on the
   N-22's safety issues. Once Malone is shown the evidence, she cannot
   claim ignorance of the truth and air her report anyway without opening
   herself up to a defamation lawsuit. She is also unable to report the
   true story, since her boss doesn't think it's exciting enough to hold
   people's attention.

   With the N-22's reputation cleared, the China deal goes off without a
   hitch, and the company's future is secured. Afterwards, Edgarton
   promotes Casey to head the company's Media Relations Division. Richman
   is later arrested in Singapore for narcotics possession, while Marder
   leaves the company, supposedly on good terms.
