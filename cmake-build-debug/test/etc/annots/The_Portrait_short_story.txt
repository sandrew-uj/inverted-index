   "The Portrait" is the story of a young and penniless artist, Andrey
   Petrovich Chartkov, who stumbles upon a terrifyingly lifelike portrait
   in an art shop and is compelled to buy it. The painting is magical and
   offers him a dilemma -- to struggle to make his own way in the world on
   the basis of his own talents or to accept the assistance of the magic
   painting to guaranteed riches and fame. He chooses to become rich and
   famous, but when he comes upon a portrait from another artist which is
   "pure, faultless, beautiful as a bride"  he comes to realize that
   he has made the wrong choice. Eventually, he falls ill and dies from a
   fever.
