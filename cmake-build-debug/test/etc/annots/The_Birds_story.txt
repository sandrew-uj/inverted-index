   In a small Cornish seaside town in early December, wounded war veteran
   Nat Hocken is working part-time for a farm owner when he notices a
   large number of birds behaving strangely along the peninsula where his
   family lives. He attributes this to a recent cold snap and the sudden
   arrival of winter. That night, Nat hears a tapping on his bedroom
   window and encounters a bird that pecks his hand, causing him to bleed.
   As the night progresses he encounters more birds, especially those
   flocking into his children's room, but the birds leave at dawn. Nat
   reassures his wife that they were restless because of a sudden change
   in the weather.

   The next day, Nat tells his fellow workers about the night's events,
   but they give his story no credence. As Nat later walks to the beach to
   dispose of dead birds, he notices what appear to be whitecaps on the
   sea, but it is actually a great line of seagulls waiting for the tide
   to rise. When Nat arrives home, his concerns about the aggressive
   behaviour of the birds are confirmed by a radio report saying that
   birds are massing all over Britain and some people have been attacked,
   presumably because of the unnatural weather. When Nat notices more
   birds, including the gulls, above the sea waiting for the tide he
   decides to board up the windows and chimneys of his house as a
   precaution.

   Nat rushes to pick up his daughter, Jill, from the school bus stop to
   keep her safe. On his way back he spots his boss, Mr Trigg, who has a
   car, and persuades him to give Jill a lift home. Mr Trigg cheerfully
   professes to be unfazed by the announcements and plans on shooting at
   the birds for fun. He invites Nat to come along, but Nat rejects the
   offer and continues home, believing that hunting them would be futile.
   Just before he reaches home, the gulls descend and attack. Luckily, Nat
   manages to reach the cottage door with only minor injuries.

   Soon, massive flocks of birds attack. A national emergency is declared
   on BBC Radio, and people are told not to leave their homes. Then, due
   to the "unprecedented nature of the emergency," the BBC announces that
   it is going silent for the night and will resume broadcasting the next
   morning. For safety, Nat brings the family into the kitchen for the
   night. During their dinner they hear what sounds like aeroplanes
   overhead, followed by the sound of the planes crashing. The attacks
   from the birds die down, and Nat theorises that the birds will only
   attack at high tide.

   The next morning, wireless broadcasts do not resume and the radio is
   silent. The tide recedes, and Nat sets out to obtain supplies from his
   neighbours. He finds piles of dead birds around the houses; those still
   alive peer at him from afar. Nat walks to the farm where he is
   employed, only to find Mr Trigg, his wife and their workman dead. Later
   he finds the postman's body by the road; soon he comes to the
   realisation that his neighbours have all been killed by the birds. Nat
   returns home with the supplies but soon the birds attack once again. As
   if facing a firing squad, Nat smokes his last cigarette, then throws
   the empty pack into the fire and watches it burn.
