   Cordelia Naismith, the captain of a Betan Astronomical Survey ship, is
   exploring a newly discovered planet when her base camp is attacked.
   While investigating, she is surprised by a soldier, hits her head on a
   rock, and awakens to find that, while most of her crew has escaped, she
   is marooned with an injured Betan ensign and Captain Lord Aral
   Vorkosigan of Barrayar, notorious as the "Butcher of Komarr", who has
   been left for dead by a treacherous rival. During their five-day hike
   to a secret Barrayaran cache, she finds Vorkosigan not at all the
   monster his reputation suggests, and she is strongly attracted to him.

   When the trio reaches the base camp, Vorkosigan regains command of his
   crew. He returns to his ship with Cordelia and her crewman as his
   nominal prisoners. She meets Sergeant Bothari, a career soldier with
   mental problems who controls them through adherence to rules and an
   attachment to a strong commander, in this case, Vorkosigan.

   Vorkosigan informs Cordelia that upon their arrival on Barrayar, she
   will be free to return to Beta Colony; however, he asks her to marry
   him and remain on Barrayar as Lady Vorkosigan. Before she can consider
   his request, the crew of her ship, who have returned against her
   orders, join forces with Vorkosigan's rivals to "rescue" her. Cordelia
   helps defeat the resulting mutiny before returning with her crew to
   Beta Colony. During her captivity she realizes that the Barrayarans
   were taking over the planet because the system it was in provided a way
   to reach the Escobar system. Escobar is a rich system with many
   "wormhole" access points and thus control over a lot of interstellar
   trade.

   The invasion of the Escobar is led by Crown Prince Serg Vorbarra, the
   vicious son and heir of Emperor Ezar. Now a Captain in the Betan
   Expeditionary Force, Cordelia goes to Escobar in command of a decoy
   ship that distracts the Barrayaran ships on picket duty at the wormhole
   exit so that transport ships can deliver a devastating new Betan weapon
   to the defenders. She is captured by the sadistic Admiral Vorrutyer,
   who orders the now mentally unstable Sergeant Bothari to rape her.
   Bothari refuses, calling her "Admiral Vorkosigan's prisoner".
   Vorrutyer, who hates Vorkosigan, decides to do the job himself. He is
   unaware that Bothari has met Cordelia before. As she fills a profound
   psychological need of his, Bothari kills Vorrutyer before he can do
   anything. Vorkosigan, having heard who Vorrutyer is holding captive,
   comes to kill him himself only to find the deed already done. He hides
   Cordelia and Bothari in his cabin. In disgrace, he has been assigned a
   minor role in the invasion under the watchful eye of Imperial Security
   Lieutenant Simon Illyan, who has a brain implant that gives him total
   recall of all he sees and hears. However, he is required to report only
   to the Emperor, so he has to watch while Vorkosigan concocts a story
   that Cordelia killed Vorrutyer and escaped.

   The new weapons enable the Escobarans to drive the Barrayarans back
   with heavy losses. Crown Prince Serg and his flagship are lost, as are
   all officers senior to Vorkosigan, leaving him in charge. He commands
   his fleet's retreat. Cordelia overhears one critical fact and deduces
   that the entire invasion was orchestrated by the dying Emperor to
   remove his unstable son (via an honorable death in battle) and
   discredit the war party in order to avert a civil war after his death.
   When Vorkosigan no longer needs to hide her in his cabin, she is placed
   in the brig. The ship is attacked and Cordelia is injured as the
   violent maneuvers throw her around.

   Cordelia recovers in a prison camp on the same planet where she first
   met Vorkosigan. The camp inmates, mostly women, have been mistreated
   and in some cases raped by their captors. When Vorkosigan finds out, he
   summarily executes the commanding officer. Cordelia assumes command of
   the POWs by virtue of her rank and spends much of her time dealing
   directly with Vorkosigan, to whom she reveals her knowledge about the
   real reason for the Escobar campaign. She again rejects his marriage
   proposal because she sees what Barrayaran society does to people. When
   the war ends, prisoners are to be exchanged. Vorkosigan has to deal
   with a delivery of uterine replicators - artificial wombs, each
   containing a fetus from a woman raped by a Barrayaran soldier, one of
   which is Bothari's.

   On her way back to Beta Colony, Cordelia is unable to convince a
   psychiatrist that her injuries are not the result of being tortured by
   Vorkosigan, and her fervent denials only make it seem she has been
   psychologically tampered with as well. She is assumed to be an
   unwitting Barrayaran mole. She is afraid that she will be interrogated
   using drugs, revealing her knowledge of Vorkosigan's part in the death
   of Prince Serg. She escapes to Barrayar, where she marries Vorkosigan.
   She also encounters Bothari, now in Vorkosigan's father's personal
   guard and somewhat saner, thanks to better medical care. He has
   arranged for his daughter Elena to be cared for by a local woman.

   The dying Emperor Ezar Vorbarra insists Aral become the regent to his
   grandson and heir, the four-year-old Prince Gregor Vorbarra. Aral at
   first refuses, but Cordelia convinces him to take the job. They recruit
   the disabled Ensign Koudelka from Vorkosigan's old ship to act as
   Personal Secretary to the Regent. Cordelia has the pleasure of
   replacing Koudelka's rank insignia with those of a full Lieutenant.
