   At age sixteen, Roy Malcolm has made himself an expert in the history
   of aviation, so much so that he wins the Aviation Quiz Program,
   presented on television by World Airways, Inc. Because the prize was
   described as an all expenses paid trip to "any part of the earth"
   (rather than on Earth), Roy is able to request a trip to the Inner
   Station, which is considered part of Earth because its orbit lies under
   the one-thousand-kilometer limit of earth's legal territory.

   Riding the rocketship Sirius out of Port Goddard in the high mountains
   of New Guinea, Roy goes to the Inner Station, five hundred miles above
   Earth, for a two-week stay. He is first taken to meet Commander Doyle,
   who introduces him to a team of apprentices. Their leader, Tim Benton,
   shows Roy around the station. For the rest of his time on the station
   Roy stays with the apprentices, studying with them and sharing their
   activities. After a few days they take him to the Morning Star, the now
   derelict, though refurbished, rocketship that had taken five men to
   Venus in 1985. The old rocketship serves as a clubhouse for the young
   men.

   Because of the popularity of a TV series called Dan Drummond, Space
   Detective and one young man's pastime of trying to figure out how
   crime, especially piracy, could be profitable in space, Roy and his
   friends immediately become suspicious when the rocketship Cygnus and
   her secretive crew come to the Inner Station. Two of the apprentices go
   to investigate when the ship is left unattended and find that she's
   carrying what appear to be ray guns. It turns out that the ship belongs
   to a movie studio that intends to shoot the first movie filmed in
   space.

   As his stay in space is coming to an end Roy gets to ride the Morning
   Star as she makes an emergency run to the Space Hospital with a
   seriously ill man. As Roy and his friends return to the Inner Station
   on a different ship they become so engrossed in Commander Doyle's story
   of his participation in the first expedition to Mercury that they fail
   to notice that their ship is off course: it's heading away from Earth
   rather than toward it. As they swing around the Moon they refuel their
   ship from a container catapulted to them from the crater Hipparchus,
   then they return to the Inner Station after making a short stop at one
   of the Relay Stations in geostationary orbit to get extra oxygen.

   Roy has to spend several extra days at the Residential Station before
   he returns to Earth. There he meets the Moore family, Martian colonists
   coming to Earth so that the children can attend college. After
   listening to their talk about their home and seeing the pictures that
   they show him, Roy changes his future plans: he intends now that he
   will go beyond the space stations when he graduates from college and
   head out to the planets.
