   As described in a review in a film magazine, in 1940, Elmer Smith
   (Foxe) proposes to Hattie (Perdue), his childhood sweetheart, and she
   turns him down, saying that she would not marry him if he were the last
   man on earth. He jumps in his plane, determined to go where there are
   no women. A strange disease known as "masculitis" develops that kills
   all the males over fourteen years old. Women now run the world. Ten
   years later, Gertie (Cunard), a gangster, while fleeing from the police
   finds herself in a forest and discovers Elmer, who has been living as a
   hermit. She brings him back and, after he is examined at a hospital,
   the government buys him for $10,000,000 as he is the last man on earth.
   Then arises the problem of what to do with him. Two lazy senators
   engage in a prize fight, the winner to claim him as a husband. His
   former sweetheart Hattie attends the fight and Elmer sees her. Then it
   is all off as he rushes to Hattie, keeping the other women at bay. They
   marry and a year later, twin boys are born.
