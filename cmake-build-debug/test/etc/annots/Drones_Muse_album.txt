   On their previous albums The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012),
   Muse incorporated orchestral and electronic music. In December
   2013, they released the live album and video Live at Rome Olympic
   Stadium; songwriter Matt Bellamy said the band wanted the release "to
   capture some of the extremes of what we've been doing since we want to
   go in a different direction in the future."

   Muse began writing their seventh album soon after the Rome concert.
   Bellamy stated that the album "should be something that really does
   strip away the additional things that we've experimented with on the
   last two albums... I kind of feel like it will be nice to reconnect and
   remind ourselves of just the basics of who we are." The band felt
   the electronic side of their music was becoming too dominant. According
   to bassist Chris Wolstenholme, some of the music on The 2nd Law was
   "somewhat of a bore to play live, and I'm not too certain how much of
   it worked for our shows ... The logical step was to strip away all the
   outer layers and go back to the way we started. Sometimes, making
   things simpler makes them more powerful."
