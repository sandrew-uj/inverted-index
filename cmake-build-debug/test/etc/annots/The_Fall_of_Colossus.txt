   Five years have passed since the super computer called Colossus used
   its control over the world's nuclear weapons to take control of
   humanity. In our timeline, that would place this story in the 1990s or
   the early 2000s. All references in the novel, however, place it in the
   22nd century, with the 20th and 21st being mentioned in the past.
   Colossus has been superseded by an even more advanced computer system
   built on the Isle of Wight, which has abolished war and poverty
   throughout the world. National competition and most sports have been
   replaced by the Sea War Game, where replicas of World War I
   dreadnoughts battle each other for viewing audiences. A group known as
   the Sect, which worships Colossus as a god, is growing in numbers and
   influence. Yet despite the seeming omnipresence of Colossus' secret
   police and the penalty of decapitation for anti-machine activities, a
   secret Fellowship exists that is dedicated to the computer's
   destruction.

   Charles Forbin, in his early 50s in this and the first novel, is the
   former head of the design team that built and activated the original
   Colossus. He now lives on the Isle of Wight with his wife and son,
   serving the computer as Director of Staff. Though contemptuous of the
   growing cult of personality around Colossus, he has reconciled himself
   to Colossus' rule. His wife Cleo, now 28 years old (35 in the previous
   novel), loathes Colossus and is a member of the Fellowship. One
   afternoon while taking her son to a secluded beach, she receives a
   radio transmission from the planet Mars. Identifying Cleo as a member
   of the Fellowship, the transmission offers help to destroy Colossus and
   asks her to return to the same spot the next day for further
   instructions. She returns with Edward Blake, Colossus' Director of
   Input and the head of the Fellowship. Together, they receive
   instructions to obtain a circuit diagram of one of Colossus' input
   terminals and a sample of the information that is fed into it, along
   with instructions to proceed to two locations -- one in St. John's,
   Newfoundland, the other in New York's Central Park -- to receive
   further transmissions.

   Though Blake passes the necessary information along to Cleo, she is
   quickly arrested by the Sect and sentenced by Colossus to spend three
   months at an "Emotional Study Center" on the island of Tahiti, where
   she is repeatedly raped as part of an experiment designed to help
   Colossus better understand human emotion. Now under suspicion, Blake
   approaches Forbin, who is devastated by his wife's arrest. Explaining
   the details of their plot, Blake convinces Forbin to help after
   explaining the details of Cleo's captivity. Forbin travels in disguise
   with the requested information, first to St. John's, then to New York
   City, where he receives an incomprehensible mathematical problem that
   the transmission claims will destroy Colossus once it is fed into the
   computer.

   Upon his return, Forbin slips the problem to Blake, who enters it into
   Colossus. While Forbin converses with the computer, Colossus begins to
   make verbal errors, then stops. Increasingly erratic, it attempts to
   warn Forbin of a threat from outer space that it was preparing to meet,
   but breaks down before it can complete the message. Now free of
   Colossus' rule, Blake moves to seize power, using the automated fleets
   of the Sea War Games to threaten the world's capitals. As Blake gloats,
   Forbin tells him of Colossus' warning. Requesting any reports of
   unusual astronomical activity, they learn that two contacts have been
   detected leaving Martian orbit and are now heading toward the Earth.
   The novel ends with the two men hearing a radio transmission repeating
   "Forbin, we are coming".
