   Lyle works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and spends
   evenings seated close to the television, rapidly flipping channels,
   while his wife Pammy works at a "grief management firm" in the World
   Trade Center. While their marriage is free of problems and they have
   many friends, a cloud of ennui hangs over their domestic life.

   Pammy joins her friends Ethan and Jack on a trip to Maine, where they
   come to the realization that their collective nostalgia for simpler
   times and rural life is largely invented. Pammy begins a sexual
   relationship with Jack, who is in a homosexual relationship with Ethan,
   which ultimately ends in Jack's inexplicable self-immolation at a
   nearby junkyard.

   Meanwhile, in a divergent and concurrent storyline, Lyle witnesses the
   shooting death of one of his acquaintances, George Sedbauer, on the
   floor of the exchange. Through this event, Lyle becomes privy to a
   vague conspiracy of violent terrorists targeting Wall Street, and his
   curiosity draws him into their fold. His recruitment and participation
   are equally inexplicable, a function of the draw of revolutionary
   activity and respite from the boredom of his ordinary life. His
   engagement with the radicals, themselves devoid of any morality or
   particular ideology, becomes more absurd when he attempts to inform on
   them to equally ill-defined government agents, and begins having sexual
   relationships with two other conspirators. Lyle discovers that J.
   Kinnear, one of the shadow key figures in the terrorist network, is a
   double-agent himself and the web of essentially meaningless
   conspiracies appears to be endless and be the end in itself; pursued
   not for chaotic ends, but for the sake of imposing structural order on
   what the "players" view to be chaos.
