   The plot starts in Naples, Italy in the 18th century, in the church of
   Santa Maria del Pianto, where an English traveller is speaking with an
   Italian friar. The Englishman notices a man of extraordinary appearance
   in a shadowy area of the church, who is an assassin, according to the
   friar. When the Englishman asks why this assassin is protected in the
   church, an Italian friend travelling with him directs his attention to
   a famous confessional in the church, which was the scene of a
   particularly startling confession. He offers to send him a narrative
   relating this former assassin's confession, and the problems that
   attended it, to his hotel, and the two retire from the church and go
   their separate ways. The Englishman reads the story in his hotel room
   as follows:

   It is 1758 in the church of San Lorenzo in Naples where Vincentio di
   Vivaldi sees the beautiful Ellena di Rosalba with her aunt, Signora
   Bianchi. Vivaldi is struck with her beauty, and intends to court her,
   with the hopes that they will end up married. When Vivaldi's mother,
   the proud Marchesa, hears about his love for a poor orphan, she appeals
   to her ambitious and cunning confessor, Father Schedoni, to prevent the
   marriage, with a promise that she will help him obtain promotion in his
   order. As Vivaldi continues to visit Signora Bianchi at Villa Altieri,
   he is approached by a monk, who seems to be an apparition, threatening
   him to keep away from the villa and Ellena. After each encounter,
   Vivaldi tries in vain to capture the strange monk, with the help of his
   friend Bonarmo and his faithful servant Paulo. Vivaldi suspects that
   the monk is Father Schedoni, and is determined to know why his
   courtship of Ellena is discouraged. After being promised the hand of
   Ellena and appointed her guardian by Signora Bianchi before her sudden
   mysterious death, Vivaldi finds that Ellena has been kidnapped from the
   villa, and immediately deduces it is by the hand of the Marchesa and
   Schedoni. Leaving Naples secretly in pursuit of her abductors, Vivaldi
   and Paulo eventually find Ellena held at the remote convent of San
   Stefano, at the mercy of a cruel Lady Abbess, and Vivaldi infiltrates
   the convent disguised as a religious pilgrim to rescue her. In the
   convent, Ellena befriends a lovely but melancholy nun, Sister Olivia,
   who helps her escape from the convent into the care of Vivaldi.

   While riding towards Naples after the escape, Vivaldi presses Ellena
   for an immediate marriage, and she finally consents. But moments before
   they are to take their vows before a priest at a church, agents
   claiming to work for the Inquisition, informed by Schedoni, interrupt
   and arrest Vivaldi on the false charge of abducting a nun from a
   convent. Vivaldi and Paulo are taken to the prisons of the Inquisition
   in Rome to be questioned and put to trial. They are confused about the
   circumstances behind their confinement, which their captors will not
   reveal. Ellena, however, is sent by order of Schedoni to a lone house
   on the seashore, inhabited only by the villain Spalatro, Schedoni's
   accomplice in previous crimes, to be murdered. Schedoni comes to the
   house to assassinate Ellena personally, but becomes convinced from a
   portrait on her person that she is his daughter. Schedoni has a change
   of heart, and decides to take Ellena personally back to Naples to hide
   her from the Marchesa. While on their journey, they once again
   encounter the dismissed Spalatro, who had followed them with designs of
   extorting money from Schedoni, but Spalatro is shot in a scuffle and
   left behind (and shortly after dies of fever). Schedoni and Ellena
   arrive in Naples, where Schedoni places Ellena in the convent of Santa
   Maria del Pianto until Vivaldi can be freed. Schedoni returns to the
   Marchesa, keeping secret his endorsement of the marriage of the
   Marchesa's son and his daughter, but distracts the Marchesa temporarily
   with information that Ellena comes from a noble lineage, so a marriage
   would at least be proper, if not lucrative. Meanwhile, in the prison of
   the Inquisition, the mysterious monk who had previously eluded Vivaldi,
   now known to be Nicola di Zampari, appears and narrates to him the
   guilty crimes of Father Schedoni before he became a monk, and convinces
   him to formally call Schedoni and Father Ansaldo, to whom Schedoni had
   previously disclosed his deeds in a confessional booth, to the trial as
   the accused and witness, respectively, in the crimes. Both are made to
   appear before the tribunal, where Schedoni is convicted from their
   testimony of murdering his brother, as well as marrying and later
   stabbing his brother's wife in a jealous rage, in his former life as
   the dissolute Count di Bruno, or Count di Marinella. Schedoni is
   sentenced to death, and before he is led away into confinement, tells
   Vivaldi his relationship to Ellena and her whereabouts. Vivaldi is also
   escorted back to his cell, with the knowledge that the charges against
   him will be dropped. Schedoni, on his deathbed, in the presence of the
   tribunal, further reveals that he had already fatally poisoned both
   himself and his betrayer Nicola with poison concealed in his vest.
   Schedoni also had notified the Marchese of Vivaldi's situation, who
   hurries to Rome to secure his son's release.

   Back at the convent, Ellena distinguishes a voice all too familiar, and
   sees her dearly loved Sister Olivia in the convent courtyard. While the
   two recount each other's experiences since they last parted, Ellena's
   servant Beatrice comes to report the sudden death of the Marchesa from
   a long-dormant but natural illness (having Confessed, the Marchesa has
   also exacted a promise from her husband that he should sanction the
   marriage of Ellena and Vivaldi). Beatrice and Olivia recognize each
   other, and elate Ellena with the news that she is the daughter of
   Olivia, who is revealed to be the Countess di Bruno, whom Schedoni had
   stabbed in jealous rage and left for dead. This leads Ellena to realize
   that she is actually not Schedoni's daughter, but his niece. Since they
   are of the same lineage, Ellena is still from a noble family, which
   would allow her to marry Vivaldi with honour. Once it is revealed that
   Ellena is from an aristocratic family, it is determined that she has
   the royal blood that allows her to be worthy of marrying Vivaldi.

   The ending of the novel is a happy one; Vivaldi and Paulo are released
   from prison, Ellena is reunited with her mother, and Vivaldi and Ellena
   are joined in marriage, and all the villains have died. The Marchesa
   dies shortly before finding out that her son has been freed from
   prison. Father Schedoni, condemned to die, poisons himself and Nicola
   di Zampari, and calls a tribunal including the Marchese and Vivaldi to
   witness their final confessions at his deathbed.
