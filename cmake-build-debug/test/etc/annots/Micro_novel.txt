   The narrative begins with a private investigator named Marcos Rodriguez
   pulling up to a metal building located on the island of Oahu. The
   building is the main headquarters of Nanigen Micro-Technologies, a
   research company that specializes in discovering new types of medicine.
   Disguised as a security guard, Rodriguez enters the unattended building
   and begins searching the grounds for an unknown object. As he makes his
   way through the halls of the building, however, he begins to notice
   mysterious, ultra-fine cuts appearing on his body. Spooked, Rodriguez
   flees the building.

   Shortly after leaving the Nanigen headquarters, Rodriguez makes his way
   to the office of his employer, Willy Fong. When he arrives, he notices
   another man, of Chinese descent, waiting in the office. Fong begins to
   question Rodriguez about his cuts, but before Rodriguez can explain,
   the Chinese man's throat is slit by an unseen force. Fong and Rodriguez
   barely have time to react before they are also killed. Their deaths are
   reported as a triple-suicide, and Lieutenant Dan Watanabe of the
   Honolulu Police Department is assigned to investigate the case.

   In Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard graduate student Peter Jansen is
   collecting venom from a cobra for further experimentation. He is joined
   in the biology lab by six other graduate students: Rick Hutter, an
   ethnobotanist; Karen King, an arachnologist; Erika Moll, an
   entomologist and coleopterist; Amar Singh, a botanist; Jenny Linn, a
   biochemist studying pheromones; and Danny Minot, a doctoral student
   studying the linguistics of science. They are visited by the CEO of
   Nanigen, Vincent "Vin" Drake, along with his CFO, Alyson Bender, and
   Peter's brother Eric, who is a vice president at Nanigen. The seven
   students are recruited by Drake to work with him at a laboratory in
   Hawaii. Although they are at first reluctant, they all decide to take
   Drake's offer and fly out to Oahu.

   The following morning, Peter receives vague text messages from Eric
   urging him not to come to Hawaii. Peter tries calling Eric, but gets no
   response. Shortly afterwards he is called by Bender, who informs Peter
   that Eric has been in a boating accident and is likely dead. Peter
   flies to Oahu and meets with Watanabe, who shows him a video of Eric
   scrambling around the deck of his boat before jumping overboard. Peter
   notices Bender in the video, observing the scene unfold without a hint
   of concern on her face.

   With assistance from one of Hutter's friends, Peter hacks Nanigen's
   phone records and finds a cryptic exchange between Bender and Drake,
   which confirm his suspicions about Eric's death. He saves the
   conversation onto a drive and plans to play it out loud during the
   students' scheduled tour of Nanigen in order to expose Drake. When the
   tour commences, Peter sneaks away from the group to find a place to
   insert the drive, stealing a wireless microphone while doing so and
   hiding it in his shirt. However, Drake catches Peter and takes him into
   another room where he beats him. Drake confesses that he did set up
   Eric to be killed on the boat. He then realizes that Peter had a
   microphone hidden in his pocket and that the other graduate students
   heard everything.

   Drake activates an emergency alarm and drags Peter into the room where
   the rest of the graduate students are waiting. He orders them to follow
   him, with Bender in tow. He leads them to the tensor generator, a
   machine that uses extreme magnetic fields to shrink anything, even
   living organisms. Drake rushes the seven students inside, along with
   the generator's operator, Jarel Kinsky (the only other person in the
   room) and shrinks them all down to half an inch in height. As the
   disoriented subjects adjust to their new micro-surroundings, Drake
   places them into a plastic bag and takes them into another room, where
   a snake is being held. He drops Peter inside the snake's tank and
   leaves.

   Before the snake can eat Peter, the other students save him by using
   wasp pheromone to cover Peter's scent and spider thread to pull him
   out. Bender, knowing that Drake will not stop until the students are
   dead, hides them and Kinsky inside a paper bag. When Drake returns, she
   insists that they escaped and are hiding in the room. As Drake orders
   the room to be gassed, Bender leaves with the bag and drives to
   Nanigen's arboretum. However, Drake realizes that Bender has misled him
   and follows her there, where he confronts her about the bag. Bender
   admits that she hid the students, and Drake feigns understanding of her
   concerns before sending her into the forest to kill them. As she walks
   into the trees, however, King uses her knife to cut open the bag,
   causing everyone in the bag to fall out. Realizing Bender betrayed him
   after she admits helping the shrunken students escape, Drake kills her.

   Kinsky tells the students about supply stations, shrunken bases where
   shrunken Nanigen staff can observe safely. However, Kinsky is killed
   after getting too close to an ant colony by ant "guards". The remaining
   seven get to the first supply base, but their base and all the others
   are being removed on Drake's orders by Don Makele, the Nanigen security
   chief, who spots them and reports it to Drake.

   Soon after, Jenny drowns when Danny, who at first tries to help her,
   instead releases her hand in a panic and watches her slip under, having
   been afraid that she would have pulled him in with her causing him to
   drown as well. Only Jenny sees his treachery before she dies.

   Meanwhile, Drake shrinks two Nanigen security members, and tasks them
   to find and kill the students in the forest, if they have not died
   already, claiming that the students were attempting industrial
   espionage. The students, though, adjust well to the micro-world, and
   utilize their scientific expertise to survive and outwit dangerous
   insects. When the assassins track them down, they manage to kill Amar
   and Peter before the students kill them in self-defense. They steal the
   assassins' shrunken vehicle, and head for the last Nanigen base they
   know about from which they might fly back to the Tensor generator.
   Unknown to Drake, or anyone else, Eric, Peter's brother, is still alive
   and is searching for the graduate students.

   After Erika is killed by birds, the three remaining students reach the
   Tantalus Nanigen base, but find no miniature airplanes. They encounter
   a fugitive Ben Rourke, the inventor of the Tensor generator, and also
   hunted by Drake, who has managed to adapt and survive in the
   micro-world. He gives them urgent medical attention and offers them
   three miniature planes that he has repaired. He explains that he has
   learned to survive the "microbends", a fatal sickness that afflicts
   shrunken humans. Danny, panicking due to larvae laid in his arm by a
   wasp, betrays the group by contacting Drake and offering him Rourke's
   "microbends" remedy in return for his hospitalization and safety. He
   steals a micro-plane to meet Drake but is killed when his plane is
   attacked by bats. The next morning, the students, now only Rick and
   Karen, escape from Rourke's base in the remaining planes as Drake
   torches the Tantalus base, killing Rourke. They find Eric, who leads
   them back to Nanigen's headquarters.

   Meanwhile, Makele confesses to the local police force that he is
   complicit in Nanigen's and Drake's crimes, and a police force is sent
   to Nanigen to arrest Drake. Eric and the students arrive at Nanigen
   first and encounter Drake, who activates micro-bots to attack Eric and
   a fight ensues. The two students finally re-enter the Tensor generator
   and return to full size. A micro-bot that attempted to attack them is
   enlarged as well, to the size "of a refrigerator". In the fighting,
   Drake is trapped in the Tensor generator room and is attacked by his
   own micro-bots, as well as the enlarged micro-bot, while the full-size
   Karen and Rick rescue an injured Eric. After Drake is killed, the
   enlarged micro-bot destroys the room and Tensor generator, though a
   business partner of Drake's, Edward Catel, makes off with a disc
   containing information on the Tensor generator, intending to sell it
   off. The police finally arrive.

   The two surviving students fall in love. Karen plans to return to the
   micro-world, enraptured by the beauty and diversity of life.
