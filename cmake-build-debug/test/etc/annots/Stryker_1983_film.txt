   After nuclear war has defoliated the Earth, the survivors live in
   colonies in a endless quest for drinkable water. A young woman named
   Delha is on the run from the evil warlord Kardis and his henchman. She
   is rescued by Stryker and his young companion Bandit. She later finds
   herself trapped again by Kardis and resists torture to reveal the
   location of her colony.

   Meanwhile, Stryker and Bandit ambush a Kardis water tanker, drive it to
   his fortress, and manage to escape with Delha. Delha reveals that she
   has been trying to contact Trun, Stryker's estranged brother, to assist
   in the defence against Kardis. Trun has been captured and buried by
   Kardis' men, but is rescued by Stryker. Trun has his lieutenant Bazil
   to gather his army, but Bazil suddenly betrays them, leading Kardis to
   attack the colony.

   Stryker is then captured and tortured, but is rescued by a group of
   dwarves to whom he had previously given precious water. After a final
   climatic battle, Trun's battalion defeats Kardis' army with help of
   Stryker and the dwarves.
