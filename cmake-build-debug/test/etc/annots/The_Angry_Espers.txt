   Paul Corban wakes up in a hospital on an alien world populated by
   people who look exactly like Terrans. When he tries to talk to the
   doctors, though, his questions are met with looks of horror and
   revulsion and with an eerie silence. His wounds from the crash of his
   spaceship heal and his hosts offer what appears to be a kind of
   therapy, always in total silence. He fails to meet the therapists'
   expectations (he can't even figure out what they are), so he is taken
   to a pleasant place called Raxtinu, an asylum for the mentally
   disabled.

   In Raxtinu he meets the lovely Dr. Alir, who teaches him the spoken
   version of the Donirian telepathic language. He has, by this time,
   discerned that the Donirians possess the powers of telepathy,
   telekinesis, and teleportation. He has also fallen in love with Alir.
   Nonetheless, he wants to go home and when he knows enough Donirian he
   explains this fact to Alir and Director Wiln. After giving Wiln all of
   the information he can about the Galactic Federation, he and Wiln are
   shocked to discover that he won't be sent home after all: the Donirian
   government has chosen instead to wage a war of extermination against
   the Federation.

   After giving Wiln the information on the Federation Paul learns from
   another lost Terran how hideously bigoted the Donirians are, how deeply
   they hate anyone who does not share their teledynamic abilities. Other
   lost Terrans who had landed on Donir seeking help have been lynched.
   And now the Federation is under attack by people who regard all Terrans
   as demented savages. The conflict quickly degenerates into a war of
   atrocity and attrition.

   Meanwhile, Paul is taken out of Raxtinu, which is a refuge for people
   who lack teledynamic powers, and put into an asylum for the truly
   insane. Before the inmates can kill him Alir rescues him from the
   asylum, taking him to her mother's estate. There Alir and her mother
   resume the therapy that had been intended to help Paul develop
   teledynamic powers, a therapy that has so far failed. Then soldiers
   appear on the estate and Paul hides from them by climbing into a tree.
   The soldiers find him and one aims a weapon at him and fires. Paul
   loses consciousness.

   He regains consciousness lying on the same spot in Raxtinu that he had
   been thinking about when the soldier shot him: he infers that he
   teleported and he goes to inform Director Wiln. Wiln discerns which
   weapon was used, a kind of stun gun, and he uses it as a therapeutic
   device to help Paul develop his latent teledynamic powers. Later, as a
   fully developed teledyne, Paul goes before the Donirian Council and
   convinces its members to sue for peace. The Council then chooses Paul
   and Alir to serve as its ambassadors to the Galactic Federation.

   In this ending, of a protagonist gaining his freedom from alien captors
   by developing teledynamic abilities, The Angry Espers may remind the
   reader of the ending of Alan E. Nourse's Rocket to Limbo.^[1]
