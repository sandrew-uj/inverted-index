   A global nuclear war has turned most of Earth into a contaminated
   wasteland, with humanity's survivors now fighting over the few
   uncontaminated food and water supplies still remaining. Kenshiro, a
   master of the deadly martial art Hokuto Shinken, is traveling with his
   fiancee Yuria when they are confronted by a gang led by Ken's former
   friend Shin, a master of the rival Nanto Seiken style. Shin proclaims
   that he has been in love with Yuria for a long time and, with no law to
   intervene now, challenges Ken over her. After defeating Ken in combat,
   Shin engraves seven wounds on Ken's chest and leaves him for dead,
   taking Yuria with him. Ken's eldest brother-in-training Raoh, having
   witnessed the fight without intervening, returns to his dojo, where he
   finds his sensei Ryuken meditating. Raoh challenges Ryuken's decision
   to choose Ken as the Hokuto Shinken successor over him and kills him,
   proclaiming he will become the ruler of the new world.

   A year passes and Ken now wanders the wasteland as a hero who protects
   the weak and innocent from those who prey on them. He rescues a couple
   of young children named Bat and Lin from a gang of bandits and allies
   himself with another Nanto Seiken master named Rei, who is searching
   for his kidnapped sister Airi. Ken learns that Airi's kidnapper is none
   other than Jagi, another former brother-in-training who has been
   impersonating Ken in an attempt to tarnish his reputation and draw him
   out. Ken heads to Jagi's hideout and defeats him, rescuing Airi in the
   process. Before he dies a gruesome death, Jagi reveals that he was the
   one who convinced Shin to betray Ken and that he is now living with
   Yuria in his stronghold, the city of Southern Cross.

   Elsewhere, Raoh, now a conqueror known as Ken-oh (King of Fists), has
   amassed a huge army, expanding his domain by defeating rival warlords
   and begins heading to Southern Cross. There, Yuria is treated with a
   life of luxury, living under the rule of Shin, who now leads his own
   army as well. However, Yuria refuses Shin's gifts of affection, longing
   to be reunited with Ken. When she overhears that Ken is still alive,
   she attempts to sneak out of the city, only to be taken captive by
   Raoh, who challenges Shin to a fight to the death. A while later,
   Kenshiro arrives at Southern Cross, only to find the city in flames and
   Shin's soldiers dead. Shin is still alive and fights Ken, but the
   battle does not last long, as Shin has already suffered a mortal wound
   from his encounter with Raoh. Before dying, Shin tells Ken that Raoh
   has taken Yuria captive and has headed to Cassandra, the City of
   Wailing Demons.

   Lin arrives at Cassandra along with Bat and Rei, where they witness
   Raoh's army marching through the streets. Lin sees Yuria being held by
   Raoh's men during the parade and decides to break into Raoh's dungeon
   later that night with Bat. The two meet Yuria in her cell and leave her
   with a plant grown from a seed Yuria gave to Ken before leaving. The
   plant catches Raoh's attention and Yuria is immediately sentenced to a
   public execution the following morning. Rei challenges Raoh, but he
   proves to be no match for him. Ken rushes to Cassandra, but arrives too
   late to stop Raoh from inflicting a mortal wound on Rei. After Rei
   dies, Kenshiro and Raoh unleash their full fighting aura to battle each
   other, destroying most of Cassandra in the process and leaving both
   substantially injured. With the two exhausted of all their power and
   strength, Raoh manages to knock Ken unconscious. However, before Raoh
   can deliver the finishing blow, Lin interrupts the fight and implores
   him to spare Ken's life. Raoh agrees to Lin's request and walks away,
   swearing to postpone the battle for another day. Ken leaves Lin and
   Bat, and continues his search for Yuria, who mysteriously vanished
   during the final battle.
