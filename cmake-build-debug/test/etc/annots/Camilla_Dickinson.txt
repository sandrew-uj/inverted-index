   Fifteen-year-old Camilla Dickinson narrates an important period of her
   life spanning approximately three weeks in November 1950. Camilla lives
   on Park Avenue in New York City with her wealthy parents Rose, who is
   beautiful yet irresponsible and overdramatic, and Rafferty, a stern,
   responsible architect. The quiet, thoughtful and undramatic Camilla
   dreams of becoming an astronomer, but must deal with the constant ups
   and downs of her parents' troubled marriage. Rose has begun an affair
   with a man named Jacques, which Camilla accidentally discovers when she
   walks in on Rose and Jacques kissing. Rose begs Camilla to keep it a
   secret, but Rafferty wants Camilla to be honest and tell him the truth.
   Rose and Rafferty fight, and Rose ends up attempting suicide, which has
   the desired effect of bringing Rafferty back to her. Camilla is torn
   between her loyalty to both parents, and begins to realize they are
   very imperfect people. She also has difficulty dealing with her
   feelings towards her parents, and initially does not want to discuss
   her situation with anyone outside the family.

   Camilla's new best friend, Luisa Rowan, has parents with a similarly
   dysfunctional marriage who fight constantly and seem likely to get a
   divorce. In contrast to Camilla, Luisa's family is not affluent, she
   lives in Greenwich Village with bohemian parents, and she is more open
   to discussing her family problems. Luisa aspires to become a
   psychiatrist and at one point attempts to psychoanalyze Camilla.

   Camilla then meets and befriends Frank, Luisa's older brother. Frank
   understands Camilla's problems and assists her in accepting her
   parents' flaws. Frank encourages Camilla to define herself, not by her
   family, but to define herself as who she truly is. Frank also takes the
   sheltered Camilla to see people and places that she has never
   experienced before, including visiting a young, disabled war veteran
   who ends up giving Camilla her first kiss. Frank and Camilla have deep
   conversations about life, religion, philosophy, growing up, and dealing
   with difficult situations, and the pair begin to form a romantic
   attachment, much to the chagrin of Luisa. Despite Luisa's anger,
   Camilla feels that Frank is the one person she can really talk to.

   Just as Camilla is getting comfortable with the way things are,
   everything changes again. Frank and Luisa's parents break up, and Frank
   is forced to suddenly move away with his father, without even telling
   Camilla goodbye in person. Camilla's parents decide to work on their
   marriage and go on a European vacation together, sending Camilla to
   boarding school while they're gone. While Camilla is heartbroken by the
   loss of her closest relationships, she uses the inner strength she has
   gained in the past weeks to deal with the changes in her life.
