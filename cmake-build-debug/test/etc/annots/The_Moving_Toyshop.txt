   Famous poet Richard Cadogan takes an impromptu holiday to Oxford, where
   he studied at the university, after growing bored with the literary
   life in the suburbs. After finding himself in a high street, in the
   middle of the night and with no place to stay, he stumbles across a
   shop with its awning still up. Closer inspection reveals it to be a
   toyshop, and on finding the door unlocked, curiosity leads Cadogan
   inside, then up a flight of stairs to a flat where he finds the
   murdered body of an elderly woman, before being knocked unconscious. He
   wakes up the next morning in a supply closet, but after escaping and
   bringing back the police, the toyshop is no longer there, replaced, it
   seems, with a grocer's.

   Bewildered, Cadogan turns to an old friend at Oxford University,
   eccentric professor and amateur sleuth Gervase Fen, to help him solve
   the mystery of the moving toyshop.
