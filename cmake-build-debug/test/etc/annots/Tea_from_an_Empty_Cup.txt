   Tea From an Empty Cup is at its core a tightly plotted detective novel.

   The story revolves around near mythical Japan, which has been destroyed
   in a vaguely described natural cataclysm several decades before the
   story opens. The generation that remembers "Old Japan" appears to have
   passed on. A virtual version of Japan has become a sort of holy grail
   for a core group of artificial reality addicts. Artificial Reality, or
   AR, like "post-apocalyptic Noo Yawk Sitty" has become immensely popular
   in an increasingly dreary overcrowded world, not just as a game, but as
   a way of life.

   AR is not just a way of life, it turns out, but also of death, as
   homicide detective Dore Konstantin discovers when she is called upon to
   investigate the death of a young man in an artificial reality parlour
   (think video arcade with a full wired body suit) and discovers he died
   the same way in the game as in reality. She therefore decides to
   investigate this young man's life within the artificial realities he
   frequented, even though the legal precedents already established mean
   that nothing she discovers is admissible as evidence because
   "Everything is a Lie" in AR. In the process she stumbles onto something
   far more complicated than a mere murder case.

   In Tea from an Empty Cup's interwoven storyline, Yuki, a young
   ethnically Japanese woman is desperately looking for her boyfriend Tom,
   whom she fears has taken up with a mysterious and notorious woman named
   Joy Flower, becoming one of "Joy's Boyz", about whom a lot of nasty
   rumours circulate.

   When Yuki seeks Joy Flower out, she immediately is taken into Joy's
   inner circle, becoming her personal assistant, which leads her, like
   Konstantin, into a voyage of discovery towards the central mystery of
   the book.
