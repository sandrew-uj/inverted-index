   15-year-old Neil Miller's world explodes when he and his family are
   involved in a car accident that kills his parents. Sent to live with
   his grandparents in a small village named Winchelsea, England, Neil
   suffers from post traumatic stress. Soon, a devastating illness, called
   the Calcutta Plague, makes headlines, killing thousands of people in
   India in a matter of months. The virus begins spreading across the
   world, making its way to the small village where Neil lives. It is a
   strange illness as it only affects the adults and none of the children,
   and once again Neil finds himself an orphan after his grandparents
   succumb to the disease.

   Neil attempts to care for two younger children also orphaned by the
   plague, but they also contract the virus and die as he tries to care
   for them. During this time Neil notes that he has contracted the
   plague, but after a brief fever it leaves him unaffected. Now the sole
   survivor in Winchelsea and deciding that the village is becoming
   dangerous - packs of wild dogs, - he leaves for London, taking first a
   manual Mini which he has difficulty driving, followed by an automatic
   Jaguar.

   Arriving in London he meets his first fellow survivor - the mentally
   unbalanced Clive, who although friendly towards Neil, during the night
   vandalizes his car to the point of destroying it, steals his mother's
   ring that Neil had kept, which was the only memory of his mother he
   had, and then abandons him in central London.

   Soon after he finds two girls, Lucy and Billie, creating an unstable
   threesome. Attracted to Neil, Lucy begins pulling away from Billie, and
   in her fear of loneliness and out of desperation attempts to kill Neil
   when they are on a foraging expedition. She stabs him in the back. Neil
   discovers she has emptied his gun but he manages to overpower Billie
   and escapes back to Lucy.

   Billie arrives back at the house and pleads with both Lucy and Neil to
   let her back in, but they decide that they could never trust her again,
   and leave her outside. In the last paragraph of the book Neil abruptly
   changes his mind, feeling that he would never get over the guilt of
   leaving Billie to die, and with Lucy goes downstairs to open the door
   and let her back inside.
