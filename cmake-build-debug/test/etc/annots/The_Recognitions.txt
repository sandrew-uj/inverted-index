   The story loosely follows the life of Wyatt Gwyon, son of a Calvinist
   minister from rural New England; his mother dies in Spain. He plans to
   follow his father into the ministry. But he is inspired to become a
   painter by The Seven Deadly Sins, Hieronymous Bosch's noted painting
   which his father owned. Gwyon leaves New England and travels to Europe
   to study painting. Discouraged by a corrupt critic and frustrated with
   his career, he moves to New York City.

   He meets Recktall Brown, a capitalistic collector and dealer of art,
   who makes a Faustian deal with him. Gwyon is to produce paintings in
   the style of 15th-century Flemish and Dutch masters (such as Bosch,
   Hugo van der Goes, and Hans Memling) and forge their signatures. Brown
   will sell them as newly discovered originals. Gwyon becomes discouraged
   and returns home to find that his father has converted to Mithraism and
   is losing his mind. Back in New York, Gwyon tries to expose his
   forgeries. He travels to Spain where he visits the monastery where his
   mother was buried, works at restoring old paintings, and tries to find
   himself in a search for authenticity. At the end, he moves on to live
   his life "deliberately".

   Interwoven are the stories of many other characters, among them Otto, a
   struggling writer; Esme, a muse; and Stanley, a musician. The epilogue
   follows their stories further. In the final scene Stanley achieves his
   goal by playing his work on the organ of the church of Fenestrula
   "pulling all the stops". The church collapses, killing him, yet "most
   of his work was recovered ..., and is still spoken of, when it is
   noted, with high regard, though seldom played."

   The major part of the novel takes part in the late 1940s and early
   1950s.
