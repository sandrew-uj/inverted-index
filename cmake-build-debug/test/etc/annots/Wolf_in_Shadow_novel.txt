   Wolf in Shadow is set in the future, three hundred years after the
   "fall", an apocalyptic event of which little is initially known, but
   which is regarded in the book as an event akin to Noah's flood in which
   the world shook out of its orbit tilting it on its axis, which
   subsequently resulted in the oceans rising and destroying most of human
   civilization. Several hints are given throughout the novel that this
   catastrophe might have been due to factors such as pollution and
   nuclear weapons.

   In addition to this setting the novel employs a magic system based on
   Sipstrassi or stones of power, which are golden meteors which allow one
   to heal oneself, create food, and who are supposedly limited only by
   ones imagination, although each stone only has a certain amount of
   power, and as they are used black veins will appear upon the stone and
   grow, until eventually the Sipstrassi is coal black, and powerless.
   However, by feeding Sipstrassi blood one can refill them, although
   Sipstrassi refilled in this manner become blood red, incapable of
   healing or producing feed, good only for combat. Additionally blood
   Sipstrassi inspire darker feelings such as lust, greed, and rage in
   their wielders.
