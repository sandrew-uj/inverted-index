   Danny exacerbates a small electrical fire, altering an experimental
   crystalline semiconductor material Professor Bullfinch was evaluating.
   Prof. Bullfinch is able to use this altered material to create ISIT
   (the Invisibility Simulator with Intromittent Transmission), a
   dragonfly-like probe which could be piloted with a telepresence helmet
   and gauntlet gloves.

   The trio each tries out the device. Irene uses ISIT to birdwatch. Joe
   uses the device to observe a beehive from the inside. Danny discovers a
   bully nicknamed "Snitcher" cheating by copying the word list to the
   school spelling bee and dishonestly winning himself a boombox. The ISIT
   is outfitted with a speaker which is subsequently used by Danny as a
   means to pretend to be the bully's conscience, in order get Snitcher to
   confess to his father.

   However, ISIT also causes problems, as soon afterwards Prof. Bullfinch
   is visited by General Gruntel. The general reveals (in very
   authoritarian language) he wishes to use ISIT as a tool to spy not only
   on enemy governments, but against Americans as well. General Gruntel
   attempts to seize the unit, but is rebuffed by Doctor Grimes. While
   going to get authorization to seize the ISIT, he leaves the professor's
   lab under guard.

   Danny, Irene, and Joe decide to take matters into their own hands and
   stealthily break into the lab to recover the probe. The probe's absence
   is realized which leads to Colonel Twist, the commanding officer of the
   two guards, to delusively believe the device has been stolen by a
   foreign power. As he is being confronted by Twist, the Professor
   realizes the trio of friends are responsible. He informs Danny that
   without destroying his notes detailing the creation of ISIT, either the
   Soviet Union or the United States military could still recreate it.
   While the local National Guard arrives to secure the house against
   foreign spies, Danny and the Professor make their way to the probe's
   controls and use it to cause a fire that destroys both the notes and
   probe.

   Dr. Grimes arrives with orders from the Governor for the military
   personnel to stand down and leave the Bullfinch residence. Bullfinch
   informs Grimes that the device and his notes have been destroyed,
   leaving him the only man to remember the blueprints by memory.
   Professor Bullfinch also tells Dr. Grimes and Danny that he will not
   recreate ISIT until the world is ready for it.
