   Three astronauts in a secret spaceship lose all contact with the ground
   and observe what appears to be a nuclear exchange between the United
   States and the Soviet Union on Earth. Two months later, the
   spacecraft's guidance system is mysteriously reprogrammed, forcing the
   crew's return to Earth.

   The spacecraft lands considerably off-course, on a beach in eastern
   Nova Scotia, Canada. Jordan (Kate Lynch) is knocked unconscious on
   impact. Walker (John Walsch) exits first and is quickly killed by
   "terminals" - humans crazed by disease. Several hours later, in the
   middle of the night, Howe (Tim Choate) ventures out in search of help
   and a way to escape. He soon encounters Vinny (Maury Chaykin), a
   survivalist who has fortified his house with barbed wire and
   booby-traps. Vinny effectively saves him from the "terminals," and
   makes him his prisoner.

   As the plot develops, Vinny, fellow survivor J.J. (Lenore Zann), and
   Howe are captured, and taken in chains to a makeshift fortress built
   out of junk. In order to survive, the crew must escape to the
   radiation-free zones while avoiding cannibal "terminals" and a sadistic
   military-school student-turned-despotic ruler, and escape before a
   malfunctioning nuclear warhead explodes in sixty hours.
