   Mark Watney's route on Mars

   In 2035,^[6] the crew of NASA's Ares 3 mission have arrived at Acidalia
   Planitia for a planned month-long stay on Mars. After only six sols, an
   intense dust and wind storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent
   Vehicle (MAV), which would trap them on the planet. During the hurried
   evacuation, an antenna tears loose and impales astronaut Mark Watney, a
   botanist and engineer, also disabling his spacesuit radio. He is flung
   out of sight by the wind and presumed dead. As the MAV teeters
   dangerously, mission commander Melissa Lewis has no choice but to take
   off without completing the search for Watney.

   However, Watney is not dead. His injury proves relatively minor, but
   with no long-range radio, he cannot communicate with anyone. He must
   rely on his own resourcefulness to survive. He begins a log of his
   experiences. His philosophy is to "work the problem", solving each
   challenge in turn as it confronts him. With food a critical, though not
   immediate, problem, he begins growing potatoes in the crew's Martian
   habitat (the Hab), and burns hydrazine to generate water for the
   plants.

   NASA eventually discovers that Watney is alive when satellite images of
   the landing site show evidence of his activities; NASA personnel begin
   devising ways to rescue him, but withhold the news of his survival from
   the rest of the Ares 3 crew, on their way back to Earth aboard the
   Hermes spacecraft, so as not to distract them.

   Watney plans to drive 3,235 km (2,010 mi) to Schiaparelli crater where
   the next mission, Ares 4, will land in four years and whose MAV is
   already pre-positioned. He begins modifying one of the rovers for the
   journey, adding solar cells and an additional battery. He makes a
   three-week test drive to recover the unmanned Pathfinder lander and
   Sojourner rover and brings them back to the Hab, enabling him to
   contact NASA. Mitch Henderson, the Ares 3 flight director, convinces
   NASA Administrator Teddy Sanders to allow him to inform the Ares 3 crew
   of Watney's survival; they are thrilled, except for Lewis, who is
   guilt-stricken at leaving him behind.

   The canvas at one of the Hab airlocks tears because of Watney's
   repeated use of the same airlock, which was not designed for frequent
   and long-term usage. This results in the decompression of the Hab and
   nearly kills him. He repairs the Hab, but his plants are dead,
   threatening him again with eventual starvation. Setting aside safety
   protocols to comply with time constraints, NASA hastily prepares an
   unmanned probe to send Watney supplies, but the rocket disintegrates
   after liftoff. A deal with the China National Space Administration
   provides a ready booster--planned for use with the Taiyang Shen, an
   unmanned solar probe--to try again. With no time to build a probe with
   a soft-landing system, NASA is faced with the prospect of building a
   capsule whose cargo can survive crashing into the Martian surface at
   300 meters per second (670 mph).

   However, astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a "slingshot" trajectory
   around Earth for a gravity assist^[7] that could get Hermes back to
   Mars on a much-extended mission to save Watney, using the Chinese
   rocket booster to send a simpler resupply probe to Hermes as it passes
   Earth. Sanders vetoes the "Rich Purnell Maneuver", as it would entail
   risking the other crewmembers, but Henderson secretly emails the
   details to Hermes. All five of Watney's crewmates approve the plan.
   Once they begin the maneuver (having disabled the remote overrides),
   NASA has no choice but to support them. The resupply ship docks with
   Hermes successfully.

   Watney resumes modifying the rover because the new rescue plan requires
   him to lift off from Mars in the Ares 4 MAV. While working on the
   rover, Watney accidentally shorts out the electronics of Pathfinder,
   losing the ability to communicate with Earth (except for spelling out
   Morse code with rocks for a one-way communication).

   After Watney leaves for Schiaparelli, NASA discovers that a dust storm
   is approaching his path, but has no way to warn him. The rover's solar
   cells will be less and less able to recharge, endangering both the
   rendezvous and his immediate survival (if there is not enough power to
   run his life-support equipment). While crossing Arabia Terra, Watney
   becomes aware of the darkening sky and improvises a rough measurement
   of the storm's shape and direction of movement, enabling him to go
   around it.

   Surviving a rover rollover on his descent into Schiaparelli, Watney
   reaches the MAV and reestablishes contact with NASA. He receives
   instructions on the radical modifications necessary to reduce the MAV's
   weight to enable it to intercept Hermes during its flyby. The
   modifications include removing the front of the MAV, which Watney has
   to cover with Hab canvas. After takeoff, the canvas tears, creating
   extra drag and leaving the MAV too low for the rendezvous. Lewis
   hastily improvises a plan to intercept the MAV by firing Hermes'
   attitude thrusters and then blowing a hole in the front airlock with an
   improvised sugar-and-liquid-oxygen bomb, using the thrust from the
   escaping air to reduce speed. Beck, the Hermes' EVA specialist, uses a
   Manned Maneuvering Unit, MMU, on a tether to reach Watney and bring him
   back to Hermes. In a final log entry, Watney expresses his joy at being
   rescued, reflecting on the human instinct to help those in need.
