   During the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious
   sea monster, which, it is later suggested, might be a gigantic narwhal.
   The U.S. government assembles an expedition in New York City to find
   and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine
   biologist and the story's narrator, is in town at the time and receives
   a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. Canadian
   whaler and master harpooner Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant
   Conseil are also among the participants.

   The expedition leaves Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate
   Abraham Lincoln, then travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific
   Ocean. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates
   and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. Aronnax and
   Land are hurled into the sea, and Conseil jumps into the water after
   them. They survive by climbing onto the "monster," which, they are
   startled to find, is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of
   the vessel until morning, when they are captured, hauled inside, and
   introduced to the submarine's mysterious constructor and commander,
   Captain Nemo.

   The rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the
   Nautilus, which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the
   reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo
   seems to have a dual motivation -- a quest for scientific knowledge and
   a desire to escape terrestrial civilization. Nemo explains that his
   submarine is electrically powered and can conduct advanced marine
   research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence
   means he cannot let them leave -- they must remain on board
   permanently.

   They visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The
   travelers view coral formations, sunken vessels from the battle of Vigo
   Bay, the Antarctic ice barrier, the Transatlantic telegraph cable, and
   the legendary underwater realm of Atlantis. They even travel to the
   South Pole and are trapped in an upheaval of an iceberg on the way
   back, caught in a narrow gallery of ice from which they are forced to
   dig themselves out. The passengers also don diving suits, hunt sharks
   and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of
   Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member
   who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the Nautilus.
   When the submarine returns to the Atlantic Ocean, a school of giant
   squid ("devilfish") attacks the vessel and kills another crewman.

   The novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea
   exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a
   powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish,
   Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land.
   Ultimately, the Nautilus is attacked by a warship from the mysterious
   nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for
   revenge, Nemo -- whom Aronnax dubs an "archangel of hatred" -- rams the
   ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the
   professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his
   deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression.

   Circumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no
   longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned becomes so
   reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning,
   however, Ned announces that they are in sight of land and have a chance
   to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo,
   who now horrifies him, yet he is still drawn to the man, fears that
   Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids
   contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the
   professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish,
   "O almighty God! Enough! Enough!" Aronnax immediately joins his
   companions, and they carry out their escape plans, but as they board
   the submarine's skiff, they realize that the Nautilus has seemingly
   blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the Moskenstraumen,
   more commonly known as the "Maelstrom". Nevertheless they manage to
   escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The
   submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.
