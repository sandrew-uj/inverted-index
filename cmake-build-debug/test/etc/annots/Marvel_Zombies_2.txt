   Forty years after leaving Earth, the cosmic-powered zombies have
   systematically devoured all other life in their universe, as well as
   infected the Titan Thanos, the mutant Phoenix, Shi'ar warrior Gladiator
   and former Herald of Galactus, Firelord, with the zombie plague. They
   then decide to return to Earth and rebuild the interdimensional portal
   that Magneto destroyed forty years ago, in hope of finding more food.
   On their way to Earth, they encounter Ego the Living Planet. Surprised
   that there is a living planet, the zombies don't hesitate to devour
   him.

   On Earth, an elderly Black Panther rules the surviving humans in New
   Wakanda, but he is in a power struggle with the new generation of
   Acolytes, a team of mutant supervillains who praised Magneto, and their
   leader, Malcolm Cortez, the disillusioned son of Fabian Cortez, an old
   friend of T'Challa. An Acolyte assassin attacks the Panther in his
   sleep and nearly disembowels him, but the Panther is saved from death
   by the Wasp - who remains a zombie but who is now cured of her hunger -
   when she deliberately infects him in order to 'save' him. After
   devouring the assassin, the two struggle with how to manage their
   hunger, while the cosmic zombies continue their approach to Earth.
   During their interstellar travel back to Earth, Spider-Man and Luke
   Cage gradually lose their hunger and begin to act rationally once
   again. Giant Man wishes to start a "breeding program" to create
   more human food. A battle ensues because of Spider-Man and Luke Cage's
   new insight, knowing what they have done is wrong now that their hunger
   has subsided enough to allow them to think rationally.

   The humans erect an impenetrable barrier, with most of the
   cosmic-powered zombies outside trying to find a way in. Inside the
   barrier, Spider-Man and Luke Cage help kill Gladiator. Because of that,
   the humans gain trust in the two and repair their injuries sustained in
   the fight against gladiator (Spider-Man's ripped torso and Luke Cage's
   cybernetic lower half of body). Spider-Man then reveals that the other
   zombies seek the dimensional teleporter, which is said to be stored in
   the base. Knowing that the zombies will not depart without the device,
   the heroes prepare for the next battle. In doing so, Reynolds reveals
   that he had uncovered Colonel America's partially functioning brain and
   had spliced it into the body of T'Challa's deceased and zombified son,
   T'Channa, creating a delusional, non-hungry Colonel America. An enraged
   Black Panther attacks Reynolds for this, but soon relents upon seeing
   his edge into violence, though he refuses to forgive Reynolds for this
   transgression.

   Meanwhile, at the Baxter Building, Giant-Man and his team scour the
   building in search of the device, battling the Fantastic Four's defense
   systems, but to no avail, they cannot find it. Iron Man, having seen
   Forge in his original Iron Man armor earlier when he ransacked the
   ruins of Stark International, deduces that he must also have activated
   the defense systems inside the building and taken the portal. With this
   in mind, Giant-Man leads his team back to New Wakanda to retrieve the
   device.

   Giant-Man's team arrives outside New Wakanda, where Black Panther, Luke
   Cage, Wasp, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man are waiting. Panther offers a
   barter; handing over the device in exchange for sparing the people of
   New Wakanda. Hank and Tony agree, and the force field is lowered.
   However, they are soon double-crossed when Black Panther's team engages
   Giant-Man's in combat. Giant-Man's zombies gain the upper hand, with
   Iron Man gaining access to the human's base, preparing to feast on the
   remaining humans, only to be met by Colonel America, Forge in the
   original Iron Man armor, and the remaining Acolytes. Giant-Man and the
   remnants of his team break into the facility and attack the safe room
   holding the remaining civilians. However, as Giant-Man is about to
   feast on Black Panther's wife, Lisa, he is surprised to realize that he
   has lost his hunger. Giant-Man then convinces the zombies that
   their hunger is in fact gone, and while he is successful, they are
   interrupted by an enraged and starving Hulk. The Hulk kills several of
   the zombies (Phoenix, Firelord, Hawkeye, and Iron Man) as they attempt
   to stop him from eating the remaining humans. Reynolds, having fallen
   in love with Wasp and believing her to be dead, offers himself to be
   devoured by the Hulk to stop the Hulk's rampage, with the belief that
   he has nothing left to live for. The Hulk consumes Reynolds and then
   reverts to Banner, who requests to be killed by the survivors to
   prevent the Hulk from ever returning.

   3 weeks later, the zombies aid the remaining humans in the restoration
   and repair of New Wakanda. They then hold a memorial for Iron Man,
   Firelord, Phoenix, and Hawkeye for their sacrifices during the Hulk's
   rampage.

   Later, the zombies are called to a meeting with Malcolm to discuss
   using the inter-dimensional portal to transport the remaining humans to
   another universe. However, Malcolm reveals that he intentionally
   sabotaged the device to not work, claiming that he never wants to know
   what civilization is like and that he would enjoy ruling over New
   Wakanda alone. He then announces that he would be getting rid of the
   zombies to prevent them from getting in the way of his plans, and also
   reveals that he murdered T'Challa's son, T'Channa, and that one day, he
   would murder T'Challa's grandson. Malcolm then activates the machine
   and the zombies are hurled into another dimension.

   Forge then arrives and confronts Malcolm over his actions, only to be
   knocked unconscious by Malcolm, who proclaims that they're someone
   else's problem now.
