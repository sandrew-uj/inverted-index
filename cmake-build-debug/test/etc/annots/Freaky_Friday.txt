   A willful, disorganized teenage girl, Annabel Andrews, awakens one
   Friday morning to find herself in the body of her mother, with whom she
   had argued the previous night.

   Suddenly in charge of taking care of the New York family's affairs and
   her younger brother Ben (whom Annabel has not-so-affectionately
   nicknamed "Ape Face" and said "He's so neat, it's revolting!"), and
   growing increasingly worried about the disappearance of "Annabel", who
   appeared to be herself in the morning but has gone missing after
   leaving the Andrews' home, she enlists the help of her neighbor and
   childhood friend, Boris, though without telling him about her identity
   crisis.

   As the day wears on and Annabel has a series of increasingly bizarre
   and frustrating adventures, she becomes gradually more appreciative of
   how difficult her mother's life is, and learns, to her surprise, that
   Ben idolizes her, and Boris is actually named Morris, but has a problem
   with chronic congestion (at least around Annabel) leading him to
   nasally pronounce ms and ns as bs and ds. The novel races towards its
   climax and Ben also disappears, apparently having gone off with a
   pretty girl whom Boris did not recognize, but Ben appeared to trust
   without hesitation.

   In the climax and denouement, Annabel becomes overwhelmed by the
   difficulties of her situation, apparent disappearance of her mother,
   loss of the children, and the question of how her odd situation came
   about and when/whether it will be resolved. Finally, it is revealed
   that Annabel's mother herself caused them to switch bodies through some
   unspecified means, and the mysterious teen beauty who took Ben was Mrs.
   Andrews in Annabel's body (to which she is restored) made much more
   attractive by a makeover Mrs. Andrews gave the body while using it,
   including the removal of Annabel's braces, an appointment Annabel had
   forgotten about (and would have missed, had she been the one in her
   body that day).
