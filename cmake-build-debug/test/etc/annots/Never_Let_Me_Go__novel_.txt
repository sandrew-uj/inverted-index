   The story begins with Kathy H., who describes herself as a carer,
   talking about looking after organ donors. She has been a carer for
   almost twelve years at the time of narration, and she often reminisces
   about her time spent at Hailsham, a boarding school in England, where
   the teachers are known as guardians. The children are watched closely
   and they are often told about the importance of producing art and of
   being healthy (smoking is considered a taboo, almost on the level of a
   crime, and working in the vegetable garden is compulsory). The
   students' art is then displayed in an exhibition, and the best art is
   chosen by a woman known to the students as Madame, who keeps their work
   in a gallery. Kathy develops a close friendship with two other
   students, Ruth and Tommy. Kathy develops a fondness for Tommy, looking
   after him when he is bullied and having private talks with him.
   However, Tommy and Ruth form a relationship instead.

   In an isolated incident, Miss Lucy, one of the guardians, tells the
   students that they are clones who were created to donate organs to
   others (similar to savior siblings), and after their donations they
   will die young. Miss Lucy is removed from the school as a result of her
   disclosure, but the students passively accept their fate.

   Ruth, Tommy and Kathy move to the Cottages when they are 16 years old.
   This is the first time they are allowed in the outside world, yet they
   keep to themselves most of the time. Ruth and Tommy are still together
   and Kathy has some sexual relationships with other men. Two older
   housemates, who had not been at Hailsham, tell Ruth that they have seen
   a "possible" for Ruth, an older woman who resembles Ruth and thus could
   be the woman from whom she was cloned. As a result, the five of them go
   on a trip to see her, but the two older students first want to discuss
   a rumour they have heard: that a couple can have their donations
   deferred if they can prove that they are truly in love. They believe
   that this privilege is for Hailsham students only and so wrongly expect
   that the others will know how to apply for it. They then find the
   possible, but the resemblance to Ruth is only superficial, causing Ruth
   to wonder angrily whether they were all cloned from "human trash".

   During the trip, Kathy and Tommy separate from the others and look for
   a copy of a music tape that Kathy had lost when at Hailsham. Tommy's
   recollection of the tape and desire to find it for her make clear the
   depth of his feelings for Kathy. They find the tape, and then Tommy
   shares with Kathy a theory that the reason Madame collected their art
   was to determine which couples were truly in love, citing a teacher who
   had said that their art revealed their souls. After the trip, Kathy and
   Tommy do not tell Ruth of the found tape, nor of Tommy's theory about
   the deferral.

   When Ruth finds out about the tape and Tommy's theory, she takes an
   opportunity to drive a wedge between Tommy and Kathy. Shortly
   afterwards she tells Kathy that, even if Ruth and Tommy were to split
   up, Tommy would never enter into a relationship with Kathy because of
   her sexual history. A few weeks later, Kathy applies to become a carer,
   meaning that she will not see Ruth or Tommy for about ten years.

   After that, Ruth's first donation goes badly and her health
   deteriorates. Kathy becomes Ruth's carer, and both are aware that
   Ruth's next donation will probably be her last. Ruth suggests that she
   and Kathy take a trip and bring Tommy with them. During the trip, Ruth
   expresses regret for keeping Kathy and Tommy apart. Attempting to make
   amends, Ruth hands them Madame's address, urging them to seek a
   deferral. Shortly afterwards, Ruth makes her second donation and
   completes, an implied euphemism for dying and donating their remaining
   organs.

   Kathy becomes Tommy's carer and they form a relationship. Encouraged by
   Ruth's last wishes, they go to Madame's house to see if they can defer
   Tommy's fourth donation, bringing Tommy's artwork with him to support
   their claim that they are truly in love. They find Madame at her house,
   and also meet Miss Emily, their former headmistress, who lives with
   her. The two women reveal that guardians tried to give the clones a
   humane education, in contrast to other institutions. The gallery was a
   place meant to convey to the outside world that the clones are in fact
   normal human beings with a soul and deserve better treatment. It is
   revealed that the experiment failed, and that this is the reason
   Hailsham was closed. When Kathy and Tommy ask about the deferral they
   find out that such deferrals never existed.

   Tommy knows that his next donation will end his life, and confronts
   Kathy about her work as a carer. Kathy resigns as Tommy's carer but
   still visits him. The novel ends after Tommy's "completion", where
   Kathy, seeking a quiet life, drives up to Norfolk and briefly
   fantasizes about everything she remembers and everything she lost.
