   In the near future, Earth has established some lunar bases. High school
   senior Clifford "Kip" Russell is determined to get to the Moon, but the
   price of a ticket is far beyond his reach. His father suggest he enter
   an advertising jingle-writing contest; first prize is an
   all-expenses-paid trip there. Instead, he wins a used space suit. Kip
   puts the suit (which he names "Oscar") back into working condition.

   Kip reluctantly decides to return his space suit for a cash prize to
   help pay for college, but puts it on for one last walk. As he idly
   broadcasts on his shortwave radio, someone identifying herself as
   "Peewee" answers and requests a homing signal. He is shocked when a
   flying saucer lands practically on top of him. An 11-year-old girl
   (Peewee) and an alien being (the "Mother Thing") flee from it, but all
   three are quickly captured and taken to the Moon.

   Their kidnapper ("Wormface") is a horrible-looking creature who
   contemptuously refers to all others as "animals". Wormface has two
   human flunkies ("Fats" and "Skinny") who assisted him in initially
   capturing the Mother Thing and Peewee, a preteen genius and the
   daughter of an eminent scientist. The Mother Thing speaks in what
   sounds like birdsong (illustrated by a few musical notations), but Kip
   and Peewee have no trouble understanding her.

   Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing escape and try to reach the nearest
   human base on foot, but they are recaptured and taken to a base on
   Pluto. Kip is thrown into a cell, later to be joined by Fats and
   Skinny, who have apparently outlived their usefulness. After Skinny is
   taken away, Fats tells Kip that his former employers eat humans, before
   he himself disappears.

   The Mother Thing, meanwhile, makes herself useful to their captors by
   constructing advanced devices for them. She manages to steal enough
   parts to assemble a bomb and a transmitter. The bomb takes care of all
   but one of the Wormfaces, and between them, Kip and Peewee deal with
   the last one. The Mother Thing freezes solid when she tries to set up
   the transmitter outside without a spacesuit. Kip puts Oscar on and
   activates the beacon, but becomes severely frostbitten in the extreme
   cold. Help arrives quickly. Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing are
   transported to Vega 5, the Mother Thing's home planet.

   Kip is kept in a state of cryopreservation while the Mother Thing's
   people figure out how to heal him. It turns out that the Mother Thing
   is far hardier than Kip had suspected and freezing did not hurt her.
   While Kip recuperates, a Vegan anthropologist Kip nicknames "Joe"
   learns about Earth from Peewee and Kip. Once Kip is well, he, Peewee,
   and the Mother Thing travel to a planet in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud,
   to face an intergalactic tribunal, composed of many advanced species
   which have banded together for self-protection.

   The Wormfaces are put on trial first. Their representatives are so
   arrogantly xenophobic that they promise to destroy the "animals" who
   dared to try the "Only People", and are judged to be dangerous. Their
   planet is to be "rotated" 90DEG out of the present space-time ...
   without their star - most likely dooming them to freezing to death.

   Then it is humanity's turn, as represented by Peewee, Kip, Iunio (an
   ancient Roman centurion), and a Neanderthal man. The Neanderthal is
   rejected as being of another species. Iunio proves belligerent, but
   brave. Peewee's and Kip's recorded remarks are then admitted into
   evidence. In humanity's defense, Kip makes an impassioned speech. The
   Mother Thing and a representative of another race argue that the
   short-lived species are essentially children who should be granted more
   time to learn and grow. It is decided to re-evaluate humanity after "a
   dozen half-deaths of radium" (19200 years).

   Kip and Peewee are returned to Earth with advanced alien devices and
   scientific equations provided by the Vegans to help the human race. Kip
   passes the information along to Professor Reisfeld, Peewee's father.
   Reisfeld arranges a full scholarship for Kip at the Massachusetts
   Institute of Technology, where Kip wants to study engineering and
   spacesuit design.
