   Young Wizards is a series of novels by Diane Duane.

   The Young Wizards series presently consists of eleven books, focusing
   on the adventures of two young wizards named Nita and Kit. Each novel
   pits Nita and Kit against the "Lone Power", an entity ultimately bent
   on the destruction of the entire universe. The series began in 1983
   with the book So You Want to Be a Wizard, which told the story of their
   first experiences with wizardry. In 1997, Duane began a spin-off, the
   Feline Wizards series, which takes place in the same universe, but with
   different protagonists.

   This series incorporates elements of fantasy, science fiction, and
   religion. The series deals with issues such as death, sacrifice, and
   redemption.
