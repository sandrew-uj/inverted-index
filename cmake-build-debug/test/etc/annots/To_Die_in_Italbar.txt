   Heidel von Hymack, known to all as "H", is a man with the power to cure
   people of incurable diseases. He travels from world to world healing
   people by touching them. However his healing powers have a dark side:
   after a while they reverse and he becomes a spreader of deadly
   diseases. Avoiding contact with others is almost impossible because of
   his celebrity, so his most dedicated followers tend to die horribly. He
   does not know why he has this power, though he dreams of a mysterious
   "Lady" who rules his life. In fact he has been accidentally joined to a
   deity of the Pei'an religion, a goddess of disease and healing whose
   changing moods determine whether he saves or kills. The only other
   human so joined is Francis Sandow, a man of incalculable wealth who
   builds planets. Sandow was introduced in the novel Isle of the Dead. To
   escape his fate, "H" must go with Sandow and others to the devastated
   remains of the Earth, destroyed in a recent war, where Sandow engages
   in a duel of powers to drive out the goddess.

   Elsewhere, Malacar Miles is the last holdout on Earth, the last bastion
   of the old regime and an obstacle to Sandow and other world builders
   who want to make the planet habitable again. Part of Sandow's mission
   is to remove the obstacle Malacar presents.
