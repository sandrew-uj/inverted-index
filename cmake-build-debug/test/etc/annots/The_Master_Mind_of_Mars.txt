   In this novel Burroughs shifts the focus of the series for the second
   time, the first having been from early protagonists John Carter and
   Dejah Thoris to their children after the third book. Now he moves to a
   completely unrelated hero, Ulysses Paxton, an Earthman like Carter who
   like him is sent to Mars by astral projection.
   Original 1927 magazine publication

   On Mars, Paxton is taken in by elderly mad scientist Ras Thavas, the
   "Master Mind" of the title, who educates him in the ways of Barsoom and
   bestows on him the Martian name Vad Varo. Ras has perfected techniques
   of transplanting brains, which he uses to provide rich elderly Martians
   with youthful new bodies for a profit. Distrustful of his fellow
   Martians, he trains Paxton as his assistant to perform the same
   operation on him. But Paxton has fallen in love with Valla Dia, one of
   Ras' young victims, whose body has been swapped for that of the hag
   Xaxa, Jeddara (empress) of the city-state of Phundahl. He refuses to
   operate on Ras until his mentor promises to restore her to her rightful
   body. A quest for that body ensues, in which Paxton is aided by others
   of Ras' experimental victims, and in the end he attains the hand of his
   Valla Dia, who in a happy plot twist turns out to be a princess.
