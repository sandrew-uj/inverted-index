   Upon publication of the obituary for Matthew A. Sobol, a brilliant
   computer programmer and CTO of Cyberstorm Entertainment, a Daemon is
   activated. Sobol, dying of brain cancer, was fearful for humanity and
   began to envision a new world order. The Daemon becomes his tool to
   achieve that vision. The Daemon's first mission is to kill two
   programmers Joseph Pavlos & Chopra Singh who worked for CyberStorm
   Entertainment and unknowingly helped in the creation of the Daemon.

   The program secretly takes over hundreds of companies and provides
   financial and computing resources for recruiting real world agents and
   creating AutoM8s (computer controlled driverless cars, used as
   transport and occasionally as weapons), Razorbacks (sword-wielding
   robotic riderless motorcycles, specifically designed as weapons) and
   other devices. The Daemon also creates a secondary online web service,
   hidden from the general public, dubbed the Darknet, which allows Daemon
   operatives to exchange information freely. Daemon implements a kind of
   government by algorithm inside the community of its recruited
   operatives.^[1]

   What follows is a series of interlocking stories following the main
   characters:

   Detective Pete Sebeck is called in to investigate the death of Pavlos.
   However, when a connection is made between the two programmers and
   Cyberstorm, the FBI takes over led by Agent Decker. For being the first
   authority figure in the investigation, the Daemon selects Sebeck
   against his will to serve the Daemon, which frames Sebeck for its
   creation as a multi-million scheme and a hoax. The US government,
   though knowing the truth, fasttracks Sebeck's trial and executes him
   eight months later. Sebeck makes peace with his wife, who loves him
   despite the fact that Sebeck is having an affair, but his son Chris
   remains estranged, and he proclaims his innocence while dying from
   lethal injection. However, Sebeck later awakens to learn that the
   Daemon faked his death and assigned him the task to prove that humanity
   deserves its freedom from the Daemon. Joined by a fellow operative
   named Laney Price, Sebeck vanishes into America.

   Jon Ross, a Russian hacker and identity thief, is questioned by the FBI
   and brought into the investigation by Sebeck. Unfortunately,
   traditional investigation methods are useless against Sobol's Daemon
   program. Ross eventually deduces that the Daemon can anticipate their
   every move, seemingly one step ahead of anyone who tries to interfere
   with its operation. Even after being named in the Daemon hoax (and put
   on the FBI's most wanted list), Ross willingly helps the US government
   to stop the program. Assigned to the NSA's anti-Daemon task force, with
   Agent Phillips, he is a firsthand witness to Loki's attack on the
   installation and barely survives the massacre that follows. With his
   immunity deal rescinded, he vanishes underground with the intent on
   destroying the Daemon on his own.

   Agent Roy "Tripwire" Merritt a decorated FBI agent is brought in to
   secure Sobol's property, when several FBI agents and police officers
   are killed by an automated Hummer that attacks anyone who approaches. A
   longtime military officer and expert in hostage situations, he realizes
   that Sobol's estate is a death trap and red herring, but fear of the
   Daemon forces his hand and his team is ordered to secure the site
   regardless. His team is quickly killed, and he remains the lone
   survivor, infiltrating the house and accidentally triggering a bomb,
   which levels the property. Blamed for the failure, he is relieved of
   duty but is later brought onto the anti-Daemon task force by the Major.
   When Loki is revealed to have infiltrated the building, Roy pursues
   him, against orders. Fearful of the publicity that the chase will
   generate, the Major kills Roy himself. Despite being an enemy to the
   Daemon, he becomes a folk hero of the Darknet, known as "The Burning
   Man" by the Darknet users, who respect him for his tenacity.

   NSA Agent Natalie Philips, a genius workaholic government
   cryptographer. Phillips joins the investigation shortly after the FBI
   is called in. Eventually, she is placed in charge of the anti-Daemon
   task force, but she finds plenty of interference from the Major. She is
   attracted to Jon Ross (the attraction is mutual), but she quickly
   states that national security will take precedence and their
   relationship will remain professional. Phillips objects to the murder
   of Sebeck to protect infected corporate systems from the Daemon's
   wrath. One of a handful survivors from Loki's attack, Phillips is
   blamed for the failure and relieved of duties.

   Brian Gragg aka "Loki Stormbringer" is a sociopathic loner and avid
   gamer. He makes a living through identity theft and other cyber crimes.
   After running afoul of some hackers from the Philippines, he allows his
   partner in crime, Jason Heider, to be killed in his place. Needing to
   lie low, Loki is recruited by the Daemon by outthinking a hidden game
   level in one of Sobol's games. Loki is the first Daemon operative and
   quickly becomes one of the most powerful operatives. His behavior,
   though useful to the Daemon, is hated and feared even by other Darknet
   members. His first major act is to infiltrate the anti-Daemon task
   force. When found out, he quickly triggers an attack, which leaves most
   of the people and agents there dead. He is pursued by Roy Merritt, as
   he escapes and witnesses the Major executing Roy, vowing to kill the
   Major for betraying his own man.

   The Major, unnamed throughout the series, is introduced as a secret DOD
   liaison assigned to the daemon task force. Soon, everyone who
   encounters him realizes that his history is checkered, and his loyalty
   remains with the military-industrial complex now under attack by the
   Daemon. When Loki massacres the task force, he quickly contains the
   situation by destroying all evidence (including leveling the building)
   and personally executing Roy Merritt, fearful that Merritt's pursuit of
   Loki will attract too much attention. Realizing that they have
   underestimated the Daemon and its network, the Major retreats and
   prepares to wage a secret war against the Daemon and its agents.

   Anji Anderson is a recently fired reporter, whose good looks have
   hindered her career for years. Having been relegated to fluff pieces
   and put on the air to be pretty, she is quickly recruited as a Daemon
   operative, her job to investigate stories that benefit the Daemon and
   help push its propaganda. Her main effect in the story is to help frame
   Sebeck. She eventually becomes the spokesman for the Daemon.

   Charles Mosely is a former drug dealer and convicted killer recruited
   by the Daemon, which helps him to escape prison by transferring him
   first to minimum security and then releasing him altogether. With a new
   identity, he travels to a Daemon-controlled office where he is
   interrogated by the Daemon's AI and is deemed acceptable to serve. He
   eventually becomes a security operative, assigned jobs such as
   executing criminals, participating a massive worldwide assassination of
   spammers who corrupt the internet. Mosley's only request is for the
   Daemon to locate his missing son and protect him. Ray is both found and
   sent to live with Daemon agents, who will raise and educate Ray in a
   safe family-like setting.
