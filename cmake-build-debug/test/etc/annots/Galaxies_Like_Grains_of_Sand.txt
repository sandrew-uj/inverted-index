   Aldiss describes historical time as "a treacherous mirror, reflecting
   only our limited truths." The mirror reflecting the forty-million year
   history of the City of New Union has been shattered and the book
   presents only a handful of its shards. A brief introduction ties each
   story to the previous one:
     * "Three's a Cloud" - Mildly drunk, Clemperer wanders into a
       restaurant in the seaside town into which he has washed up. The
       restaurant is nearly empty, but Clemperer sits down with the two
       other occupants and starts a conversation. He feels an odd gestalt
       with them, one that persists as a storm rages over Union Bay.
       Believing his new friends drowned, he goes to the restaurant and
       finds them, soaking wet, waiting for him.
     * "All the World's Tears" - On the last day of summer at the end of
       the 83rd Century (AD 8300 Dec 18), in a war-exhausted world in
       which people avoid direct contact, J. Smithlao goes to Charles
       Gunpat's estate to give the old man a hate brace in preparation for
       a meeting. As his sneering comments about Gunpat's mutant daughter
       goad the man into a screaming rage, Smithlao witnesses an incident
       that will offer excellent material for the next time he is called
       to give Charles Gunpat a hate brace.
     * "Who Can Replace a Man?" - One day the robots working on a vast
       farm receive no orders from the city. They are informed that the
       humans are extinct. Guided by the most intelligent of them, the
       robots begin planning to create a glorious robot civilization, free
       of human domination. Then they encounter a lone human.
     * "Blighted Profile" - Chun Hwa rides his horse along the rim of one
       of the last burnt-over remnants of ancient radiation wars. His
       grandchildren's generation is planning a great city on Union Bay
       and he wants to go to the future to gather evidence that it is a
       mistake. A wild boy tells Chun Hwa that he has found a time machine
       such as the old man desires and Chun Hwa follows his heart.
     * "Judas Danced" - In the city of Union, Alexander Abel Ybo has been
       sentenced to death for the second time for murdering Parowen
       Scryban for the second time. In a world where people view history
       through timescreens and express their feelings about it through
       interpretive dance, he is an outcast. Even though he looks like
       Jesus Christ, his club foot prevents him from dancing the Passion,
       so he murders his twin, who does.
     * "O, Ishrail!" - Aboard the mental-health ship Cyberqueen, anchored
       in the harbor of New Union, Davi Dael pleads the case of a man
       called Ishrail. The man was found naked on a farm and claims to be
       an exile from a galaxy-wide civilization. No one on Earth has heard
       of such a civilization, though records, likely myths, indicate that
       some ships attempted to cross interstellar space millennia before.
       Ishrail is declared insane and Davi recognizes the exquisite
       cruelty of the people who exiled him.
     * "Incentive" - A bit over a decade after Ishrail's exile began, the
       Galactics have come to Earth and established an embassy in New
       Union. Farro Westerby has gone to that embassy to confront
       Jandanagger Laterobinson and try to discern the real reason that
       Earth is being admitted into the Galactic Federation. Jandanagger
       acquaints Farro with the Galactics' immaterialist understanding of
       Reality and notes that Earth is being drawn into the Federation as
       an act of psychotherapy, an exorcising of monsters from the Id.
     * "Gene-Hive" - A nuclear accident triggers a change in one man's
       body, making one of his cells sentient. The rogue cell renders
       other cells sentient and transforms the man into a shapeshifter,
       the next stage in the evolution of life. The man begins to absorb
       other people and when unaffected humans approach him with atomic
       weapons, he merges with a mass migration of butterflies and
       vanishes.
     * "Secret of a Mighty City" - In a projection room of Supernova
       Studios Harsch Benlin pitches to Smile P. Wreyermeyer an idea for a
       3-D movie about the City of Nunion itself. It is an exploration of
       the city's decadence with its undertone of squalor, a search for
       the heart and soul of the greatest city in the Galaxy. Of course,
       the final product looks nothing like what Harsch Benlin pitched. It
       does not even mention the destitute artist who conceived it.
     * "They Shall Inherit" - Representing Transfederation Health, Citizen
       Djjckett Male has come to the Experimental Applied Mutation
       Hospital to confer with Moderator Tedden Male regarding experiments
       aimed at advancing human development. Djjckett, whose own people
       make and use creatures that are part robot and part animal, claims
       that artificial mutation of humans is monstrous. The mutants seem
       to agree.
     * "Visiting Amoeba" - An itinerant peddler strays beyond the Galaxy
       and must land on a nearby planet to replenish his ship's oxygen
       supply. Although the instruments say that the world is safe, the
       air kills him just as a manlike creature emerges from a lake. After
       absorbing all knowledge from the peddler's ship and library, the
       creature flies the ship back into the Galaxy, raises an invasion
       fleet, and heads for Earth. In the fabulous city of Nion, the
       creature tells the Supreme Suzerain that matter has grown tired:
       exhausted, it is beginning to collapse back into the nothingness
       whence it came, making room for a new creation.
