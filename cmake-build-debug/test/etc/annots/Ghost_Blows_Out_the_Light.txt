   Ghost Blows Out the Light (Chinese: ; pinyin: Gui Chuideng), also
   referred to as Candle in the Tomb, is a fantasy novel series written by
   Zhang Muye [zh] () about a team of grave robbers seeking hidden
   treasure, with the first book published online in March 2006.^[1] It
   quickly became the bestselling online novel in China with an estimated
   readership of six million,^[2] and when published in print form in
   October the same year,^[3]^[4] went on to sell over 500,000 copies,^[1]
   although the book had to be rewritten to remove references to the
   supernatural before it could be released.^[5]

   Set in the 1980s, the series follows former soldier Hu Bayi and his
   partner as they raid tombs in search of valuables.^[3] The two team up
   with an American archaeologist after they fall victim to a curse, and
   to release themselves from it they must seek clues found among ancient
   mythical sites across China.^[3]

   The title is derived from an old Chinese saying, credited by the author
   to genuine grave robbers: "A human lights the candle and the ghosts
   blow it out."^[3]^[4] According to Muye, grave robbers would place a
   candle in the south-east corner of a tomb after entering, in an attempt
   to make contact with the dead. If the candle was extinguished it was a
   sign that the spirits within opposed the intrusion, and the robbers
   would be obliged to depart, leaving everything intact and
   undisturbed.^[3]^[4]
