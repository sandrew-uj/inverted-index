   The story is set in a post-disaster, dystopian future city, appearing
   to be somewhere in the United States, called the Urb, which has been
   disturbed by an earthquake known as "The Big Shake." The Urb is plagued
   by poverty, thieves, gang warfare, and the use of mind probes. Mind
   probes are analogous to hard drugs and enable users to temporarily
   escape their harsh lives through images like movies being played in
   their heads. Genetically improved people, called "proovs," (A play on
   "improved") live in a city called Eden, with a beautiful society, food,
   and water. Eden is separated from the Urb by the "Forbidden Zone," a
   deadly and dangerous minefield. The Urb is split up into sections
   called "latches." Each latch is controlled by a gang. Spaz is a teenage
   boy who cannot use mind probes because of his epilepsy and whose
   adoptive family has abandoned him because they feared the symptoms of
   his illness. Spaz runs errands for Billy Bizmo, the latch-boss (leader)
   of his gang, the "Bully Bangers," in a section of the Urb. On one of
   his errands, Spaz is sent to "rip-off" (steal from) Ryter, a very old
   man who possesses the lost arts of literacy and literature.

   Spaz soon meets Little Face, a five-year-old orphan who only says the
   word "chox," because he didn't learn how to speak and Spaz first gave
   him choxbars to eat. Spaz also meets Lanaya, a proov who charitably
   gives out "edibles" (food) to Spaz. At first, Spaz is very hostile
   towards Ryter, when Spaz arrives to "rip off" (steal) Ryter's meager
   possessions. Contrastingly, Ryter understands Spaz's situation and does
   his best to help him, offering no resistance. Eventually, Spaz learns
   that Bean, his beloved adoptive sister, is dying of leukemia. Ryter and
   Little Face accompany Spaz on a journey to find Bean. The trio starts
   by traveling through "The Pipe," a large, rusted-out water pipe that
   leads to other latches. In the next latch, the group sees everything
   burning and find Lanaya being attacked by very hungry people. She is
   rescued by Spaz and Ryter, and she joins them on their journey. Spaz
   and the company start traveling towards the latch where Bean lives.
   Eventually, through many dangers, toils, and snares, the story's heroes
   find a dying Bean. Lanaya and Ryter decide to take Bean to Eden, along
   with Spaz and Little Face. They ride along in Lanaya's takvee to her
   "contributors" (parents), Jin and Bree's home, which is a castle in
   Eden.

   At this point in the novel, it is brought to attention that Lanaya is a
   special proov who has been bred to eventually become a Master of Eden.
   To assume this title, she has rights and privileges that other proovs
   do not, called "learning opportunities". They take Bean to a proov
   hospital called the Primary and she is cured of her sickness using gene
   therapy. Ryter, Spaz and Little Face enjoy the paradise of Eden.
   Sometime later Ryter, Spaz and Bean are thrown out of Eden because the
   elders who rule over Eden decide they are unacceptable. Little Face is
   secretly adopted by Lanaya's contributors. The elders disregard Bean's
   high intelligence. They presume that someone from the Urb could never
   naturally be better than a proov in any way. Lanaya reveals to the
   elders that the mind probes, which come from Eden, cause too much
   damage to the people who use them in the Urb. As a result, all the mind
   probes throughout the Urb are deactivated, causing rioting and anarchy
   outside Eden. Bean is deposited at her home, and Ryter and Spaz are
   returned to their latch.

   Back at Spaz's home latch, Ryter is blamed for the deactivation of the
   mind probes and is wheeled by jetbikes which kills the old man. The
   stress caused by this assault triggered an epileptic seizure for Spaz.
   Before his death, Ryter tells Spaz that he is the last book in the
   universe. Billy Bizmo reveals to Spaz that he is his biological father
   and that his mother died at Spaz's birth.

   The story ends with Lanaya sending Spaz a message about things getting
   better in Eden and how she believes they can fix everything in time.
   Spaz takes on the name Ryter, continuing the original Ryter's work,
   writing The Last Book in the Universe.
