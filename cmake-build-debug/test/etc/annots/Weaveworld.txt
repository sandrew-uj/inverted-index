   Decades prior to the book's opening, a magical race known as the
   Seerkind combined all of their powers to create a secret world known as
   "the Fugue", a carpet into which they wove their most beloved
   locations, animals, possessions and themselves as a safe haven. Their
   aim was to avoid persecution by humans (who call them demons and
   fairies) and eradication by a destructive being known as the Scourge.
   This creature's nature is entirely unknown to the Seerkind, as no-one
   has survived to describe it. The Fugue, resembling an ordinary, albeit
   exquisitely woven, carpet is left in the care of a normal woman, Mimi
   Laschenski, who married one of the Seerkind and resides in Liverpool,
   England.

   Mimi reaches old age and is hospitalised following a stroke. A young
   man named Calhoun Mooney, chasing an escaped homing pigeon,
   accidentally glimpses the Fugue hidden in the carpet, which profoundly
   affects him. Simultaneously, Mimi's granddaughter Suzanna Parrish,
   arrives in the city at Mimi's behest. The mystery surrounding Mimi and
   the full potential of the carpet brings Cal and Suzanna together and
   quickly into confrontation with the primary antagonists: Immacolata, an
   exiled and extremely powerful Seerkind bent on revenge; Shadwell, a
   human salesman with limitless ambition; and Hobart, a conscientious
   policeman.

   Cal and Suzanna acquire new allies and abilities in their goal of
   protecting the Fugue from destruction, venturing into it themselves
   twice. When Shadwell's actions result in the Fugue's seemingly total
   obliteration, the surviving Seerkind scatter. In a last desperate
   attempt to finish them, Shadwell locates and awakens the Scourge, which
   begins systematically destroying any and all traces of magic it can
   find.

   Cal, Suzanna and their remaining allies make a final stand against
   Shadwell by using his own tactics against him and convince the Scourge
   to abandon its cause and leave the planet in peace. In the aftermath, a
   severely traumatised Cal is cared for by Suzanna whilst their friends
   adjust to permanent life amongst humanity. Eventually, Cal emerges from
   his withdrawal with the knowledge of how the Fugue is still alive and
   can be restored to its full glory.
