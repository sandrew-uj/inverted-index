   Set in the year 2145 in a post-apocalyptic and unrecognisable London,
   The Drowned World is a setting of tropical temperatures, flooding and
   accelerated evolution.^[4]

   The Earth went back to its Paleozoic era sixty or seventy years before
   the novel began. There are two main causes of the flood, both unrelated
   to humans' activity on the planet. First, a series of sudden violent
   and prolonged solar storms lasting several years enlarged the Van Allen
   belts and diminished the Earth's gravitational hold upon the outer
   layers of the ionosphere. As a result, the Earth remained unprotected
   from solar radiation and temperature climbed steadily making it all a
   tropical zone. Cities around the Equator were abandoned as temperature
   reached 100 degrees (Ballard never mentions if these are Celsius or
   Fahrenheit). Second, the continued heating of the atmosphere melted the
   polar ice-caps and the contours of the continents were reshaped: in
   Europe the Mediterranean became a system of inland lakes and the
   British Isles were linked to France. In North America, the Mississippi
   basin became an enormous gulf opening into the Hudson Bay and the
   Caribbean was transformed into a silt desert.

   Only one city is mentioned in the novel, Camp Byrd (pop. 10,000),
   Greenland, and only five million people are estimated to live on the
   polar caps. Birth of mammals has been drastically reduced, for humans
   only one couple in ten yields any offspring. On the other hand,
   reptilians and amphibians rapidly reproduce across the planet; as the
   novel develops once rare albino iguanas, alligators, and serpents
   become more common.

   Ballard's story follows the biologist Dr Robert Kerans and his
   struggles against the devolutionary impulses of the environment. As
   part of a scientific survey unit under the leadership of Colonel Riggs,
   sent to map the flora and fauna in the boiling lagoon, the tranquility
   and banality of their role is soon upset by the onset of strange dreams
   which increasingly plague the survivors' minds. Amidst talk of the army
   and scientific team moving north, Lieutenant Hardman, the only other
   commissioned member of the unit, flees the lagoon and instead heads
   south, a search team unable to stop his escape.

   When the other inhabitants of the lagoon finally flee the searing sun
   and head north, Kerans and two associates, the beautiful but reclusive
   Beatrice Dahl and fellow scientist Dr Alan Bodkin, settle down in the
   swamp into an isolated existence. Kerans is still tormented by his
   psycho-analytical tendencies, ever analysing and debating the
   regression of the environment into a neo-Triassic period, but the brief
   quiet is ended by the arrival of Strangman. The leader of a team of
   pirates seeking out and looting treasures within the deep, Strangman
   defies the remaining civilised reasons of Kerans' mind and disrupts the
   world that the survivors have grown to know. When Strangman and his
   team drain the lagoon and expose the city beneath, both Kerans and
   Bodkin are disgusted; the latter attempts to blow up the flood defences
   and re-flood the area, but without success. With Kerans and Beatrice
   resigned to their fate, Strangman pursues Bodkin and kills him in
   revenge.

   Strangman and his team grow tired and suspicious of Dr Kerans, and with
   Beatrice now under Strangman's web of control, Kerans is imprisoned and
   subjected to bizarre and tribalistic rituals intended to kill him. He
   survives, although severely weakened by the ordeals, and attempts to
   save Beatrice from her own imprisonment, to little avail. With the
   doctor and Beatrice facing the guns of Strangman and his men, the army
   under Colonel Riggs returns to save them at the last moment. With no
   reason or evidence to prosecute Strangman, the authorities co-operate
   with him, and Kerans once more grows frustrated by the inaction,
   finally taking a stand and succeeding in re-flooding the lagoon where
   Bodkin had failed. Wounded and weak, the doctor flees the lagoon and
   heads south without aim, meeting the frail and blind figure of Hardman
   along the way. After he aids Hardman back to some amount of strength,
   he soon continues onwards on his travels south, with little idea of an
   aim or objective, a "second Adam searching for the forgotten paradises
   of the reborn sun".
