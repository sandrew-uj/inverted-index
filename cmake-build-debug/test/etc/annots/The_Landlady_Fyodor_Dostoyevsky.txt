   After the reclusive and bookish scholar Vasily Ordynov is compelled to
   leave his apartment he wanders aimlessly through Saint Petersburg,
   contemplating his despair over a loveless life, his childhood and his
   future. Through this distraction he finds himself within a church,
   where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina.
   His fascination for the couple, particularly Katerina, causes him to
   contrive further encounters, with the intention of securing a lodging
   at their home. He becomes their house guest. The gloomy Murin is a
   perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed
   his neighbours and the local police, and which appear to control his
   wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, that she
   might be Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off
   together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion
   that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiance during their
   escape.

   Ordynov develops a passion for Katerina, which she reciprocates after
   nursing him through delirium. While in delirium Ordynov, in dream
   or reality, spies on Murin who has taken to his bed through illness and
   is recounting tales to Katerina - he rushes into Murin's room; Murin's
   attempt to shoot Ordynov with a gun, misses. Ordynov tries to convince
   Katerina of her need to detach herself from Murin physically and
   psychologically, and believes he has overcome her reluctance to do so
   when he hears her sing a song of love and freedom. Katerina offers wine
   to Ordynov and Murin as she considers her choice. Murin uses the
   language of prediction and psychology to show any choice as futile, as
   Katerina is predestined by her sex to be a captive of a master and her
   own grief. Ordynov now fully believes that Murin is a sorcerer and that
   Katerina is his slave, as she herself believes. Using Murin's argument,
   he offers to buy Katerina, to effect her liberation. Murin indicates a
   veiled threat that the price would be bloodshed for both buyer and
   goods. Fearing a lost cause, Ordynov intends to kill Murin, but fails
   as a knife falls from his hand and as Katerina falls at her husband's
   feet.

   Murin afterwards explains to the police that both Katerina and Ordynov
   are weak and would hand back freedom if it were given; that she needs
   the control of a master, and he couldn't kill a stronger man even with
   the means to do so.
