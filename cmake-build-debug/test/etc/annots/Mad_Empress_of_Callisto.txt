   Jonathan Dark (Jandar) is now well settled into his new life as husband
   of Princess Darloona of Shondakar on the Jovian moon of Callisto (or
   Thanator). While out hunting with some companions they are kidnapped in
   a balloon by a force from the rival city of Tharkol. Their capture is
   part of a plot by Zamorra, empress of Tharkol, who under the mental
   influence of her advisor, the Mind Wizard Ang Chan is making an attempt
   to conquer all of Thanator.

   Sprung from her dungeon by the thief Glypto, Jandar and his companions
   kidnap Zamorra and escape in the balloon. However, their craft is later
   attacked and brought down by a Ghastosar (a Thantorian flying creature
   resembling a pterodactyl), and the group falls into the hands of the
   insect-like Yathoon nomads. Once again Glypto is the key to their
   escape.

   Striking out for Shondakar on foot, they encounter a caravan from the
   Soroba, only to find it a front for a military expedition from that
   city. They are rescued from the Sorobans by an airship, which they
   assume to be from Shondakar--but it is a Tharkolian ship, another unit
   in Zamorra's new airfleet.

   The empress having gradually proven to be a decent sort during the
   party's adventures, Darloona tries to talk her out of her mad scheme.
   Discovering she has been controlled by Ang Chan, Zamorra is persuaded,
   and the upshot is a new alliance against the Mind Wizards made up of
   Tharkol, Shondakar and Soroba (ably represented by Glypto, now revealed
   to have been a Soroban spy).
