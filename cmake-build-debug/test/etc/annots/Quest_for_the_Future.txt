   The protagonist of the novel is Peter Caxton, a physics teacher who, as
   in the story "Film Library", rents films for his school. He takes the
   movie projector, that seems to be changing the intended films into
   films from the future, home for investigation.

   Caxton, then waking in hospital, is the amnesiac traveling salesman
   from the story "The Search"; he goes back over his sales territory to
   discover what happened. He meets Selanie, who is selling gadgets from
   the future, and her father Claudan Johns; they are time travelers, and
   he discovers their motor home that contains the gadgets.

   He is transported into the year 2083 by a handshake from a rival time
   traveler. There he sees inventions from the films he rented, and he
   explores an enormous building; after sleeping he wakes up by an older
   version of Selanie, to whom he seems to be married. He meets Price, who
   explains that the building is the Palace of Immortality, which Claudan
   Johns discovered, and which is used for time travel; the time travelers
   are known as Possessors. A handshake from Price sends Caxton back to
   his original time.

   In an attempt to return to 2083, he joins an expedition to travel to
   nearby star Alpha Centauri, as in the story "Far Centaurus". His
   intention is to turn the spaceship round during a waking interval
   between periods of hibernation, and so return to Earth at the right
   time; but when he wakes after 50 years, he finds it is not possible.
   Arriving at Alpha Centauri, the crew are received by the advanced
   civilization from Earth that can make the journey in three hours, and
   have long been expecting them. They are shown round Alpha Centauri, and
   around Earth. Caxton, still interested in his old sales territory,
   there meets Kameel Bustaman; he is a Possessor, and sends Caxton back
   to the 20th century.

   Possessors Johns and Bustaman, and Possessor Daniel Magoelson who
   becomes important later, are trying to increase their ability to travel
   through time, as they learn to deal with probability worlds and time
   foldbacks. Caxton, caught up in this activity, makes further time
   shifts, and the story becomes increasingly complex. There is an
   interval where Caxton travels with Selanie and Johns in their motor
   home, in the North America of 1650, during which Johns discusses time
   travel.

   The movie projector's special qualities were created by Johns and
   Magoelson, in an attempt to create an imbalance in a time foldback; the
   attempt was unexpectedly affected by the presence of Bustaman watching
   the film, who at that time was not aware he was a Possessor, and
   wrecked by Caxton's dismantling of the projector.

   During the time traveling, two versions of Caxton and of Selanie are
   created. At the end, these versions are merged, and Selanie, resolving
   their relationship, says, "I can't marry you because the me that I
   merged with, is already married to you, remember?"
