   With Darken Rahl defeated, Richard and Kahlan head back to the Mud
   People to be married. As they wait for their wedding day to approach,
   they discover three Sisters of Light are pursuing Richard, intending to
   take him back to the Old World to be trained as a Wizard. Additionally,
   unbeknownst to Richard and Kahlan, the veil has been torn and the Stone
   of Tears has entered the world. According to prophecy, the only person
   who has a chance at closing the veil is the one bonded to the blade,
   the one born true.

   After the death of Darken Rahl and planning his wedding to Kahlan,
   Richard is afflicted by a series of painful headaches. He also learns
   from Shota that he is the bastard son of Darken Rahl and the grandson
   (on his mother's side) of Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

   Richard gets a visit from three Sisters of the Light (Sisters Grace,
   Elizabeth and Verna), who inform him that his headaches are caused by
   the awakening of the gift within him and are fatal and unstoppable,
   unless he receives magical training. The Sisters tell him that he must
   go with them and wear a Rada'Han, a magical collar, in order to control
   his headaches and the gift. They also explain that they will offer him
   their help three times, and, if he refuses each time, they will not be
   able to help him ever again. Richard refuses twice, and each time a
   Sister commits suicide.

   Seeking guidance on how to repair the veil, Richard and Kahlan request
   another "gathering"; this involves turning to the "ancestors' spirits"
   for help. But instead of being able to speak to the spirits, Richard
   and Kahlan are sent down to the underworld and are placed face-to-face
   with Darken Rahl. Rahl touches Richard with the Keeper's mark, making
   him unconscious and lets Kahlan know that Richard is only minutes away
   from death.

   As Kahlan desperately tries to save Richard, a glowing spirit emerges,
   Denna, who tells Kahlan that she has to force Richard into wearing the
   collar; if he does not, the headaches will kill him and everything will
   be lost. Denna then takes Richard's mark, and is sent down to the
   underworld and the Keeper. As the third and final Sister returns,
   Kahlan tells Richard that he has to put on the collar. When he tries to
   explain his reluctance, Kahlan makes him believe that the only way to
   prove his love for her is to wear it. Richard reluctantly agrees to
   wear the collar and the sister reveals to them that the third reason
   for wearing the collar is to inflict pain on the wearer. He leaves,
   telling her merely to find Zedd. Devastated, Richard submits to the
   remaining Sister, and leaves with her to go to the Palace of Prophets.

   Richard travels with Sister Verna to the Palace of the Prophets, which
   is located in the Old World. Along the way, they pass between the
   Barrier, and Richard is drawn to one of the black towers, and is
   compelled to collect some of the black sand he finds. Later, he is
   instructed to execute a captive woman as tribute to pass through tribal
   land, but refuses and chooses to free the woman instead, who promises
   to take them through the Baku Ban Mana lands. Despite a promise of safe
   passage, she forces Richard into a battle with thirty Baka Ban Mana
   blademasters as their oath dictates. Richard slaughters them by tapping
   in the Sword of Truth's collective knowledge of blade fighting. Killing
   them all, he is bound to marry the priestess, and Richard gives her his
   magic whistle of the Bird Man to attack the neighboring tribes' crops
   and force a peace between them.

   Arriving at the Palace of the Prophets, Richard threatens to kill
   anyone who prevents him from leaving, stating he is a prisoner, not a
   guest or a student. However, Richard is treated lavishly, and given
   absurd amounts of gold, which are symbols of his status as a novice
   wizard, designed to make him not see value in personal wealth. Rather,
   he uses the money to bribe the entire staff of the Palace to his
   service, even hiring a brothel on retainer to service the guards. He
   discovers he is a war wizard: one who has the gift of both additive and
   subtractive magic. Later, he learns from Nathan Rahl, another wizard in
   the Palace of the Prophets and Richard's ancient ancestor, that he is
   the first to be born with such power in three thousand years. It is
   revealed that the Prelate brought Richard to the Palace to flush out
   the Sisters of the Dark, a secret society within the Sisters of the
   Light dedicated to the task of unleashing the Keeper into the world of
   the living.

   Kahlan embarks on a long trek back to her home of Aydindril along with
   three mud people. Along the way, they come across a sacked city,
   Ebinissia, with the inhabitants' corpses filling the streets and the
   surrounding countryside. Kahlan and the three mud people race to catch
   up with a band of some five thousand troops that are trailing the enemy
   which sacked Ebinissia. She is shocked to realize that these soldiers
   are all teenagers and entirely undertrained and unprepared to attack
   the seasoned, well organized and vastly superior enemy forces. She
   assumes command of the army and organizes a series of guerilla attacks
   on what she now knows to be The Imperial Order. Victorious, Kahlan
   returns to Ayndindril, where she stumbles across Zedd and the sorceress
   Adie, both of whom had their memories deleted earlier. She returns his
   memory by telling him that Richard is with the Sisters of the Light.
   Enraged, Zedd tells Kahlan he will have her beheaded for what she has
   done, and that she has condemned Richard to a thousand years of his
   literal nightmares.

   After months at the Palace, Richard escapes after killing several
   Sisters of the Dark. Knowing he must save the world first, he travels
   to D'hara. At the Peoples Palace, Richard destroys a spell from a
   Sister of the Dark by using the black sorcerer's sand to corrupt the
   spell. He then avoids making a last moment mistake by placing the Stone
   of Tears on Darken Rahl. Richard returns the Stone of Tears to the
   underworld and once again defeats the Keeper, he rushes to Aydindril to
   find Kahlan. Upon finding Kahlan has already been executed, Richard
   kills all the councillors who sentenced her to death. Finding Kahlan's
   grave, he realizes that Zedd has cast a death spell to make all believe
   that Kahlan is dead. Denna's spirit visited the both of them and they
   were reunited in a place between worlds.
