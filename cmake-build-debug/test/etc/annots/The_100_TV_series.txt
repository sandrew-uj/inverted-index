   Ninety-seven years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out
   almost all life on Earth, thousands of people now live in a space
   station orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark. Three generations have
   been born in space, but when life-support systems on the Ark begin to
   fail, one hundred juvenile detainees are sent to Earth in a last
   attempt to determine whether it is habitable, or at least save
   resources for the remaining residents of the Ark. They discover that
   some survived the apocalypse: the Grounders, who live in clans locked
   in a power struggle; the Reapers, another group of grounders who have
   been turned into cannibals by the Mountain Men; and the Mountain Men,
   who live in Mount Weather, descended from those who locked themselves
   away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership of Bellamy and Clarke,
   the juveniles attempt to survive the harsh surface conditions, battle
   hostile grounders and establish communication with the Ark.

   In the second season, forty-eight of the remaining detainees are
   captured and taken to Mount Weather by the Mountain Men. The Mountain
   Men are transfusing blood from imprisoned grounders as an
   anti-radiation treatment as their bodies have not adapted to deal with
   the remaining radiation on Earth. Medical tests of the forty-eight show
   their bone marrow will allow the Mountain Men to survive outside
   containment, so the Mountain Men begin taking the youths' bone marrow.
   Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Ark have crash-landed various
   stations on Earth and begin an alliance with the grounders to save both
   their people, naming the main settlement at Alpha Station "Camp Jaha".
   The season ends with the massacre of the Mountain Men to save the
   prisoners. During this time, former Chancellor Jaha leads a group in
   search of a fabled "City of Light." Jaha discovers an artificial
   intelligence named A.L.I.E. while John Murphy finds an alarming video
   implying a connection between the AI and the destruction of the world.

   In the third season, Alpha Station renamed Arkadia, comes under new
   management when Pike, a former teacher, and mentor on the Ark, is
   elected as chancellor and begins a war with the grounders. Pike kills
   an encampment of grounder warriors while they sleep, which further
   damages their already fragile relationship with the grounders.
   Furthermore, the grounder leader Lexa is killed by her mentor during a
   failed assassination attempt on Clarke. A.L.I.E. - who was commanded to
   make life better for mankind - is revealed to have responded by solving
   the problem of human overpopulation by launching the nuclear apocalypse
   that devastated Earth, and begins to use ingestible computer chips to
   take control of peoples' minds. A.L.I.E. is ultimately destroyed by
   Clarke, but not before warning of another impending apocalyptic
   disaster.

   In the fourth season, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are
   melting down due to decades of neglect that will result in the majority
   of the planet becoming uninhabitable. Clarke and the others search for
   ways to survive the coming wave of radiation. When it is discovered
   that the grounders with black blood - known as the Nightbloods - can
   metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others attempt to recreate the
   formula, but fail to test it. An old bunker is discovered that can
   protect 1,200 people for over five years from the new apocalypse; each
   of the twelve clans selects a hundred people to stay in the bunker. A
   small group decides to return to space and attempt to survive in the
   remnants of the Ark. Clarke, who is now a nightblood, remains on the
   Earth's surface alone.

   In the fifth season, six years after the meltdown of the nuclear
   reactors, a prisoner transport ship arrives in the only green spot left
   on Earth, where Clarke and Madi, a Nightblood grounder who also
   survived the wave of radiation that swept the planet after the
   meltdown, have been living. Those who survived in space and in the
   bunker have returned safely on the ground. A struggle for the Shallow
   Valley between the prisoners and a new, united clan, known as Wonkru,
   begins, resulting in a battle ending with the valley being destroyed.
   The survivors escape to space and go into cryosleep while they wait for
   the Earth to recover. However, Monty discovers that Earth will
   apparently never recover and, before dying of old age, sets the prison
   ship on a course for a new world.

   In the sixth season, after 125 years in cryosleep, Clarke, Bellamy, and
   the others wake up to find out that they are no longer orbiting Earth
   and have been brought to a new habitable world, Alpha, also known as
   Sanctum. After landing on this world, they discover a new society, led
   by ruling families known as the Primes. They also discover new dangers
   in this new world, and a mysterious rebel group, known as the Children
   of Gabriel as well as a mysterious Anomaly. Clarke falls victim to the
   Primes and ends up in a battle with one for control of her body, a
   fight which she ultimately wins. The season ends with the deaths of
   most of the Primes, but also with the loss of Abby Griffin and Marcus
   Kane. Throughout the season, Madi is haunted through the Flame AI by
   the spirit of the Dark Commander, an evil grounder leader that had
   ruled when Indra was a child. In order to save Madi, Raven is forced to
   destroy the Flame, but the Dark Commander escapes.

   The seventh season finds the inhabitants of Sanctum trying to find a
   way to live together in peace following the aftermath of the events of
   the previous season while battling the resurrected Dark Commander. At
   the same time, Clarke and others come into conflict with the mysterious
   Disciples, humans from another world who are convinced that Clarke
   holds the key to winning the last war that is coming. The season also
   explores the mysterious Anomaly introduced in the sixth season, now
   identified as a wormhole linking six planets, one of them being a
   regenerated Earth, together. After vanishing and being believed dead
   for some time, Bellamy returns but converts to the Disciple cause,
   having gone through a life-changing experience while stuck in the cold
   and treacherous mountains. After returning and converting to the
   Disciple cause, this leads to his death at Clarke's hands. At the end
   of the series, the Dark Commander is permanently killed by Indra and
   humanity achieves Transcendence aside from Clarke who committed murder
   during the test. They find out the test isn't an actual war, but a way
   to the afterlife filled with peace. Clarke returns to Earth where her
   surviving friends and Octavia's new boyfriend Levitt choose to join her
   for a peaceful new life, although Madi remains Transcended.
