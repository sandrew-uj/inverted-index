   The story explores the fate of a magic-ridden far future Earth at the
   end of an age of chaotic miracles between the death of the world's
   latest divinity, the Goddess, and the birth of a new one, chronicling
   the struggle over the nature the next deity will take and thus that of
   the world itself.

   The immense corpse of the Goddess is preserved as a relic beneath the
   sacred city of Ai Hanlo, presided over by its saintly ruler
   Tharanodeth, guardian of the Goddess's bones. Unknown to him, a
   malevolent witch has designs on his city and the holiness it guards.
   Feigning death, she sacrifices her eyes to a demon for power in a
   complex scheme that allows her soul to possess Tharanodeth's infant son
   Kaemen. The soul is delivered by a similcrum child created around the
   eyes, which is then abandoned in the Kaemen's nursery as a foundling.

   The court wizard Hadel, suspecting the foundling a threat, advises
   doing away with him, but Tharanodeth intervenes, protecting him and
   naming him Ginna. Kaemen and Ginna both grow up in the palace, the
   former, under the witch's spell, becoming willful, cruel and selfish,
   while the latter is a blank slate whose passive innocence leads
   Tharanodeth to prefer him to his own son.

   When the boys are twelve, Tharanodeth dies, and Kaemen takes his place
   as ruler. Ginna continues to live a neglected existence in the palace,
   taught by Hadel and befriended by a young girl. After three years the
   boy and girl flee Ai Hanlo and Kaemen's increasingly capricious
   tyranny, which is ushering in an apocalypse of blood and darkness. They
   fall in with a merchant caravan and later a ship manned by mystical
   warriors as the darkness spreading from the city taints and changes the
   world, engulfing humanity and awakening long-buried monsters and
   horrors.

   Ginna gains knowledge and some power during his journey, but despairs
   of making a difference. He reaches the goal of his quest, an
   otherworldly grove of light watched over by the spirit of the Goddess's
   mother, and learns the secret of the horror overtaking the world and
   his own origin and purpose. His destiny brings him into direct conflict
   with the doomed Kaemen and the malign vision of his witch-creator, with
   the outcome of the struggle to decide the fate of the world and the
   nature of the deity that will preside over its next phase. Will it be
   one of death and decay, or is some kind of redemption possible?
