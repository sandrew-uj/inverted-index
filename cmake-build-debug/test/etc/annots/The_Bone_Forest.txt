   The Bone Forest is a collection of fantasy short stories by British
   writer Robert Holdstock, published in 1991 (UK) and 1992 (US). It opens
   with a novella of the same name, followed by seven short stories. The
   novella is a prequel to the entire Mythago Wood cycle. According to the
   author it was written "to fill in the background and back-story to
   Mythago Wood" at the request of a screenwriter who was working on a
   planned movie version of Mythago Wood.^[1]

   The 1991 and 1992 editions of the book contain seven short stories in
   addition to the novella The Bone Forest., after which the volume takes
   its name. The additional stories in The Bone Forest bear little
   relation with either time or events in the Mythago Wood cycle, yet the
   short stories are largely influenced by the fantasy realm created as
   part of the Mythago Wood cycle.^[2]

   The Bone Forest has both won and been nominated for fantasy literature
   awards.
