   Elspeth Gordie and her brother Jes grow up in an orphanage after their
   parents are burned as Seditioners. Elspeth has enhanced mental
   abilities and must conceal them in order to avoid being discovered as a
   Misfit. At the beginning of the first book in the series, Obernewtyn,
   Elspeth is named a Misfit and is sent to Obernewtyn, a place run by
   people who claim to investigate the Misfits and look for a cure to
   their abilities.

   At Obernewtyn, Elspeth discovers what is really happening to all the
   Misfits that Madam Vega, the co-owner of Obernewtyn, claims she is
   curing. Together the Misfits form an uprising and take over Obernewtyn,
   turning it into a secret refuge for both Misfits and animals.

   Elspeth is not just a Misfit; she is what the animals call the Innle,
   or Seeker in English, and she must find and destroy the weaponmachines
   around the world. The weaponmachines are what caused the Great White,
   and Elspeth has to seek them out to destroy them before the world is
   plunged into another Great White.

   However, the Misfits can't hide forever and must find a place in The
   Land as it enters a period of turmoil, as rebels begin to revolt
   against the Council and the Herder Faction. The elusive Twentyfamilies'
   Gypsies, and half-blooded gypsies, also play an important role in the
   political and social struggles of The Land.
