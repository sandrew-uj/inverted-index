   The main character, Abelard Lindsay, is born in the ancient lunar
   colony Mare Serenitatis Circumlunar Corporate Republic, into a family
   of aristocratic Mechanists, but after being sent to the Shaper's Ring
   Council, he receives specialized and experimental diplomatic training
   and gives his loyalty to the Shapers' cause. He, his best friend and
   fellow Shaper protege Philip Constantine and the beautiful and
   passionate Preservationist Vera Kelland lead an insurgency against the
   rulers of the republic, who use Mechanist technology to prolong their
   lives. The three of them influence the younger generation towards the
   Shapers' cause in their pursuit of Preservationism, a movement devoted
   to the preservation of Earth-bound human culture. Kelland and Lindsay
   agree to kill themselves as a political statement, but Lindsay reneges
   on his suicide pact after Kelland is dead. Constantine attempts to kill
   Lindsay but instead kills a Mechanist, creating a scandal.

   Constantine is allowed to remain in the Republic because his knowledge
   is needed to keep the Republic's environment from self-destructing but
   Lindsay is exiled to the Mare Tranquilitatis Circumlunar People's
   Zaibatsu. This lunar colony, which collapsed due to an environmental
   crisis, has become a refuge for "sundogs", criminals, dissidents and
   wanderers. There he meets Kitsune, a woman modified by the Shapers to
   be an ideal prostitute. Apparently a servant of the Geisha Bank, a
   powerful money center, she in fact rules the bank through the remotely
   operated body of her now brain-dead predecessor. In his months on the
   Zaibatsu, Lindsay uses his diplomatic talents to organize a complex
   fraud involving a fictitious theatrical event and befriends an old
   Mechanist, Fyodor Ryumin. However, eventually the fraud takes on a life
   of its own, and the new-formed Kabuki Intrasolar becomes a legitimate
   artistic and business venture. Lindsay cannot remain to enjoy the
   profits, though: Constantine has in the meantime overthrown the
   Corporate Republic's government. Constantine has abandoned
   Preservationism to become a Shaper militant, and sends an assassin to
   present a stark choice: become Constantine's pawn or be killed by the
   assassin. Lindsay manages to escape with a group of Mechanist pirates,
   in the process aiding Kitsune to take power of the Geisha Bank openly.

   Lindsay joins a ship called the Red Consensus, which doubles as the
   nation-state of the Fortuna Miners' Democracy, after the failure of the
   previously independent asteroid mining Mechanist cartel. The FMD,
   financed by more wealthy Mechanists cartels, annexes the asteroid
   Esairs XII, home to the Mavrides family, a small shaper clan. Lindsay
   meets Nora Mavrides, a fellow diplomat. Nora informs Abelard that the
   subjects of the diplomatic training are in disgrace due to the high
   incidence of treason and defection from their ranks. The two of them
   work to promote peaceful coexistence between the Shaper militants and
   the Mechanist pirates, but after several months of conflict, espionage,
   murders and sabotages, open fighting breaks out. Mavrides and Lindsay,
   now lovers, eventually murder their companions to save one another.
   Before the asteroid's life-support systems shut down after the battle,
   the alien Investors arrive.

   Peace finally comes to the Schismatrix after the aliens arrive. The
   alien Investors are obsessed with trade and wealth, and at first
   encourage humanity to focus on business instead of war. Trade
   flourishes and the Shapers and Mechanists put their differences aside.
   Lindsay and Mavrides become powerful Shaper leaders, thanks to their
   early contact with the Investors. The Investor Peace does not last
   forever, though, and tensions between Shapers and Mechanists eventually
   start to rise when the Investors play the factions against one another.
   Ultimately Philip Constantine rises to power and takes control of the
   Ring Council, ousting Mavride's and Lindsay's pro-detente faction.
   Lindsay runs away from what he sees as a hopeless battle, but Nora
   decides to stay in the Rings, where they had built their lives and
   family, to fight Constantine and his militant government.

   Lindsay escapes to the Mechanist cartels in the asteroid belt, where
   Kitsune has again secretly taken power. There Lindsay works ceaselessly
   for decades to bring about the detente he believes will reunite him
   with Mavrides. Using a recording of an Investor's ship queen involved
   in some taboo activities to blackmail the alien, Lindsay contributes to
   the creation of Czarina-Kluster, neither Shaper nor Mechanist, which
   quickly becomes one of the richest and most powerful states in the
   solar system. Lindsay's partner, Wellspring, plans to use the colony to
   promote his post-humanist ideology, while Lindsay himself seeks to
   bring Nora to the new colony. However, Constantine discovers Mavride's
   plan to defect and forces her to kill herself. Consumed with hatred,
   Lindsay for the first time confronts his former friend directly,
   arranging a duel with him using an ancient alien artifact called the
   Arena. While Lindsay wins, the Arena leaves both him and Constantine
   catatonic.

   Years after the duel, Lindsay wakes up on his old home, now renamed the
   Neotenic Cultural Republic. Constantine's militant Shaperism has been
   replaced by a Preservationist government, dedicated to remaining a
   cultural preserve where normal, unmodified human life is preserved. As
   part of the treatment that restored Lindsay's mind, his original Shaper
   diplomatic training has been removed. Having returned to a
   Preservationist world, and now restored to a fully human state, Lindsay
   decides to break with his past and embrace new dreams. He becomes a
   post-humanist and returns to Czarina-Kluster to work with Wellspring's
   'Lifesiders' clique.

   In the years during Lindsays' catatonia, the expansion of settlements
   throughout the Solar System has seen an economy in huge surplus; with
   abundant wealth, expensive and prolonged terraforming efforts are first
   being considered. While Wellspring seeks to terraform Mars, Lindsay
   attempts to create an abyssal ecology on Europa. Constantine's Shaper
   family has been disgraced by Constantine's defeat, and Lindsay manages
   to convert them to his cause, even Constantine's "daughter" Vera
   (created from DNA taken from Vera Kelland decades before). As time goes
   on, eventually Czarina-Kluster, in its turn, faces social collapse.
   With his Lifesiders faction's research still in its infancy, Lindsay
   and Vera Constantine secretly break the Interdict and bring back
   samples of Earth's abyssal life, providing the breakthroughs that make
   the Europa project a success.

   As the Lifesiders transform themselves into fish-like forms capable of
   survival in Europa's oceans, Lindsay visits the now-cured Philip
   Constantine. Constantine believes that Lindsay will never see Europa,
   that he will leave in the end rather than see his cause through to
   fruition, just as he always had. He also reveals that Vera
   Constantine's DNA comes as much from Lindsay as Vera Kelland. Philip
   reconciles with Abelard, then commits suicide.

   When Lindsay returns to Europa, he finds that Philip is right: he
   cannot bring himself to undergo the transformation. At that moment, an
   alien Presence, who had followed Vera Constantine since her mission in
   an alien embassy, reveals itself. The being explains that it has been
   devoted to exploring and exulting in the variety of experiences of the
   universe, and invites Lindsay to join it. Lindsay accepts and is
   transformed into a bodiless form, to explore the infinite mysteries of
   the universe for eternity.
