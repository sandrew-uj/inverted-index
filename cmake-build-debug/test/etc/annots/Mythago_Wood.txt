   The events of Mythago Wood occur between 1946 and 1948. Stephen Huxley
   returns from service (after recuperating from his war wounds) to see
   his elder brother Christian, who now lives alone in their childhood
   home, Oak Lodge, just on the edge of Ryhope Wood. Their father, George,
   has died recently (their mother, Jennifer, died some years earlier).
   Christian is disturbed but intrigued by his encounters with one of the
   mythagos, while Stephen is confused and disbelieving when Christian
   explains the enigma of the wood. Both had seen mythagos as children,
   but their father explained them away as travelling Gypsies. Christian
   returns to the wood for longer and longer periods, eventually assuming
   a mythical role himself. In the meantime Stephen reads about his
   father's and Edward Wynne-Jones's studies of the wood. Part of his
   research on the wood causes him to contact Wynne-Jones's daughter, Anne
   Hayden. Stephen also meets a local man named Harry Keeton, a
   burn-scarred ex-RAF pilot, who encountered a similar wood when he was
   shot down over France and has since been trying to find a city that he
   saw there. Stephen and Harry try to survey and photograph Ryhope Wood
   from the air, but their small plane is buffeted back by inexplicable
   winds each time they try to fly over the trees. Stephen soon has his
   own encounters with the woodland mythagos (and an older Christian) and
   eventually, to save both his brother and a mythago girl named
   Guiwenneth (also referred to as Gwyneth or Gwyn), he ventures deep into
   the wood, accompanied by Harry.^[5]^[6]
