   After being devastated by a nuclear war, the Earth is a planet with a
   population of only 4 million, overrun by a variety of mutated
   lifeforms. Worse, much of the Earth is now owned by the Vegans, a race
   of blue-skinned aliens who see the planet as a tourist location. Conrad
   Nomikos, the first person narrator, is a man with a past that he would
   rather not talk about who has been given a task that he would rather
   refuse: to show an influential Vegan around the old ruins of Earth. But
   Conrad suddenly finds himself the reluctant protector of this alien
   visitor when attempts are made on the Vegan's life. Conrad knows that
   keeping the Vegan alive is important--but now he must find out why.

   Conrad now finds himself pitted against a group of Earth rebels that
   includes an old comrade-in-arms and an old lover, neither of whom can
   understand why he would want to protect one of Earth's subjugators. He
   is aided by another old friend and an old man who is actually one of
   his sons. It is eventually revealed that the Vegan he is escorting has
   been charged with the final disposition of the planet Earth. The Vegan
   in his turn is confounded by Conrad's actions. Ostensibly there as a
   tourist to see Earth's sights, he is horrified to find that Conrad is
   having the pyramids of Egypt torn down, more so when the immortal
   explains that the process is being filmed, and that the film will be
   run backwards to simulate the construction of the pyramids. Along the
   way it appears that Conrad's beloved wife is killed in a natural
   cataclysm.

   At the end, the rebels realize that Conrad has been fighting to protect
   the Earth in his own way. Through actions such as the deconstruction of
   the pyramids, Conrad makes the Vegans see that Earthlings would rather
   destroy the planet's riches than see them fall into the hands of
   others. In the final battle to protect the Vegan, Conrad's wife appears
   to deliver the decisive saving blow. The Vegan sees the mettle of which
   Conrad is made, and decides to leave the planet in the possession of
   the one being with the longevity, power and moral fiber to do well by
   it. Conrad finds himself the owner of Earth.
