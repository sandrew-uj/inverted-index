   An international consortium of scientists, operating as Project Inner
   Space in Tanganyika, Africa, is trying to tap into the Earth's
   geothermal energy by drilling a very deep hole down to the Earth's
   core. The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of
   material. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they
   intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole.

   The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is
   secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its
   way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted
   Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust
   have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that
   the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the
   very existence of Earth.

   The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the
   crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly
   along a fault line, causing earthquakes and tidal waves along its path.
   Rampion warns a committee of world leaders that the crack is capable of
   extending beyond the fault, and that should it encircle the Earth,
   causing the land masses to split, the oceans would be sucked in,
   generating steam at high enough of a pressure to rip the Earth apart.

   Sorenson meanwhile discovers that there was a huge reservoir of
   hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic
   explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more
   powerful. Another atomic device, lowered into the magma chamber of an
   island volcano in the path of the crack, is used in the hope of
   stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction.
   Eventually the crack approaches its starting point at the test site,
   and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be
   thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control
   center to record the event, despite pleas by his wife Maggie to
   evacuate with the rest of the project staff. She and Rampion barely
   escape the test site in time to observe the fiery birth of a second
   moon. Its release stops the crack, and the Earth survives.
