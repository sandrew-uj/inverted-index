   The books mainly concern the doings of the "Horseclans", a nomadic
   people originating from the "Sea of Grass"--the Great Plains from
   present-day southern Canada to central Texas, and from the Mississippi
   River to the Rocky Mountains. The Horseclansmen were portrayed as
   fierce, noble and often gifted with telepathy, which came in handy for
   their dealings with their horses and "cats"--sabertoothed tigers that
   had been revived by scientific means in the years before the nuclear
   war.

   Some people, including the Horseclans' founder and mentor-figure, Milo
   Morai, were "Undying"--effectively immortal or at least unaging and
   almost impossible to kill by means other than suffocation, drowning and
   decapitation. The Undying were also sterile, which was a source of
   anguish for some of them.

   The known Undying were:
     * Milo (who did not know his own age due to amnesia caused by a head
       wound in 1936),
     * Bookermann (once a German cavalry officer),
     * Mara (an Ehleen noblewoman who marries Milo),
     * Aldora (an orphaned Ehleen girl taken in by one of the Horseclans),
     * Demetrios (the Ehleen High Lord and the only Undying to perish
       during the course of the books),
     * Drehkos (Nobleman of Morguhn involved in the Great Rebellion),
     * Tim and Giliahna (the children of a Horseclans chief) and
     * Neeka (an Ehleen physician who later also marries Milo).

   In addition, Bookerman mentions two other Undying, one of whom he
   claims is dead.

   Although not among the Undying, two other major characters are
   extremely long-lived, Hari Krooguh being almost two hundred years old
   when last mentioned in the books and Bili Morguhn, aka Bili the Axe,
   remaining active until his death from bear-inflicted injuries at the
   age of almost a century. In addition, both Hari and Bili possess
   extraordinarily strong mental powers of telekinesis and illusion (as
   does Aldora).

   The Horseclans looked down on "dirtmen", or farmers, and by extension
   all non-nomads, although they later resettled on the east coast. Many
   "Dirtman" communities were descended from odd, out-of-the-mainstream
   groups of Americans, and often had religious beliefs that were
   unpleasant at best.

   The main civilization in North America during most of the books is that
   of the "Ehleens"--a conglomeration of Greek-speaking Mediterranean
   peoples who had invaded the eastern half of North America and set up
   kingdoms. The main Ehleen kingdom, Kenooryos Ehlas (New Greece), was
   dominated by a thoroughly corrupt, debased version of the Greek
   Orthodox Church, and the conduct of whose rulers was, in some ways,
   also reminiscent of Hellenistic kings.

   Other peoples the Horseclans dealt with were "Ganiks", "Mehrikans", and
   "Ahrmenee". The "Ganiks" were degraded descendants of hippie communes,
   whose religion of "Orghanikonservashun" (organic-conservation) forbade
   them to eat animal meat (but not human meat; Ganiks were enthusiastic
   cannibals), bathe, or hot-work metal (due to the pollution caused by
   burning coal).

   "Mehrikans" were descendants of present-day Americans. "Ahrmenee" were
   descendants of present-day Armenians living in the Appalachian
   Mountains.

   In a similar fashion to the world of Robert E Howard's Conan and of
   Jack London novels, civilization is seen as having a softening and
   corrupting influence in comparison to the hardy Ahrmenee and the
   Horseclans, although not to the extent that they outweigh the peace and
   prosperity that Milo and others work towards.
