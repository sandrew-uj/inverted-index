   A vampire named Louis de Pointe du Lac tells his 200-year-long life
   story to a reporter referred to simply as "the boy". In 1791, Louis is
   a young indigo plantation owner living in Louisiana. Distraught by the
   death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis
   is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires
   Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become
   immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off slaves while Louis,
   who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from
   animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin
   to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising.
   Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat kill the slaves to
   keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually,
   Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He
   slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes
   increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of
   compassion for the humans he preys upon.

   Escaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden, five-year-old
   girl, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to
   think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat
   then turns the girl into a vampire "daughter" for them, to give Louis a
   reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially
   horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon
   begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she
   begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures
   into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that
   of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60
   years of living with him, hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning
   him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump his body into a
   nearby swamp. As Louis and Claudia prepare to flee to Europe, Lestat
   appears, having recovered from Claudia's attack, and attacks them in
   turn. Louis sets fire to their home and barely escapes with Claudia,
   leaving a furious Lestat to be consumed by the flames.

   Arriving in Europe, Louis and Claudia seek out more of their kind. They
   travel throughout eastern Europe first and do indeed encounter
   vampires, but these vampires appear to be nothing more than mindless
   animated corpses. It is only when they reach Paris that they encounter
   vampires like themselves - specifically, the 400-year-old vampire
   Armand and his coven at the Theatre des Vampires. Inhabiting an ancient
   theater, Armand and his vampire coven disguise themselves as humans and
   feed on live, terrified humans in mock-plays before a live human
   audience (who think the killings are merely a very realistic
   performance). Claudia is repulsed by these vampires and what she
   considers to be their cheap theatrics, but Louis and Armand are drawn
   to each other.

   Convinced that Louis will leave her for Armand, Claudia convinces Louis
   to turn a Parisian doll maker, Madeleine, into a vampire to serve as a
   replacement companion. Louis, Madeleine and Claudia live together for a
   brief time, but all three are abducted one night by Armand's coven.
   Lestat arrives, having survived the fire in New Orleans. His
   accusations against Louis and Claudia result in Louis being locked in a
   coffin to starve, while Claudia and Madeleine are locked in an open
   courtyard. Armand arrives and releases Louis from the coffin, but
   Madeleine and Claudia are burned to death by the rising sun; a
   devastated Louis finds their ashen remains. Louis returns to the
   Theatre late the following night, burning it to the ground and killing
   all the vampires inside, leaving with Armand. Together, the two travel
   across Europe for several years, but Louis never fully recovers from
   Claudia's death, and the emotional connection between himself and
   Armand quickly dissolves. Tired of the Old World, Louis returns to New
   Orleans in the early 20th century. Living as a loner, he feeds off any
   humans who cross his path, but lives in the shadows, never creating
   another companion for himself.

   Telling the boy of one last encounter with Lestat in New Orleans in the
   1920s, Louis ends his tale; after 200 years, he is weary of immortality
   and of all the pain and suffering to which he has had to bear witness.
   The boy, however, seeing only the great powers granted to a vampire,
   begs to be made into a vampire himself. Angry that his interviewer
   learned nothing from his story, Louis refuses, attacking the boy and
   vanishing without a trace. The boy then leaves to track down Lestat in
   the hopes that he can give him immortality.
