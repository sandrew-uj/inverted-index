   The opening cinematic takes place in a gritty, war-torn future
   depicting a final battle between the world's greatest heroes and
   villains. A future version of Lex Luthor provides voice-over narration.
   This battle takes place in the ruins of Metropolis. Lex Luthor, wearing
   a heavy mech armor, commands an army of super-villains that includes
   Joker, Harley Quinn, Circe, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Giganta, Metallo
   and Poison Ivy. A scarred, armored Batman commands the heroes, which
   includes Cyborg, Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Green Arrow.
   Both Poison Ivy and Green Arrow are shown dead at the beginning of the
   cutscene. The battle culminates with the death of Wonder Woman at
   Luthor's hands, at which point an unshaven, weary Superman hears her
   dying screams from orbit and flies to Earth to confront him. As
   Superman cradles Wonder Woman's dead body, he collapses to the ground
   and it is revealed that Luthor hid Kryptonite pellets in her mouth as a
   trap. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite-tipped spear, and
   stands back to proclaim his victory only to see Brainiac's war fleet
   fill the skies.

   The scene then shifts to the present-day Watchtower, where the future
   Lex Luthor, heavily modified with Brainiac technology, is telling the
   story to the present-day Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Future
   Luthor explains that the deadly final war between the heroes and
   villains was triggered by the subtle manipulations of Brainiac (who had
   been slowly downloading their powers over time). With the planet's most
   powerful beings dead, Brainiac intended to use the pirated data to
   create an army of metahumans under his control, facilitating his
   conquest of Earth. As the sole survivor of the war, Luthor could do
   nothing to resist Brainiac's subjugation of the planet. Luthor explains
   that he was able to survive in secret and eventually steal the stolen
   data and energy from Brainiac's mothership in the form of "exobytes"
   (nanobot-sized devices that can bond to a living host and give them
   their own superpowers). Luthor has traveled into his past to release
   the exobytes into the atmosphere of present-day Earth. The heroes are
   outraged, but Luthor explains that because he has done this, soon
   thousands of new metahumans will be created from ordinary humans
   (becoming the player-characters of the game). He implores the Justice
   League to find and train these new metahumans, because Brainiac is
   coming and the Earth must be ready to succeed where it was once doomed
   to fail.

   When this cinematic ends, the player is brought to the character
   creation menu to build their new Hero or Villain.

   In the second trailer to the game "In Lex we Trust", it is revealed
   that Lex Luthor's description of events leading up to his arrival in
   the present time is not as he described to the heroes. The trailer
   begins with Luthor reviving his companion Fracture from being
   unconscious. Luthor explains that Brainiac's forces have already
   penetrated the Fortress of Solitude and that their time is running out.
   As they approach a time portal chamber, a Brainiac Eradicator attacks
   and Fracture destroys the robotic drone with a small grenade. The two
   arrive at the portal which is being stabilized by Batman (whose face is
   disfigured and arm is replaced by a robotic prosthetic due to injuries
   from the battle of villains and heroes). As more Eradicators enter the
   chamber, Luthor lies saying his armor is damaged and that he can not
   hold them off. Batman tells Fracture to take the canister that contains
   millions of exobytes and go through the portal, while attacking the
   Eradicators in order to buy him more time. Fracture thanks Luthor for
   using the exobytes to give him his powers. Seeing the opportunity he
   had been waiting for, Luthor kills Fracture describing him as "an
   excellent lab rat." Before Luthor steps into the portal, Batman calls
   to Luthor warning that "I'll be coming for you" to which Luthor
   responds "No, you won't" and activates a self-destruct sequence. Luthor
   enters the portal and the Fortress of Solitude suffers massive
   explosions. He arrives in a dark alley, presumably present day. He is
   greeted by his present-day self who describes him as being late.

   At the end of "The Prime Battleground" raid, Future Lex Luthor and Lex
   Luthor worked together to steal Brainiac's power. Luthor is then
   betrayed by Future Luthor, wanting the power for himself. It is then
   revealed Future Batman survived the explosion at the Fortress of
   Solitude and chased Future Luthor through time. Future Luthor escapes
   and Future Batman follows him. In the following cutscene, Future Batman
   is said to be the last hope for humanity.

   Following these events, the heroes led by Future Batman and villains
   led by Future Luthor to the "Nexus of Reality" (the center of the
   Multiverse itself) both fight for control, using paradoxes from
   constant time-travels to alter the histories of iconic characters,
   forcing heroes and villains to work parallel to each other, changing
   the timelines in the same fashion. What one causes, the other reverts,
   thus making an infinite cycle. This results in a massive paradox
   creature that consumes time itself. In the raid, players must stop the
   creature from destroying the time-space continuum (one of the many
   raids where both villains and heroes have the same goal). This event
   partially ends the storyline the game was based upon, yet opens the
   possibility to enter many new realities.

   Since then, there have been certain stories tied in reflecting the
   Arrowverse, with the introduction of Nanda Parbat, fighting alongside
   characters featured in Legends of Tomorrow, and a Supergirl Costume
   Legends character. Content from the DC Extended Universe has also
   been released. Other comic centered storylines feature "Sons of
   Trigon", "Blackest Night", "Amazon Fury", "Halls of Power", "Bombshells
   Paradox", "Bottle City of Kandor", "Harley Quinn", "Earth 3", "Teen
   Titans: The Judas Contract", "Justice League Dark", "Dark Nights:
   Metal" and Birds of Prey in Episodes.
