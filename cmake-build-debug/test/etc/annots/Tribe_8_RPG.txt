   In the near future, creatures from beyond the River of Dream have
   invaded the world and the players - exiles from their tribes - find
   themselves caught in between the warring factions as they try to form a
   fabled eighth tribe.

   Tribe 8 takes place in a land known as Vimary, which is a
   post-apocalyptic Montreal, Quebec, Canada. At some indeterminate point
   in history, something has gone horribly, cosmically wrong. Though the
   nature of this disaster is never fully explained, the result was the
   appearance of the "Z'bri", twisted demonic creatures of spirit who
   either initiated the fall of the "World Before," or came in the wake of
   its destruction. The Z'bri, needing flesh to sate their demonic
   hungers, herded the majority of humanity into camps where they were
   killed or enslaved until the "Fatimas" (Avatars of what is called "The
   One Goddess") imbued humanity with hope and with Synthesis, a potent
   but subtle form of dream magic. In this way, the Z'bri were fought back
   into the wilds. The Fatimas then established the tribal lands of
   Vimary, protecting the inhabitants of their own tribes.

   Player characters typically take on the role of the Fallen, outcasts
   from the Tribes who live on the exile island of Hom (present day Ile
   Sainte-Helene). Although many of the Fallen truly are criminal, many
   have also been cast out from the Tribes due to their inability to deal
   with the unjust society that the Fatimas have built. They are heretics,
   warriors, dreamers, and leaders who hope to build something even when
   society has abandoned them.

   The game has a strong metaplot, which tells the tale of the Fallen's
   struggle with the Tribes, the demonic Z'bri who had destroyed the world
   before, and also with themselves. It focuses on themes of spirituality,
   horror, and the cost of hope in a world that has gone terribly wrong.
