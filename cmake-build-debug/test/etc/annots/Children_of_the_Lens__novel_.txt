   Children of the Lens is the sixth and final book in the Lensman series.
   The story takes place twenty years after the close of Second Stage
   Lensmen, and focuses on the five children of Kimball and Clarissa
   Kinnison: a boy and two pairs of fraternal twin girls. As Kimball and
   Clarissa are both Lensmen, their offspring are dubbed the "Children of
   the Lens". They are also the ultimate product of a
   two-billion-year-long Arisian breeding program that has molded them
   into "third-level" minds with such potential power that not even the
   Arisians themselves fully understand their capabilities.

   The story of the children is intertwined with the story of the five
   Second Stage Lensmen: Kimball, Worsel, Nadreck, Tregonsee, and Clarissa
   (who becomes a Second Stage Lensman). Spurred into action by a series
   of seeming untraceable terrorist attacks, and other unexplainable
   events in both the First and Second Galaxy, Kimball asks the other
   Second Stage Lensmen to help him trace down the source of the troubles.
   Each of these Lensmen rushes to his aid and each pursues the task from
   a different angle. The Second Stage Lensmen address the problem in
   their usual style: Kimball is energetic and direct, Nadreck is cautious
   and thorough, Clarissa gets sent to Lyrane II again, and so on. They
   are each assisted, more or less covertly, by one of the children but
   seem unable to get a grip on the problems. One at a time, each of the
   children realizes that they need additional training, and travel to
   Arisia to obtain it. They are then able to help their Lensman complete
   their missions. All of the lensmen are led to essentially the same
   conclusion: the hitherto unknown planet of Ploor is the location of the
   race controlling the remnants of Boskone.

   As with the other books in the series, the technology in this book far
   surpasses the technology of the previous books. Whereas in earlier
   books free planets were set astride target planets and used like giant
   nut-crackers or negative energy "negaspheres" were the ultimate in
   weaponry, unique items constructed with great difficulty, in Children
   of the Lens these weapons are deployed in the hundreds by both sides.
   The Eddorians develop their own version of the Lens, permitting the
   creation of "Black Lensmen" who, because of the basic flaws in the way
   the Eddorians deal with their subject races, turn out to be
   surprisingly ineffective. The hyperspace tubes, rare in earlier books,
   are now the standard way to insert an invading fleet into enemy
   territory. Not only are the massive fleets of Civilization equipped
   with single-shot "primary" and "secondary" beam weapons, they now have
   super-atomic (total conversion of mass to energy) bombs, also deployed
   by the thousands. The Patrol eventually revisits the strange alternate
   universe called "Nth space", where nothing goes slower than light.
   There they render two superluminal planets inertialess to use as the
   ultimate weapons in destroying both Ploor and its sun. Soon two Patrol
   hyperspace tubes open, one aimed at Ploor and another one aimed at its
   sun. The Ploorians are confident that their world's defences are
   powerful enough to handle anything the Patrol can throw at them. The
   two planets, traveling faster than light, erupt from the ends of the
   tubes and strike the planet and its sun. The Ploorian solar system
   simply ceased to exist.

   After the destruction of Ploor, Mentor of Arisia alerts the children to
   the Eddorian threat, pointing out that unless they are dealt with
   quickly, they too will figure out the secret of obtaining superluminal
   planet busters and destroy Arisia, Earth, and Klovia in short order.
   The Eddorians must be destroyed immediately.

   Mentor sends out a call to every living Lensman and using the combined
   mental energy of all the Lensmen in two galaxies, the entire Arisian
   race, and the Children of the Lens they prepare to launch a mental bolt
   against the Eddorians. The children have learned to form a five-fold
   super-mind called "The Unit". This was what the long Arisian breeding
   program was trying to achieve. The Unit is so advanced that even the
   Arisians don't know what it is capable of doing.

   The mental bolt, with the massed power of every Lensman, every Arisian,
   and the Children of the Lens behind it, and guided by the Unit strikes,
   and penetrates, Eddore's defenses. With the failure of those defenses,
   the ancient enemies of Civilization are defeated and cease to exist.
   The long struggle against the Eddorians is finally over. At this point,
   Mentor reveals that the Arisians are passing on to the next plane of
   existence, their job as the guardians of Civilization finished. They
   have succeeded in developing a race far better than they to protect the
   galaxies, the Kinnison children. With this statement, the voice of
   Mentor, the last Arisian, fades and they are gone.

   In an epilogue, Kit Kinnison leaves a message in a time capsule for a
   future civilization, presumably under threat from a new enemy, but so
   far in the future that the events of the long struggle between
   Civilization and Boskone may have been forgotten. This message tells
   the story of the war against Boskone and tells how to contact the
   Children of the Lens.
