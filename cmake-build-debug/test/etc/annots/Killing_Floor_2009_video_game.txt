   A genetically manipulated and cloned human being as they appear in the
   game, showing grotesque mutations.

   The game takes place in London, England. Horzine Biotech, a
   biotechnology company, is contracted to conduct experiments of a
   military nature involving mass cloning and genetic manipulation.
   Something goes horribly wrong during the process of the
   experimentation, and human subjects begin to exhibit grotesque
   mutations and disfigurement. They become increasingly hostile, and
   eventually overrun the internal security forces of the corporation.

   Hours later, the first waves of the specimens break out onto the
   surface, disrupting a peace protest outside the well-known military
   contractor. Despite the best efforts of the local police, the civilians
   are quickly overwhelmed and consumed by the seemingly endless supply of
   clones now streaming from the gaping maw of Horzine Biotech's
   headquarters. Having escaped their sterile prison, the creatures begin
   to fan out to neighboring areas, devouring the helpless citizens of
   London while the Metropolitan Police fruitlessly attempt to fight back.

   Desperate to contain the outbreak from reaching overseas as planned by
   the mutated and cybernetically-enhanced scientist Dr. Kevin "The
   Patriarch" Clamely, the British government quickly begins to organize
   ragtag teams of surviving British Army soldiers and Special Branch
   police officers to fight back against the hordes of mutated
   "specimens." The player takes the role of a member of one of these
   teams as they partake in a variety of missions in and around the city
   of London.
