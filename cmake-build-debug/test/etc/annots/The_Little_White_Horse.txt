   Maria Merryweather becomes an orphan at age 13 on her father's death in
   1842. She is sent to Moonacre Manor in the West side, accompanied by
   her governess Miss Heliotrope and dog Wiggins. There she finds herself
   in a world out of time. Her cousin and guardian Sir Benjamin
   Merryweather is one of the "sun" Merryweathers, and she loves him right
   away, as "sun" and "moon" Merryweathers do. Maria discovers that there
   is an ancient mystery about the founding of the estate.

   She is aided by wonderful people and magical beasts, but it is by
   self-sacrifice and perseverance, too, that Maria is able to save
   Moonacre, right the wrongs, reunite lost loves and finally bring peace
   to the valley.
