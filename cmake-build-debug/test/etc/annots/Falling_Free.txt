   The novel is set about 200 years before the birth of Miles Vorkosigan,
   the protagonist of much of the Vorkosigan series. It deals with the
   creation of the "Quaddies", genetically modified people who have four
   arms, the second pair appearing where unmodified humans would have
   legs. They were intended to be used as a space labor force, superbly
   adapted to zero-gravity but more or less helpless "downside" in any but
   the lightest gravitational field. From the point of view of the
   commercial interests responsible for their creation, they would be
   highly profitable laborers, requiring none of the special facilities or
   mandatory time off needed by other humans, whose bodies tend to
   deteriorate over the long term in weightlessness. They would also be
   completely beholden to the company for life support and would have no
   rights as human beings.

   Legally, the Quaddies are not classed as human but as "post-fetal
   experimental tissue cultures". The company treats them as chattel
   slaves. Their access to information is tightly controlled; even their
   children's stories are about working in space. They can be ordered to
   reproduce or to have a pregnancy terminated. They are the subject of
   breeding programs, the company compelling them to mate only with one of
   the company's choosing, regardless of existing partners. When a new
   artificial gravity technology renders them both obsolete and a
   potential political embarrassment to the executives, there are
   discussions about killing or sterilizing them. Bipedal engineer Leo
   Graf, who had been assigned to help train them, instead helps them
   break free. They eventually settle in an initially remote system that
   gradually becomes a major part of the Nexus.

   Bujold has stated in the notes of her reprints that Falling Free was
   the first half of the intended story. The unwritten, second story was
   to tell how the Quaddies settled into what would be known as
   "Quaddiespace". Diplomatic Immunity, published in 2002, revisits the
   subject of the Quaddies, showing the state of their society some 240
   years after its foundation. It takes place on Graf Station, named for
   Leo Graf, who is hero and patriarch to the Quaddies.
