   The novel, initially set in Jamaica, opens a short while after the
   Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1
   August 1834. The protagonist Antoinette relates the story of her
   life from childhood to her arranged marriage to an English gentleman,
   Mr. Rochester.

   The novel is in three parts:

   Part One takes place in Coulibri, a sugar plantation in Jamaica, and is
   narrated by Antoinette as a child. Formerly wealthy, since the
   abolition of slavery, the estate has become derelict and her family has
   been plunged into poverty. Antoinette's mother, Annette, must remarry
   to wealthy English gentleman Mr. Mason, who is hoping to exploit his
   new wife's situation. Angry at the returning prosperity of the planter
   class, emancipated slaves living in Coulibri burn down Annette's house,
   killing Antoinette's mentally disabled younger brother, Pierre. As
   Annette had been struggling with her mental health up until this point,
   the grief of losing her son weakens her sanity. Mr. Mason sends her to
   live with a couple who torment her until she dies, and Antoinette does
   not see her again.

   Part Two alternates between the points of view of Antoinette and her
   husband during their honeymoon excursion to Granbois, Dominica. Likely
   catalysts for Antoinette's downfall are the mutual suspicions that
   develop between the couple, and the machinations of Daniel, who claims
   he is Antoinette's illegitimate half-brother; he impugns Antoinette's
   reputation and mental state and demands money to keep quiet.
   Antoinette's old nurse Christophine openly distrusts Mr. Rochester. His
   apparent belief in the stories about Antoinette's family and past
   aggravate the situation; her husband is unfaithful and emotionally
   abusive. He begins to call her Bertha rather than her real name and
   flaunts his affairs in front of her to cause her pain. Antoinette's
   increased sense of paranoia and the bitter disappointment of her
   failing marriage unbalance her already precarious mental and emotional
   state. She flees to the house of Christophine, the servant woman who
   raised her. Antoinette pleads with Christophine for an obeah potion to
   attempt to reignite her husband's love, which Christophine reluctantly
   gives her. Antoinette returns home but the love potion acts like a
   poison on her husband. Subsequently he refuses Christophine's offer of
   help for his wife and takes her to England.

   Part Three is the shortest part of the novel; it is from the
   perspective of Antoinette, renamed by her husband as Bertha. She is
   largely confined to "the attic" of Thornfield Hall, the mansion she
   calls the "Great House". The story traces her relationship with Grace
   Poole, the servant who is tasked with guarding her, as well as her
   disintegrating life with Mr. Rochester, as he hides her from the world.
   He makes empty promises to come to her more but sees less of her. He
   ventures away to pursue relationships with other women--and eventually
   with the young governess. Antoinette is clearly mad and has little
   understanding of how much time she has been confined. She fixates on
   options of freedom including her stepbrother Richard who, however, will
   not interfere with her husband, so she attacks him with a stolen knife.
   Expressing her thoughts in stream of consciousness, Antoinette dreams
   of flames engulfing the house and her freedom from the life she has
   there, and believes it is her destiny to fulfill the vision. Waking
   from her dream she escapes her room, and sets the fire.
