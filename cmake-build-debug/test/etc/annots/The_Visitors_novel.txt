   The story outlines contact between Earth and the title Visitors, a
   group of mysterious objects from deep space. The Visitors are simple
   black oblong boxes, as large as buildings, which approach from space
   and orbit the Earth before descending to the United States. The nature
   of the visitors is kept rather mysterious -- it's not clear if they are
   vehicles or living things in their own right. They are apparently
   unable to communicate with humans in any meaningful way; on one
   occasion a human is taken inside a Visitor, only to be released after
   experiencing a jumble of confusing colored lights and smells which he
   did not understand.

   The Visitors are composed largely of a dense form of cellulose, and
   they proceed to consume a quantity of trees and plant life in the US.
   Eventually, they start producing vehicles, superficially resembling
   human cars but capable of flying using the same unknown principles as
   the Visitors themselves, and apparently incorporating some element of
   intelligence, or at least instinct, since they do not crash into things
   as they move. The humans assume that the Visitors have created these
   vehicles as a gift in return for the plant matter which the Visitors
   are consuming, and the novel touches on the disruption such
   well-meaning gifts might incur on the Earth's economic systems. Toward
   the end of the book, the Visitors also start producing housing units
   for humans, and it is even implied that something living may be inside
   them -- perhaps even a Visitor-produced version of humans themselves.
