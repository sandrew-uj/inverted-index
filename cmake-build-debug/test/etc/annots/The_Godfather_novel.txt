   The Corleone family, one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia,
   fights the other four families in a brutal war in the years after World
   War II. After Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug kingpin
   Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, Corleone's two sons, Santino ("Sonny") and
   Michael, must run the family business with the help of consigliere Tom
   Hagen and the family's two trusted caporegimes, Peter Clemenza and
   Salvatore Tessio. When Michael murders Sollozzo and his bodyguard,
   corrupt NYPD officer Captain Mark McCluskey, while meeting with them in
   a restaurant, the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which
   results in Sonny's murder; Michael is forced to assume control of the
   family as the new Don. Under his retired father's tutelage, Michael
   orchestrates a plan to extract revenge, while relocating the Corleone
   family's power base to Las Vegas in order to further his goal of
   legitimizing the family and getting them out of organized crime. This
   encompasses the murder of all of the Corleone family's enemies,
   including Michael's brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in
   Sonny's murder. After selling all of the family's remaining businesses
   in New York, the Corleones permanently move to Las Vegas.
