   Letters in the archive correspondence of Chaim Weizmann, first
   president of Israel, hint that, in his profession as a distinguished
   organic chemist, Weizmann had stumbled on a method for the cheap
   synthesis of petroleum. Now, decades later, a world buffeted by oil
   shocks and perpetually rising prices would welcome such a chemical
   miracle. But Weizmann's laboratory notebooks must be found first, and
   an unseen and powerful enemy will stop at nothing to keep them hidden.
