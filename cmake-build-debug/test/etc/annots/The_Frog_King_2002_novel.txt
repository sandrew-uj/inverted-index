   Harry Driscoll is an editorial assistant living in New York. He works
   for a major publishing house, but is failing to make an impression by
   not taking his job seriously. He constantly arrives at the office late
   and intoxicated. He is bitter, cynical and troubled but very charming.
   The only thing he (secretly) cares about is his long suffering
   girlfriend - Evie; but he is unable to commit, be faithful or tell her
   he loves her. Soon his self-destructive actions will send his life into
   a rapid descent.
