   Set in an enclave of summer homes for the power elite in the outskirts
   Montreal, the story follows world-weary American Alexandra Brighton as
   she travels with son Samuel to the home of Ruth and Ramey Sandeley. On
   the night of their arrival the mother and child stay in a dilapidated
   Victorian set on an island on Black Lake. Alexandra's night of terror
   there sets her on a quest to learn its secrets. However, she is unaware
   that her provocative hosts have their own agenda. Inside the French
   Canadian underworld the fragile beauty is pampered and groomed in the
   finest salons of Old Montreal, advised by mystics and gypsies, and
   begins a journey of self-discovery. As the secrets of Black Lake are
   revealed Alexandra is lured into a web of deceit and betrayal where her
   own hidden truths emerge, including an obsession with charismatic Ramey
   Sandeley. Her identity crisis is mirrored by the increasing instability
   of Ruth and recklessness of Ramey, and ultimately threatens the safety
   of her child.

   An unspeakable legacy is at stake for the covert clan of Black Lake and
   Alexandra is challenged to confront the forces that have shaped her
   life's path.
