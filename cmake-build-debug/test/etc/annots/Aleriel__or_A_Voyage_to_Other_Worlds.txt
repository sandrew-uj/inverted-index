   Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds is a science fiction novel by
   Wladislaw Somerville Lach-Szyrma, a Polish-English curate, author, and
   historian.

   Published in 1883, Aleriel is a Victorian novel, which was previously
   thought to be the first published work to apply the word Martian as a
   noun (it is now known that the word was first used in 1877^[1]): After
   the protagonist, Aleriel, lands on Mars, he buries his spacecraft in
   snow, "so that it might not be disturbed by any Martian who might come
   across it".^[2]

   A new edition was published in 2015. It includes the same text and a
   new introduction by Richard Dunn (Royal Museums Greenwich) and Marek
   Kukula (Royal Observatory Greenwich).^[3]
