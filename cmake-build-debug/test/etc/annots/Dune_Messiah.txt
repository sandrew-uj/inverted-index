   Twelve years after the events described in Dune (1965), Paul "Muad'Dib"
   Atreides rules as Emperor. By accepting the role of messiah to the
   Fremen, Paul had unleashed a jihad which conquered most of the known
   universe.^[1] Paul is the most powerful emperor ever known, but is
   powerless to stop the lethal excesses of the religious juggernaut he
   has created. Although 61 billion people have perished, Paul's prescient
   visions indicate that this is far from the worst possible outcome for
   humanity. Motivated by this knowledge, Paul hopes to set humanity on a
   course that will not inevitably lead to stagnation and destruction,
   while at the same time acting as ruler of the empire and focal point of
   the Fremen religion.

   The Bene Gesserit, Spacing Guild, and Tleilaxu conspire to dethrone
   Paul, and the Guild Navigator Edric is able to use his own prescience
   to shield the plot from Paul's prescient visions. The Bene Gesserit
   Reverend Mother Mohiam has enlisted Paul's own consort Princess Irulan,
   daughter of the deposed Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Paul has refused
   to father a child with Irulan (or even touch her), but he and his
   Fremen concubine Chani have also failed to produce an heir, causing
   tension within his monarchy. Desperate both to secure her place in the
   Atreides dynasty and to preserve the Atreides bloodline for the Bene
   Gesserit breeding program, Irulan has secretly been giving
   contraceptives to Chani. Paul is aware of this fact, but has foreseen
   that the birth of his heir will bring Chani's death, and does not want
   to lose her. The Tleilaxu Face Dancer Scytale gives Paul a gift he
   cannot resist: a Tleilaxu-grown ghola of the deceased Duncan Idaho,
   Paul's childhood teacher and friend, now called "Hayt". The
   conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul's ability to
   rule by forcing Paul to question himself and the empire he has created.
   Furthermore, Paul's acceptance of the gift weakens his support among
   the Fremen, who see the Tleilaxu and their tools as unclean. Chani,
   taking matters into her own hands, switches to a traditional Fremen
   fertility diet, preventing Irulan from being able to tamper with her
   food, and soon becomes pregnant. It becomes clear her fetuses are
   developing much faster than normal, putting a strain on her body.

   Otheym, one of Paul's former Fedaykin death commandos, reveals evidence
   of a Fremen conspiracy against Paul. Otheym gives Paul his dwarf
   Tleilaxu servant Bijaz, who, like a recording machine, can remember
   faces, names, and details. Paul accepts reluctantly, seeing the strands
   of a Tleilaxu plot. As Paul's soldiers attack the conspirators, others
   set off an atomic weapon called a stone burner, purchased from the
   Tleilaxu, that destroys the area and blinds Paul. By tradition, all
   blind Fremen exile themselves in the desert, but Paul shocks the Fremen
   and entrenches his godhood by proving he can still see, even without
   eyes. His oracular powers have become so developed that he can foresee
   in his mind everything that happens, so by moving through his life in
   lockstep with his visions, he can see even the slightest details of the
   world around him. Bijaz, actually an agent of the Tleilaxu, uses a
   specific humming intonation to implant a command that will compel Hayt
   to attempt to kill Paul under certain circumstances. Chani dies in
   childbirth, and Paul's reaction to her death triggers Hayt, who
   attempts to kill Paul. Hayt's ghola body reacts against its own
   programming and Duncan's full consciousness is recovered,
   simultaneously making him independent of Tleilaxu control.

   Paul and Chani's newborn twins come into the world fully conscious with
   Kwisatz Haderach-like access to ancestral memories. The son is a total
   surprise for Paul, who had only foreseen the birth of their daughter.
   Scytale offers to revive Chani as a ghola, but Paul refuses to submit,
   considering the possibility that the Tleilaxu might program Chani in
   some diabolical way. The Face Dancer then threatens the infants with a
   knife to force Paul to accept, and also demands all of his CHOAM
   holdings in return. By successfully escaping the oracular trap and
   setting the universe on a new path, Paul has been rendered completely
   blind, yet he is able to kill Scytale with an accurately aimed dagger
   due to a psychic vision from his son's perspective. Later that evening
   Bijaz approaches Paul and repeats Scytale's offer, but is killed by
   Duncan on Paul's order. Now prophetically and physically blind, Paul
   chooses to embrace the Fremen tradition of a blind man walking alone
   into the desert, winning the fealty of the Fremen for his children, who
   will inherit his empire. Paul leaves Alia, now romantically involved
   with Duncan, as regent for the twins, whom he has named Leto and
   Ghanima. Alia orders the execution of Edric, Mohiam, and others
   involved in the plot against her brother, going against his wish that
   none of them should be hurt, but spares Irulan. Duncan notes the irony
   that Paul and Chani's deaths have enabled them to triumph against their
   enemies, and that Paul has escaped deification by walking into the
   desert as a man, while guaranteeing Fremen support for the Atreides
   line.
