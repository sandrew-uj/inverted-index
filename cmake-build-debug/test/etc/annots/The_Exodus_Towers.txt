   The Dire Earth Cycle is a trilogy of science fiction novels written by
   American author Jason M. Hough. The series was simultaneously
   released in both the United States (by Del Rey Books) and the United
   Kingdom (by Titan Books). The first book in the series, The Darwin
   Elevator, was released in July 2013, and the two sequels, The Exodus
   Towers and The Plague Forge, were released later that same year. An
   eBook-only release, The Dire Earth: A Novella, acts as a prequel to the
   trilogy and reveals more of the main characters' backgrounds.
