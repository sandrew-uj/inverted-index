   The Jazz Man is the story of a nine-year-old boy named Zeke, who lives
   with his parents on the top floor of a brownstone in Harlem. The story
   begins with Zeke remembering an old home he used to live in down South.
   He later explains how the five flights of stairs he usually walked up
   to get home made his "legs ache beat hot and fast when he first came to
   live there." Over time, he got used to the stairs, but the stairs still
   troubled his mother. At night, when she returned from work, he would
   often hear her struggling to climb up the long flights of stairs.

   One of Zeke's legs is shorter than the other, and "the kids downstairs
   stared at his lame foot and made him feel hot and different." Because
   of this, Zeke skipped school most of the time and remained in his
   apartment staring at windows across the courtyard. He becomes intrigued
   by an apartment with a window that is always closed. He watches this
   window for a while, contemplating who might be moving into the
   apartment. Eventually, a man with a piano moves in. Zeke calls him the
   Jazz Man. The Jazz Man plays all day and night.

   Zeke enjoys the music with his family. The Jazz Man's music helps
   Zeke's mother forget her tiredness and her inability to pay the rent.
   It also helps Zeke's father forget about his unemployment. Zeke watches
   as the Jazz Man jams with his friends, who play the saxophone, drums,
   and trumpet.

   As summer ends, Zeke's mother starts to get more and more irritated by
   the stairs. She argues with Zeke's father because of his recurrent
   unemployment. That night, Zeke's mother crys while reading him a
   bedtime story.

   The next morning Zeke's mother leaves and doesn't return, forcing Zeke
   and his father to learn how to survive on their own. Soon, Zeke's
   father begins neglecting his duties at home and at times stays out for
   many days without leaving Zeke any food. Zeke becomes quieter and
   skinnier. He tells his neighbors that his mother left to visit her rich
   aunt, but everyone, including Zeke, knows that this is a lie.

   After a while, Zeke realizes he hasn't heard from the Jazz Man for some
   time and looks across the courtyard, only to see that he has left the
   apartment. Zeke leaves his building one morning and walks across the
   street. He finds the Jazz Man playing with his friends at a large
   party. Confused, Zeke pinches himself and wakes up to his father's
   voice. Zeke is with his mother and father listening to the Jazz Man
   from their window. Zeke realizes that he has been dreaming the entire
   time.
