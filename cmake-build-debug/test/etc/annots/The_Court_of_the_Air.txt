   When streetwise Molly Templar witnesses a brutal murder at the brothel
   she has recently been apprenticed to, her first instinct is to run back
   to the poorhouse where she grew up. But there she finds her fellow
   orphans butchered, and it slowly dawns on her that she was the real
   target of the attack. For Molly is special, and she is carrying a
   secret that marks her out for destruction by enemies of the state.

   Oliver Brooks has led a sheltered existence in the backwater home of
   his merchant uncle. But when he is framed for his only relative's
   murder, he is forced to flee for his life, accompanied by an agent of
   the mysterious Court of the Air. Chased across the country, Oliver
   finds himself in the company of thieves, outlaws, and spies, and
   gradually learns more about the secret that has blighted his life.

   Soon Molly and Oliver will find themselves battling a grave threat to
   civilization, an ancient power thought to have been quelled millennia
   ago. Their enemies are ruthless and myriad, but the two orphans are
   also aided by indomitable friends.
