     Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours
     are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and
     unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and
     surely drew their plans against us.

   -- H. G. Wells (1898), The War of the Worlds
