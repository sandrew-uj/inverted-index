   A Canticle for Leibowitz is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by
   American writer Walter M. Miller Jr., first published in 1959. Set in a
   Catholic monastery in the desert of the southwestern United States
   after a devastating nuclear war, the book spans thousands of years as
   civilization rebuilds itself. The monks of the Albertian Order of
   Leibowitz preserve the surviving remnants of man's scientific knowledge
   until the world is again ready for it.
