   Dr Conway must deal with an unconscious patient, classification ELPH,
   who may be a cannibal or a demigod, or both. It came from the "other
   galaxy", and the species is well known, almost infamous, to the Ians,
   who are also from another galaxy. It is extremely long-lived, and
   regularly takes complete rejuvenation treatments, including the brain
   and memory, to keep itself young. By doing this, it is practically
   immortal. It, although unconscious, appeared to have the ability to
   negate the most powerful drugs and resist surgery to cure its skin
   condition. This later turned out to be the work of the entity's
   "doctor", who is an intelligent, organised collection of microscopic,
   virus-type cells. Once Doctor Conway realises this, he uses a wooden
   stake to make the ELPH's doctor focus itself in one small location, at
   which time it is removed from the ELPH, informed regarding the
   physiology-problems of its patient, and put back in. The patient, whose
   name is Lonvellin, quickly makes a full recovery, and it leaves to do
   what it does best: bona fide missions that involve taking backwards
   planetary cultures and pulling them up "by their bootstraps". His
   particular mission, this time, is to cure a diseased planet called
   Etla, and he recruits Dr Conway and the "Monitor Corps" to help him.
   When the empire that controls the planet of Etla misinterprets
   Lonvellin's efforts as an act of war, the empire declares war on the
   Sector General space hospital.

   Conway helps organise the evacuation of most of the station's staff and
   patients, and following the death or injury of more senior staff,
   becomes the most senior surviving physician. After a brutal series of
   attacks, and with the hospital on the brink of defeat, a group of
   Federation and Empire soldiers convince Conway to help in a mutiny
   against the Federation commander Dermod. The Empire soldiers had been
   told that the Federation had attacked Etla, rather than trying to help
   it, but seeing the way all casualties were treated equally on the
   station, and in particular witnessing Conway breaking down after
   failing to save the life of an alien Empire soldier, convinced them
   that they had been lied to.
