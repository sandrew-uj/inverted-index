   The novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe
   which has fractured the United States into several nations. The
   protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of
   Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local
   agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan
   city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no
   one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists
   primarily of nine elderly women who "listen and dream". The novel
   describes "a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so
   with the consent of men."^[1] To the south, an overtly-theocratic
   Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war
   against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and
   during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and
   dystopia against each other.

   The story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old
   Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through
   these and other characters, the story explores many elements from
   ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction.
