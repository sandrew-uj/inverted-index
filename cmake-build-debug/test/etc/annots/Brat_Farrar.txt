   The story is about the Ashbys, an English country-squire family. Their
   centuries-old family estate is Latchetts, in the fictional village of
   Clare, near the south coast of England. It takes place in the late
   1940s, after World War II.

   The Ashby family consists of Beatrice Ashby ("Aunt Bee"), a spinster of
   about 50, and the four children of her late brother Bill: Simon, 20;
   Eleanor, 18-19 and the twins Jane and Ruth, 9.

   Bill and his wife, Nora, died eight years earlier. Since then, the
   Ashbys have been short of money. Bee has kept the estate going by
   turning the family stable into a profitable business and combining
   breeding, selling and training horses with riding lessons. When Simon
   turns 21, he will inherit Latchetts and a large trust fund left by his
   mother.

   Simon had a twin brother, Patrick, who is older by a few minutes but
   soon after Bill and Nora had died, Patrick disappeared and left what
   was taken as a suicide note.

   The title character, Brat Farrar, is a young man recently returned to
   England from America. He was a foundling. At the age of 13, the
   orphanage placed him in an office job but he ran away instead. He ended
   up in the western US, where he worked at ranches and stables for
   several years and became an expert horseman until a fall injured his
   leg and he was left with a limp.

   On a street in London, someone completely unknown to Brat greets Brat
   as "Simon". The stranger is Alec Loding, a second-rate actor. He knows
   the Ashby family intimately and sees a way to help his own fortunes.

   Alec's idea is for Brat to impersonate the missing twin, Patrick, and,
   as the elder brother, to claim the trust and the estate. Alec remembers
   a great deal about the Ashbys, Latchetts and the village, which will
   allow him to coach Brat on all of the background details. In return,
   Brat will give him a share of the money. Brat is reluctant but
   eventually agrees, especially when he hears about the horses.

   After two weeks of tutoring, Brat appears at the office of the Ashby
   family solicitor by saying he adopted the name "Brat Farrar" after he
   had run away. He gives his own story as the account of Patrick's
   missing years. Mr. Sandal informs Bee, who meets Brat and is also
   convinced. Over the next two weeks, Sandal verifies Brat's story. The
   family receives "Patrick" at Latchetts.

   His presence leads to the discovery of Patrick's actual fate of being
   murdered by Simon. The final confrontation leaves Simon dead and Brat
   in hospital. There, Bee's Uncle Charles identifies Brat as an
   illegitimate son of Bee's wastrel cousin, Walter.
