   Lovelock is set in a near-future in which humanity is preparing to send
   out its first interstellar colonization ship, called the Ark. Lovelock,
   a genetically- and cybernetically-enhanced capuchin monkey relates the
   story in the first person. Lovelock serves as the "Witness" for Carol
   Jeanne Cocciolone, meaning that his job is to record every waking
   moment of the life of a prominent member of society. As the chief
   Gaiaologist of the Ark, Carol Jeanne is responsible for managing the
   extensive terraforming their new planet will require, integrating the
   terrestrial species needed for the colonists' survival with the
   planet's existing ecology. In the speculative future described by the
   novel, a new field of science, Gaiaology, has come into existence,
   based on the Gaia Hypothesis. Like every Witness, Lovelock has been
   indoctrinated to love and obey his owner unconditionally.
