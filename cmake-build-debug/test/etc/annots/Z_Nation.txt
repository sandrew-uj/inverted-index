   Z Nation begins three years into a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus
   that has already killed most humans. In the days just before society
   fell apart, Murphy was one of three inmates at Portsmouth Naval Prison
   in Kittery, Maine, who were unwilling participants in a
   government-approved experiment. Each inmate was given a different test
   vaccine. Murphy was the only one to survive the vaccine injection. He
   is the only known survivor of a zombie bite who did not turn into a
   zombie, and his blood contains antibodies that are mankind's last and
   best hope for a vaccine. However, he seems to be mutating into some
   form of hybrid between zombie and human--his skin is shedding and his
   body turning blue, and he seems to be able to control and even
   mesmerize certain types of zombies that he encounters; yet he has not
   turned into a full zombie and still maintains control of himself. The
   series revolves around his travels with a small group of survivors
   being led through the apocalypse by Simon "Citizen Z" Cruller, who
   watches the world from his multiple computers. The group is looking to
   use him to solve the zombie pandemic.

   The group must transport Murphy from New York to the world's last known
   functioning Centers for Disease Control research lab in California.
   However, Murphy harbors a dark secret about his condition that
   threatens them all.
