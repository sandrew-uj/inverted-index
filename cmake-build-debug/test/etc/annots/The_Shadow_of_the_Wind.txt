   The novel is actually a story within a story. In the story-world
   "The Shadow of the Wind" is a novel by the obscure Catalan author
   Julian Carax. A boy, Daniel Sempere, sets out to discover Julian's
   other works, and becomes involved in tracing the entire history of
   Carax. Daniel's friend, who goes by the alias of Fermin Romero de
   Torres, was imprisoned and tortured in Montjuic Castle as a result of
   his involvement in espionage against the government during the Civil
   War. He helps Daniel in a number of ways, but their probing into the
   murky past of a number of people who have been either long dead or long
   forgotten unleashes the dark forces of the murderous Inspector Fumero.

   Thus, unravelling a long story that has been buried in the depths of
   oblivion, Daniel and Fermin come across a love story, the beautiful yet
   tragic story of Julian and Penelope, both of whom seem to have been
   missing since 1919--that is, nearly thirty years earlier. Julian, who
   was the son of the hatter Antoni Fortuny and his wife Sophie Carax (but
   preferred to use his mother's last name), and Penelope Aldaya, the only
   daughter of the extremely wealthy Don Ricardo Aldaya and his beautiful,
   narcissistic American wife, developed an instant love for each other
   and lived a clandestine relationship only through casual furtive
   glances and faint smiles for around four years, after which they
   decided to elope to Paris, unaware that the shadows of misfortune had
   been closing in on them ever since they had met. The two lovers are
   doomed to unknown fates just a week before their supposed elopement,
   which is meticulously planned by Julian's best friend, Miquel
   Moliner--also the son of a wealthy father, who had earned much during
   the war, including a bad reputation for selling ammunition. It is
   eventually revealed that Miquel loved Julian more than any brother and
   finally sacrificed his own life for him, having already abandoned his
   desires and his youth for causes of charity and his friend's well-being
   after his elopement to Paris -- although without Penelope, who never
   turned up for the rendezvous.

   Penelope's memory keeps burning in Julian's heart, and this eventually
   forces him to return to Barcelona (in the mid 1930s); however he
   encounters the harsh truth about Penelope, nothing more than a memory
   to those who knew her since she had never been seen or heard of again
   by anyone after 1919. Daniel discovers, from the note Nuria Monfort
   left for him, that Julian and Penelope are actually half-brother and
   sister; her father had an affair with his mother and Julian was the
   result. The worst thing he learns is that after Julian left, Penelope's
   parents imprisoned her because they were ashamed of her committing
   incest with him and she was pregnant with his child. Penelope gave
   birth to a son named David Aldaya, who was stillborn. Penelope died in
   childbirth, due to her parents' ignoring her cries for help, and her
   body was placed in the family crypt along with her child's. When
   returning to the Aldaya Mansion, Julian is enraged and embittered by
   the news of his love's death along with their child's. He hates every
   wasted second of his life without Penelope and hates his books all the
   more. He begins to burn all of his novels and calls himself Lain
   Coubert.

   After finishing reading the book, Daniel marries Beatriz "Bea" Aguilar,
   whom he has loved for a long time, in 1956. Soon after, Bea gives birth
   to a son. Daniel names his son Julian Sempere, in honor of Julian
   Carax. In 1966, Daniel takes Julian to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books,
   where The Shadow of the Wind is kept.
