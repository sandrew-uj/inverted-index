   When he was rescued by his own people at the end of Son of the Stars,
   the alien boy Clonar left behind his wrecked spaceship's IVP hyperwave
   radio. Now his friend, Ron Barron, is working with the United States
   Air Force to develop their own version of it. As he works on the device
   Ron hears Clonar calling from his home planet of Rorla and inviting Ron
   and his family to come attend a meeting of the Galactic Federation.
   Nine days later Ron, his father George, his mother, his ten-year-old
   sister Francie, and Anne Martin, his girlfriend are picked up by the
   crew of a giant discus-shaped starship and taken to Rorla, the Planet
   of Light, where the Barrons and Anne are obliged to live in a colony of
   houses that has been established for the conference delegates.

   On their first day in the colony Ron and Anne meet Borah, an affable
   bear-like creature from Haddon's Galaxy and George meets a pair of
   swashbuckling cyanide-breathers named Barmese and Athol, whom Borah
   describes as intergalactic desperadoes. They also discover that the
   director of the colony is Tenarg, the Fleet Commander who, a year
   earlier, had ordered the destruction of Earth. Still filled with
   disdain for the people of Earth, Tenarg intends to make the Barrons'
   stay on Rorla as miserable as possible.

   Taking their cues from Tenarg, the other delegates shun the Barrons and
   nothing the Barrons can do changes that situation. In desperation
   George consults Barmese and Athol on the situation and is drawn into a
   plot to assassinate Tenarg. When it appears that the plot has
   succeeded, the outlaws flee.

   From traces of toxic gas found in Tenarg and George's bodies, the
   Rorlans quickly deduce what happened and who was responsible. Ron and
   Clonar join the crew of a Rorlan interstellar Patrol ship to go in
   pursuit of the desperadoes to a poisonous hellworld, from which the
   Patrolmen bring Barmese back to Rorla for trial.

   After the trial of Barmese Ron comes to understand that the conference
   is a sham. It was merely a means by which the Rorlans could subject the
   delegates, especially those from Earth, to a stress test, to determine
   whether they were truly ready to join the Galactic Federation. Ron is
   outraged by the deceit, but then, prodded by Anne, realizes that he was
   just as deceitful, hiding his true nature under a false desire to bring
   Rorlan technology back to Earth.

   Chastened, Ron asks their Rorlan advisor what Earth can contribute to
   the Galactic Federation. The advisor tells Ron that the aging
   Federation needs Earth's energy, drive, and vitality to rejuvenate
   itself. Earth will be admitted to the Federation because, instead of
   seeking a handout as Ron originally intended, the people of Earth will
   contribute their own talent and will work together with the other races
   of the Federation as equals.
