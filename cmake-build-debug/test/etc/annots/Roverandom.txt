   Roverandom is a novella by J. R. R. Tolkien, originally told in 1925,
   about the adventures of a young dog, Rover. In the story, an irritable
   wizard turns Rover into a toy, and Rover goes to the Moon and under the
   sea in order to find the wizard again to turn him back into a
   normal-sized dog. The author wrote Roverandom for his son Michael to
   amuse him upon the loss of his favourite toy, a little leaden dog which
   he lost on a beach of grey shingle stones the same size and colour as
   the toy. The work is in tone a children's story, but contains many
   allusions and references in the manner of Farmer Giles of Ham.

   It was submitted for publication in 1937 after the success of The
   Hobbit, but was not published for over sixty years, finally being
   released in 1998. Roverandom was included in the collection Tales from
   the Perilous Realm from its 2009 reprinting onwards.
