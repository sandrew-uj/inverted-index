   "Bread Givers" a three-volume novel of a Jewish-American female
   coming-of-age story set in the 1920s written by Anzia Yezierska.
   10-year-old Sara Smolinsky is the protagonist and narrator of Bread
   Givers. Sara lives in a tenement with her Orthodox Jewish father, Reb
   Smolinsky, her mother, Shenah, and her three older sisters Bessie,
   Fania, and Mashah in the Lower East Side of New York City. The
   Smolinskys are destitute; Sara's father devotes his time to the study
   of the Torah and Jewish sacred texts and refuses to help provide for
   the family's income. Sara's mother rents out the front room of their
   tenement to boarders after convincing her husband to move his sacred
   texts under her bed in order to have money to pay for rent.

   The Smolinskys' struggle to pay their rent to the landlord, resulting
   in a confrontation between the landlord's rent collector and Reb
   Smolinsky. The rent collector demands the two months of past-due rent
   while Reb Smolinsky recites a hymn. Reb Smolinsky explains he does not
   have the money. In anger, the rent collector slams the Torah shut,
   causing the book to fall at her feet. Reb Smolinsky slaps her twice in
   anger, causing her to seek out the police to arrest him. Reb
   Smolinsky's short absence forces Sara to sell herring on Hester Street
   for income. When Reb Smolinsky returns home free of charges, the
   community on Hester Street admires him for hitting the rent
   collector.

   Each of Sara's three older sisters falls in love and their father
   rejects each of their suitors. Reb Smolinsky decides to arrange
   marriages for each of his three older daughters despite them already
   being in love. He uses the arranged marriages for his own financial
   gain even though his daughters are unhappy. Sara witnesses the damage
   her father causes on her sisters by intervening in all of their
   relationships and makes a promise to herself to marry someone of her
   own choosing.

   Reb Smolinsky's financial gain from Bessie's marriage causes him to
   quickly search for a business bargain. In the "Ghetto News" He reads an
   ad stating that a grocery store was for sale for $400 in Elizabeth, New
   Jersey. He decides to purchase the store without his wife's opinion,
   despite her pleading to go with him to make the deal. Once the
   transaction of the bargain is completed, Reb Smolinsky, his wife, and
   Sara discover that most of the stock in the store was fake and that
   they were swindled by the prior owner. Sara and her mother work in the
   store, but must confront with Reb Smolinsky's lack of business sense.
   He chases customers away from the store with his preaching and
   scolding. Eventually, Sara becomes frustrated with her father's
   stubbornness and she decides to move back to New York City alone, where
   she decides to become a teacher.

   Sara creates a rigid daily schedule, causing her to ignore her family.
   She makes an effort to be a part of the social circles around her but
   is not accepted by her American peers. Rejected, she decides to focus
   on her studies. Coincidentally Max Goldstein, a business partner of
   Fania's husband, begins to pursue Sara. Sara enjoys her time with
   Max but realizes that they are not suited for one another because he
   does not understand Sara's need to complete her college education. Sara
   breaks up with Max and decides to focus solely on her studies.

   Sara soon graduates from college with a teaching degree and with $1,000
   that she won in an essay contest. Feeling successful, Sara returns home
   to find her mother fatally ill. After her mother's death, her father
   remarries, but learns that his new wife, the widow Mrs. Feinstein, is
   after his late wife's lodge money. Sara and her sisters become furious,
   viewing the quick marriage as a dishonor to their mother, and vow to
   not see their father. Sara begins teaching, but receives a letter from
   her father's new wife seeking financial help. Reb Smolinsky's daughters
   refuse to support him or his new wife.

   Mrs. Feinstein, angered that Sara refuses to give her money, writes a
   letter to the principal of the school, Hugo Seelig, where Sara is
   teaching in an attempt to discredit her. Hugo sympathizes with Sara and
   they begin to date. During a dinner, Hugo and Sara find out they are
   countrymen: Jewish Polish American. Another night when Sara is on her
   way to have dinner with Hugo she finds her father extremely ill, lying
   in the gutter and selling chewing gum. Concerned, Sara walks her father
   home and begins to care for him by asking time off from teaching. Sara
   realizes that her father does need a wife to care for him and convinces
   her sisters to help support their father and his new wife. Reb
   Smolinsky later reveals to Sara that he is unhappy. Conflicted, Sara
   asks her father to come live with her and Hugo. Reb Smolinsky is
   concerned about whether he can live with Sara stating, promise to keep
   sacred all that is sacred to him. The three-volume novel ends with
   Sara and Hugo walking home agreeing to let Reb Smolinsky move in with
   them.
