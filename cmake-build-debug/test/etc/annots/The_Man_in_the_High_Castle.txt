   In 1962, 15 years after Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany have won World
   War II, Robert "Bob" Childan owns an Americana antique shop in San
   Francisco, California (located in the Japanese-occupied Pacific States
   of America), which is most commonly frequented by the Japanese, who
   make a fetish of romanticized American cultural artifacts. Childan is
   contacted by Nobusuke Tagomi, a high-ranking Japanese trade official,
   who is seeking a gift to impress a visiting Swedish industrialist named
   Baynes. Childan's store is stocked in part with counterfeit antiques
   from the Wyndam-Matson Corporation, a metalworking company. Frank Frink
   (formerly Fink), a secretly Jewish-American veteran of World War II,
   has just been fired from the Wyndam-Matson factory, when he agrees to
   join a former co-worker to begin a handcrafted jewellery business.
   Meanwhile, Frink's ex-wife, Juliana, works as a judo instructor in
   Canon City, Colorado (in the neutral buffer zone of Mountain States),
   where she begins a sexual relationship with an Italian truck driver and
   ex-soldier, Joe Cinnadella. Throughout the book, many of these
   characters frequently make important decisions using prophetic messages
   they interpret from the I Ching, a Chinese cultural import. Many
   characters are also reading a widely banned yet extremely popular new
   novel, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, which depicts an alternate history
   in which the Allies won World War II in 1945, a concept that amazes and
   intrigues its readers.

   Frink reveals that the Wyndam-Matson Corporation has been supplying
   Childan with counterfeit antiques, which works to blackmail
   Wyndam-Matson for money to finance Frink's new jewelry venture. Tagomi
   and Baynes meet, but Baynes repeatedly delays any real business as they
   await an expected third party from Japan. Suddenly, the public receives
   news of the death of the Chancellor of Germany, Martin Bormann, after a
   short illness. Childan tentatively, on consignment, takes some of
   Frink's "authentic" new metalwork and attempts to curry favour with a
   Japanese client, who surprisingly considers Frink's jewelry immensely
   spiritually alive. Juliana and Joe take a road trip to Denver, Colorado
   and Joe impulsively decides they should go on a side-trip to meet the
   mysterious Hawthorne Abendsen, author of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy,
   who supposedly lives in a guarded fortress-like estate called the "High
   Castle" in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Soon, Joseph Goebbels is announced as the
   new German Chancellor.

   Baynes and Tagomi finally meet their Japanese contact as the Nazi
   secret police, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), close in to arrest Baynes,
   who is revealed to be a Nazi defector named Rudolf Wegener. Wegener
   warns his contact, a famed Japanese general, of Operation Dandelion, an
   upcoming Goebbels-approved plan for the Nazis to launch a surprise
   attack on the Japanese Home Islands, to obliterate the whole empire for
   good. As Frink is exposed as a Jew and arrested by San Francisco
   police, Wegener and Tagomi are confronted by two SD agents, both of
   whom Tagomi shoots dead with an antique American pistol. Back in
   Colorado, Joe abruptly changes his appearance and mannerisms before the
   trip to the High Castle, leading Juliana to infer that he intends to
   murder Abendsen. Joe confirms this, revealing himself to be an
   undercover Swiss Nazi assassin. Juliana mortally wounds Joe and drives
   off to warn Abendsen of the threat to his life.

   Wegener flies back to Germany and learns that Reinhard Heydrich (a
   member of the anti-Dandelion faction) has launched a coup against
   Goebbels, possibly installing himself as Chancellor. Tagomi remains
   shaken by the shootout and goes to Childan to sell back the gun he used
   in the fight; instead, sensing the energy from one of Frink's jewelry
   items, Tagomi impulsively buys it from Childan. Tagomi then undergoes a
   spiritually intense experience during which he momentarily perceives an
   alternative-history version of San Francisco. Later, Tagomi meets with
   the German consul in San Francisco and frees the imprisoned Frink, whom
   Tagomi has never met, by refusing to sign his extradition order to
   Germany. Juliana soon has her own spiritual experience when she arrives
   in Cheyenne. She discovers that Abendsen now lives in a normal house
   with his family, having left behind the High Castle due to a change of
   outlook; he no longer preoccupies himself with thoughts that he might
   soon be assassinated. After dodging many of Juliana's questions about
   his inspiration for his novel, Abendsen finally confesses that he used
   the I Ching to guide his writing of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy. Before
   leaving, Juliana infers then that "Truth" wrote the book to reveal the
   "Inner Truth" that Japan and Germany really lost World War II.
