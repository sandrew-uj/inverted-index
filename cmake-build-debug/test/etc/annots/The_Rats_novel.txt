   Herbert became inspired to write The Rats in early 1972, while watching
   Tod Browning's Dracula; specifically, after seeing the scene in which
   Renfield describes his recurring nightmare about hordes of rats.
   Linking the film to childhood memories he had of rats in the London
   suburbs, Herbert stated in later interviews that he wrote the book
   primarily as a pastime: "It seemed like a good idea at the time, I was
   as naive as that." The manuscript was typed by Herbert's wife
   Eileen, who sent it off after nine months to nine different
   publishers.
