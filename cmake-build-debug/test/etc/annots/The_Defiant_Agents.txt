   The alien library discovered in the previous novel proved to have
   locations of many unknown worlds. Finding the secure location of planet
   Topaz compromised, Apache operatives, including Travis Fox, are sent on
   an emergency trip by Earth with a mind-altering machine, Redax, that
   crash lands. They discover they have the ability to communicate with
   the coyotes, but have no idea why they are there.

   They encounter Russians who have undergone similar treatment, and
   similarly lacking their memories, who were taken from the days of the
   Mongolian Golden Horde. With this common experience, they join forces
   against the modern Russians doing mind-control. Memories gradually
   return. After finding alien technology too dangerous for the Russians
   to have, Travis seeks allies. They lay a successful trap for the
   Russian Redax controllers. Defeating the source of Russian control, the
   allies agree to guard the alien technology from outsiders in the years
   to come.
