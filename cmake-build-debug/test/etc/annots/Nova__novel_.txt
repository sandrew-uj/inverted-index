   By the year 3172, political power in the galaxy is split between two
   factions: the older Earth-based Draco and the historically younger
   Pleiades Federation. Both have interests in the even newer Outer
   Colonies, where mines produce trace amounts of the prized power source
   Illyrion, the superheavy material essential to starship travel and
   terraforming planets.

   Caught in a feud between aristocratic and economically powerful
   families, a scarred and obsessed captain from the Pleiades, Lorq Von
   Ray, recruits a disparate crew of misfits to aid him in the race with
   his arch-enemy, Prince Red from Draco's Red Shift Ltd., to gain
   economic leadership by securing a vastly greater amount of Illyrion
   directly from the heart of a stellar nova. In doing so, Von Ray will
   shift the balance of power of the existing galactic order, which will
   bring about the downfall of the Red family as well as end Earth's
   dominance over interstellar politics.

   As the title indicates, the central metaphor for the novel is a nova:
   the destructive implosion/explosion of an entire sun, which,
   paradoxically, while it destroys most of a solar system, also creates
   new elements. In the book, at the eruption of a nova, not only do the
   laws of physics break down, but so do the laws of politics and
   psychology. This idea permeates the entire plot and storyline.

   The characters follow a quest plot line, in which they visit several
   worlds to gain information necessary to achieve their goal, all the
   while pursued by the Red family.

   Although the novel does not indulge the literary experimentation found
   in Delany's later books, it maintains a high level of innovation. Some
   chapters end or begin in mid-sentence. Also, the point of view
   regularly shifts between Lorq, Katin, and the Mouse. Each page in the
   book carries a header that gives the year and location of the scene on
   the page itself (e.g., "Draco, Earth, Paris, 3162"). This is useful
   because of the flashbacks in the long journey around the galaxy.
