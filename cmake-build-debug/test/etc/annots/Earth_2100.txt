   Lucy is born on June 2, 2009 (changed to January 1, 2009 in subsequent
   airings), in the suburbs of Miami and is still alive in the year 2100.
   In 2015, negotiations on climate change action breaks down between the
   West and India/China as the former is unwilling to transfer clean
   technology to the latter, while Lucy's family moves out of the suburbs
   and into an apartment in Miami after chronic gas shortages. A few
   months later a powerful hurricane named Linda hits and levels much of
   Miami, killing thousands of people. She and her parents move to San
   Diego. She becomes an EMT and meets her husband, Josh, an engineer,
   during a protest against high water prices of California desalinated
   seawater in 2030 (Las Vegas had run dry).

   In 2050, they and their nineteen-year-old daughter Molly move to New
   York City by car, passing desperate Texans begging for rides north,
   which is refused by the trio. One pulls a gun on Molly, but others in
   the car/truck convoy point automatic weapons on the desperate man, who
   is forced to back off. While the others in the convoy make it to
   Canada, New York City is a marvel of clean power, clean transit, and
   community gardening. Josh sets to work building a flood barrier to hold
   back the ocean, but the CO warming unleashes trapped methane in the
   Arctic, which causes even faster, non-linear warming.

   An attempt to use sulfur dioxide as a last resort to cool the planet is
   called off when it is found to destroy the ozone layer. Lucy finds and
   helps quarantine and neutralize a strange new disease, and Molly moves
   upstate to an agricultural community. During a storm at high tide in
   2075, Josh is killed while trying to fix a stuck gate, and New York
   City is flooded. Lucy refuses Molly's offer to live with her, her
   husband and son. Starving people among the rotting flood damage set the
   stage for the return of the disease Lucy saw, now called "Caspian
   Fever."

   Caspian Fever soon becomes a pandemic and kills so many people on Earth
   that the human population starts shrinking, international trade stops
   and basic services begin to break down. Eventually the grid fails,
   modern technology stops working, and unrest follows (a plot
   contradiction as it was stated earlier that all technology in New York
   were self-sustaining), it dawns on Lucy and every American that there
   is no Federal response, no National Guard, no soldiers to keep order.
   Democracy and civilization at the national level have died in America.

   Lucy leaves the city with some friends and a dog in the 2080s, and
   eventually finds her daughter, now a widow like herself, and her
   grandson. Initially there is no communication with the outside world,
   until someone set up a two-way radio discovering former cities have
   become relatively advanced walled enclaves, while surrounded by masses
   of poverty. In 2100, Lucy ponders what strange advice to pass along to
   her grandson, now denied the education she took for granted, as she is
   the oldest person in the world.
