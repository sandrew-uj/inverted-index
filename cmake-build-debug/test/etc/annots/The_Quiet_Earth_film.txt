   5 July begins as a normal winter morning near Hamilton, New Zealand. At
   6:12 a.m., the sun darkens for a moment, and a red light surrounded by
   darkness is briefly seen.

   Zac Hobson (Bruno Lawrence) is a scientist employed by Delenco, part of
   an international consortium working on "Project Flashlight", an
   experiment to create a global energy grid. He awakens abruptly; when he
   turns on his radio, he is unable to receive any transmissions. He gets
   dressed and drives into the deserted city. Investigating a fire, he
   discovers the wreckage of a passenger jet, but there are no bodies,
   only empty seats.

   Zac enters his laboratory but fails to contact any of the other labs
   around the world. Descending to an underground lab, he discovers the
   dead body of a colleague at a control panel; a monitor displays the
   message "Project Flashlight Complete". The mass disappearance seems to
   coincide with the moment Flashlight was activated. The lab is suddenly
   and automatically sealed because of radiation, so he improvises a bomb
   to free himself. He listens to his own voice on a tape recorder
   describing the project as having "phenomenal destructive potential",
   then notes: "Zac Hobson, July 5th. One: there has been a malfunction in
   Project Flashlight with devastating results. Two: it seems I am the
   only person left on Earth." From this point onward, he refers to the
   crucial moment and its result as "The Effect".

   After a week of vain attempts to contact another human being, Zac moves
   into a mansion and acquires numerous goods from a mall, but his mental
   state begins to deteriorate. He puts on a woman's night gown and
   alternates between exhilaration and despair. He assembles cardboard
   cutouts of famous people (including Adolf Hitler, Elizabeth II, and
   Pope John Paul II), plays a loud fanfare and cheers from large
   speakers, and addresses the cutouts from a balcony. He declares himself
   "President of this Quiet Earth", then goes on a destructive rampage
   after the power blacks out. He bursts into a church, shoots a statue of
   Jesus off a crucifix, and announces that he is God. After accidentally
   crushing an empty pram with an enormous earthmover, he puts the barrel
   of a shotgun into his mouth but finally comes to his senses.

   Zac settles into a more normal routine. One morning, a young woman
   named Joanne (Alison Routledge) appears. Zac is attracted to her, and
   after a few days together they have sex. They scour the city and find a
   third survivor, a large Maori man named Api (Pete Smith). The three
   determine why they survived: at the instant of The Effect, they were
   all at the moment of death: Api was being drowned in a fight, Joanne
   was electrocuted by a faulty hairdryer, and Zac had overdosed on pills
   in a suicide attempt. He had realized the experiment posed serious
   dangers and was guilt-ridden for not speaking out.

   A love triangle develops, but Zac is more concerned about his
   observations: universal physical constants are changing, causing the
   Sun's output to fluctuate. Zac fears The Effect will occur again and
   decides to destroy the Delenco facility in an attempt to stop it. The
   three put aside their personal conflicts and drive a truckload of
   explosives to the installation, only to be stopped at the perimeter
   when Zac detects dangerous levels of ionising radiation emanating from
   the plant. He says that he will go to town to retrieve a remote control
   device that will allow them to send the truck into the facility.

   While Zac is gone, Joanne and Api have sex. Afterward, Api tells Joanne
   that he will sacrifice himself by driving the truck; he doubts that
   Zac's device will be capable of controlling the vehicle. They then hear
   the truck and realise that Zac did not go to town after all. He drives
   the truck onto the weakened roof of the underground portion of the
   laboratory, which collapses. Just as the effect reaches a maximum, he
   triggers the explosives.

   Once again a red light is seen surrounded by the dark tunnel. Zac finds
   himself lying face down on a beach. There are strange cloud formations,
   resembling waterspouts, rising out of the ocean. As he walks to the
   water's edge, an enormous ringed planet slowly appears over the
   horizon.
