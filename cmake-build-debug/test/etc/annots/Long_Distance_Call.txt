   Billy's beloved grandmother visits for his fifth birthday party,
   despite being deathly frail. She gives the boy a toy telephone, telling
   him that he can always talk to her on it. She then becomes gravely weak
   and delusional, failing to recognize her son Chris and imagining that
   Billy is instead before dying.

   Billy's parents, especially his mother Sylvia, become concerned when he
   spends all his time on the toy telephone talking to his grandmother. He
   says that she tells him she is lonely and misses him. While the parents
   are at her funeral, Billy runs out in front of a car. The driver, who
   barely manages to swerve out of the way, reports that Billy said
   someone told him to do it. When his father asks him why he did it,
   Billy says he does not know. Chris tries to explain that Grandma has
   died, and asks that he not use the toy phone in front of his mother. He
   discusses with Sylvia about how his mother had two children before him,
   both of whom died, which is why she was so attached to him and
   especially Billy, who reminded her of Chris and helped her forget years
   of loss.

   That night, Sylvia is awakened by the sound of Billy talking and
   laughing. Going to his room, she grabs the phone out of his hands, but
   is shocked when she hears Grandma on it. Billy runs out of the room.
   Chris and Sylvia look for him, and are horrified to find him face down
   in their garden pool.

   An ambulance attendant informs the parents that Billy's chances are not
   good. Chris goes upstairs to Billy's room, picks up the toy phone, and
   begs his mother to give Billy back and allow him to experience life. He
   pleads that if she really loves him, she will let him live. Downstairs,
   the attendants' efforts to revive Billy succeed, and when Chris joins
   them, he and Sylvia embrace, relieved.
