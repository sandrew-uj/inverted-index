   This time, when he reaches the Green Star planet, he sees a boy about
   16 spreadeagled to a branch with rawhide, so as to be killed by
   marauding animals (or to die of starvation, so his body may be
   scavenged). A huge scorpion or phuol attacks the boy and then withdraws
   (waiting for its venom to paralyse, so it can then consume his
   still-living flesh later).

   At that point, a man comes out from concealment behind branches, kills
   the phuol with a lightning-emitting wand, and rescues the boy in a
   sky-sled, which the narrator follows to a city which appears dead
   (later finding out this is so). The rescuer applies salves and
   injections to the boy, who dies during the night (known to the
   narrator, but not the rescuer) whereupon the narrator takes possession
   of the just-dead body; it takes him a little while to reconcile the
   memories of this new body, whose name he finds to be Karn the Hunter
   (of Red Dragon Tribe--the "Red Dragon" being a reference to the ythid),
   with his soul memories from his earlier incarnation as Chong The
   Mighty.

   Karn soon finds out that the dead city (known as Sotaspra) is a taboo
   area of the planet, only visited (or inhabited) by some
   scientists/savants such as his rescuer Sarchimus (self-titled "The
   Wise"). Indeed, Sarchimus considers all of the other savants of the
   city as rivals, chief of them Hume "Of The Many Eyes". Sarchimus warns
   Karn not to go exploring on his own--when Karn disobeys, he discovers
   the city is full of many mutant creatures, including a "death-fungus"
   which he narrowly misses, "crawler-vines" which try to strangle him and
   an amorphous creature Sarchimus calls "saloog", all of which were
   formed due to radiation from the crystals of which Sotaspra was
   constructed (when the crystals had energy, and the city was alive).
   Karn is astute enough to understand that Sarchimus did not rescue him
   for altruistic reasons.

   Sometime later, when Sarchimus has gone on an errand, Karn goes to
   another area where Sarchimus has forbidden him access--a set of doors
   sealed with Sarchimus' symbol, a scarlet hand. Doing so, he discovers
   that Sarchimus' experiments are partly guided by an original inhabitant
   of the city.

   Karn had earlier seen some statues of winged humanoids in very
   commonplace positions--but these were made of chalk, a rather brittle
   material; the inhabitant is the last living member of these "genii" as
   Karn thinks of them, over a million years old. The immortal, Zarqa the
   kalood (meaning "flying ones") tells him that the statues are the
   result of a failed experiment of immortality which produced a compound
   known as "Elixir of Light". Even correctly formulated, the Elixir
   lengthened the lives of male kaloodha but sterilised them as a
   price--while having no effect on the females, thus causing a slow
   extinction of this noble race; the statues are the result of consuming
   this elixir mixed lacking a crucial ingredient. Sarchimus has
   much-tortured Zarqa to find out the formulation--at the time Karn finds
   him, he has revealed all except one ingredient but not the correct
   formula. Karn is also told that there is another human captive, a
   Phaolonian, in the tower (who he finds at a later
   opportunity--recognising by face, but not by name--to be named
   Janchan).

   Eventually, Sarchimus treats Karn to a drugged feast (and then chains
   him) as a prelude to testing the Elixir on him--boasting that Zarqa (he
   doesn't reveal the name, as he does not know of Karn's knowledge) has
   revealed the correct formula to him. Karn is invigorated and
   strengthened greatly by the Elixir, but cannot break the chains
   fastened to him. Pleased at this sight, Sarchimus consumes the
   rest--and finds himself petrifying to chalk. Zarqa (who had been held
   in an energy-barrier set to Sarchimus' frequency) then releases Karn
   (and reveals to him the missing ingredient to be a component distilled
   from phuol venom--Karn was protected by residues of the venom from the
   stinging he had earlier received), who then releases Janchan. The three
   then find a map to Ardha and Phaolon--which they find are about 3,000
   farasang (a unit of time misused by Laonese also for distance) away.

   Janchan enters Ardha and obtains employment as a soldier. In this
   employ, he finds Niamh (who was recaptured by Siona's band after her
   escape attempt and then given to Arjala the "goddess" of Ardha as
   captive--due to rivalry between Arjala and Akhmim, this allowed some
   power-josting). Soldiers in Arjala's employ have also captured Zarqa
   and display him as an amphasand, a mythical creature sacred to the
   Laonese. Janchan makes careful plans to rescue Niamh and Zarqa.

   Karn meanwhile has been attacked by a large bumblebee or zzumalak,
   which he mortally wounds--only to land in a swimming pool where the bee
   drops him. Taking some coins from this house, he runs into a trio of
   men who fight and capture him--who turn out to be of the assassin
   guild. One of this trio, Klygon, soon trains Karn in the arts of the
   guild. The chief of the guild, an obese man named Gurjan Tor (who
   most-closely resembles Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars), asks Karn to kill
   Niamh and Zarqa with a poisoned stiletto--and posts Klygon as his
   "partner" to ensure that Karn will not fluff the job or run away.

   Karn and Klygon fly to the temple tower (where Niamh is held) on
   zaiphs, and find Janchan and Zarqa in the process of rescuing Niamh.
   Janchan's rescue goes somewhat awry as Arjala is present with two (very
   large, muscular eunuch) temple guards. Janchan's plans have been made
   in order to AVOID having a fight with these toughs (as he particularly
   fears they may raise an alarm); in desperation, he throws a lamp at
   one, breaking both it and the eunuch's skull (and discovers that the
   doomed eunuchs are also mute). The dead eunuch's body strikes Arjala
   knocking her unconscious--and forcing Janchan to rescue her as well. He
   quickly grabs Arjala and Niamh and puts them in the sky-sled with
   Zarqa.

   Karn who has seen this is now afraid that Klygon may kill him--as
   promised to Gurjan Tor.

   The cliffhanger above is the starting point for the series' third
   novel, By the Light of the Green Star.
