   James Joyce in 1915

   Born into a middle-class family in Dublin, Ireland, James Joyce
   (1882-1941) excelled as a student, graduating from University College,
   Dublin, in 1902. He moved to Paris to study medicine, but soon gave it
   up. He returned to Ireland at his family's request as his mother was
   dying of cancer. Despite her pleas, the impious Joyce and his brother
   Stanislaus refused to make confession or take communion, and when she
   passed into a coma they refused to kneel and pray for her. After a
   stretch of failed attempts to get published and launch his own
   newspaper, Joyce then took jobs teaching, singing and reviewing
   books.

   Joyce made his first attempt at a novel, Stephen Hero, in early
   1904. That June he saw Nora Barnacle for the first time walking
   along Nassau Street. Their first date was on June 16, the same date
   that his novel Ulysses takes place. Almost immediately, Joyce and
   Nora were infatuated with each other and they bonded over their shared
   disapproval of Ireland and the Church. Nora and Joyce eloped to
   continental Europe, first staying in Zuerich before settling for ten
   years in Trieste (then in Austria-Hungary), where he taught English. In
   March 1905, Joyce was transferred to the Berlitz School In Trieste,
   presumably because of threats of spies in Austria. There Nora gave
   birth to their children, George in 1905 and Lucia in 1907, and Joyce
   wrote fiction, signing some of his early essays and stories "Stephen
   Daedalus". The short stories he wrote made up the collection Dubliners
   (1914), which took about eight years to be published due to its
   controversial nature. While waiting on Dubliners to be published,
   Joyce reworked the core themes of the novel Stephen Hero he had begun
   in Ireland in 1904 and abandoned in 1907 into A Portrait, published in
   1916, a year after he had moved back to Zuerich in the midst of the
   First World War.
