   In Rocheworld, a small group of civilian and military personnel crew
   carries out humanity's first manned exploration of another star system.
   Against the protests of General (later Senator) Beauregard Darlington
   Winthrop III, the mission begins under the command of Major General
   Virginia "Jinjur" Jones and George G. Gudunov. Winthrop however, eager
   to fulfill a personal vendetta against Gudunov, uses his considerable
   influence to get Colonel Alan Armstrong, who had hoped to be second in
   command just for the sake of it, on the crew with the intention of
   promoting him after the mission is on its way. This plan is foiled
   however, and the expedition proceeds on its one way mission to
   Barnard's Star, where planets have been discovered by Robot Probes.

   Using a laser-pumped light sail spacecraft known as Prometheus, the
   journey to their destination of Barnard's star lasts 40 years. The crew
   use a drug called "No-Die" which slows their aging process, whilst
   proportionately lowering their effective I.Q., but allowing them to
   arrive only a decade physically older than when they left.

   However, all does not go as planned, and soon a dangerous disease
   erupts among the crew. The ship's doctor, William Wang, is taken off
   No-Die, where he sacrifices himself to treat the rest of the crew.

   When the ship arrives at Barnard, they begin their exploration,
   deploying various Robot probes. David Greystroke, the ships computer
   engineer as well as a talented sono-video composer, creates a free fall
   musical and visual composition called "Flight", with Arielle Trudeau,
   the pilot of the Dragonfly Spaceplane, performing.

   A fraction of the crew, led by George, visit the double planet
   Rocheworld, landing a Surface Lander and Ascent Module (SLAM) on the
   water-free lobe, dubbed Roche (French for rock as well as the name of
   the French mathematician who worked on Roche limits). After exploring
   Roche, they again split up, and one group journeys via the space-plane
   Dragonfly to the other lobe, Eau (French for water), which is covered
   almost entirely by ocean. The crew are caught in a violent storm that
   causes their plane to experience a crash water-landing. The flooded
   propulsion systems of the space-plane are unable to provide enough
   thrust to break free and take off from the ocean surface. The crew
   decide to use the plane's lift fans as propellers to make their way to
   the inner pole of the double planet, where the gravitation from the
   other lobe of the double planet should help them to break free and
   allow rendezvous with the remaining crew in the lander at the zero
   point between the two lobes.

   While making this journey, the space-plane attracts the attention of
   one of the native species of the planet: the very intelligent, but
   technologically lacking, Flouwen. The Flouwen and the artificial
   intelligence aboard the space-plane establish communications and the
   two species begin to exchange cultural and scientific knowledge. The
   crew witness the birth of a Flouwen youngling, while one crew member,
   Shirley Everett, takes a ride on ClearLZWhiteLZWhistle (White Whistler)
   a Flouwen who understands the technologically oriented humans more than
   the others of the pod, and who is fascinated by their technology.
   Unfortunately for Shirley, the Flouwen morphs into rock form while
   thinking, leaving her stranded in the middle of the ocean and forcing a
   rescue operation to be mounted.

   The Flouwen realize the humans are travelling to the pole and warn the
   humans that they are approaching a period where the configuration of
   the star and planets of the system allow for a phenomenon where the
   ocean on the water lobe of Rocheworld can partially flow to the rocky
   lobe, due to the change in the gravitational equipotential. They try to
   stop the humans from continuing into this violent event by pinning the
   spacecraft to the ammonia-water ocean floor with ice as ballast (water
   ice sinks in the less dense ammonia-water solution of the ocean).
   However, the humans realize that the interplanetary waterfall poses a
   threat to the crew remaining on Roche. Fortunately, the tidal stresses
   cause nearby dormant volcanoes to become active again. This melts an
   underwater glacier and floods the area with warm water, upon which the
   ice floats off the plane. The crew manages to get airborne and takes
   advantage of the changing equipotential to return to Roche. They
   rendezvous with the lander just as water is reaching it.

   The Epilogue is set years later, as a follow on mission arrives. This
   sequence was later expanded and included in the last sequel novel,
   Rescued from Paradise
