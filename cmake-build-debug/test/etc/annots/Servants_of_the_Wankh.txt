   After his starship and crewmates are blown up, Adam Reith is marooned
   on a planet inhabited by four advanced, mutually hostile, alien
   species, the Chasch, Wankh, Dirdir and native Pnume, as well as various
   groups of humans. In his quest to return home, he acquires three human
   companions (as detailed in City of the Chasch): Traz Onmale, a taciturn
   teenage barbarian chieftain, Ankhe at afram Anacho, a flamboyant,
   fugitive Dirdirman, and Ylin-Ylan, a beautiful young Yao woman whom he
   rescued from a man-hating religious sect.

   Ylin-Ylan persuades Reith, her lover, into taking her back to Cath.
   With her wealthy father's backing, Reith hopes to be able to build a
   spaceship. As time passes, however, their relationship cools. Anacho
   explains that Yao society is extremely status conscious, and the closer
   they get to her homeland, the more Ylin-Ylan dreads being associated
   with (to her) gauche, uncouth companions. Her inner conflict is
   exacerbated when they meet Dordolio, a Yao cavalier, who accompanies
   them on the sea voyage to Cath. Her attempts to distance herself from
   them, with Dordolio's assistance, all fail disastrously. Finally,
   unable to bear the shame any longer, she takes refuge in awaile, a
   murderous rampage not uncommon among her people, which ends with her
   throwing herself into the sea.

   Reith and his friends continue on to Cath and notify Ylin-Ylan's father
   of her demise. They are coolly received, but are eventually given
   50,000 sequins (the universal currency of Tschai) as a reward.

   Unimpressed with Yao engineering, Reith recruits a crew from those who
   had worked for the Wankh, to try to steal a Wankh spaceship. The
   attempt almost succeeds, but the ship is damaged and sets down on a
   lake due to their unfamiliarity with the controls. They are captured by
   human Wankhmen, who handle all communication between their Wankh
   masters and the rest of Tschai's inhabitants.

   About to be executed out of hand, the would-be thieves are reprieved
   when a high Wankh leader, who had been aboard the stolen ship, decides
   to investigate further. Reith is able to tell it what he has surmised.
   The Wankhmen have been deliberately misleading the Wankh; the Dirdir
   have not been a threat to them for centuries, but have been made to
   appear so in order to safeguard the Wankhmen's comfortable status quo.
   Furthermore, they destroyed Reith's ship for the same reason. As a
   result of these revelations, the Wankhmen are expelled from the Wankh
   cities. Reith and his party creep away unnoticed.
