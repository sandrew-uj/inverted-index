   Bud Corliss is a young man with a ruthless drive to rise above his
   working-class origins to a life of wealth and importance. He serves in
   the Pacific in World War II, and upon his honorable discharge in 1947
   he learns that his father was killed in an automobile accident while he
   was overseas.

   The most pivotal moment in his life occurs during the war, when he
   first wounds, then kills, a Japanese sniper, who is so terrified that
   he wets his pants and begs for mercy. Corliss is elated by the total
   power he holds over the soldier; at the same time, he is disgusted by
   the man's display of abject terror.

   Upon returning to the U.S., he enrolls in college and meets Dorothy
   Kingship, the daughter of a wealthy copper tycoon. Seeing an
   opportunity to attain the riches he has always craved, he becomes
   Dorothy's lover. When she tells him she is pregnant, however, he
   panics; he is sure that her stern, conservative father will disinherit
   her. Resolving to get rid of Dorothy, he tricks her into writing a
   letter that, to an unknowing observer, would look like a suicide note,
   and then throws her from the roof of a tall building. He runs no risk
   of getting caught, having urged Dorothy to keep their relationship a
   secret from her family and friends. He continues to live with his
   mother, who dotes on him and has no clue as to what he has done.

   Corliss lies low for a few months until the press coverage of Dorothy's
   death has subsided. Then he pursues Dorothy's sister, Ellen. The
   romance is going according to plan until Ellen begins to probe into
   Dorothy's death, convinced her sister did not kill herself. Eventually,
   Ellen uncovers the truth about Corliss and confronts him. Corliss
   nonchalantly confesses to the crime and kills Ellen as well.

   Unfazed by this setback, Corliss courts the last remaining Kingship
   daughter, Marion. This affair is the most successful; Corliss sweeps
   her off her feet and charms her father, and soon he and Marion are
   engaged.

   Local college DJ Gordon Gant, who met Ellen during her investigation of
   Dorothy's death, begins investigating the case, and is immediately
   suspicious of Corliss. He breaks into Corliss' childhood home and
   steals a written plan for meeting and seducing Marion to get her
   family's money. Days before the wedding, he shows up at the Kingship
   family home and presents Marion and her father with the evidence of
   Corliss' deception.

   On a trip to one of the Kingship family's copper manufacturing plants,
   Marion, her father and Gant all corner Corliss while he is standing
   over a vat of molten copper and threaten to expose him. Corliss
   frantically pleads his innocence, but his accusers are unmoved.
   Realizing his luck has finally run out, Bud Corliss panics and wets his
   pants - just as the Japanese soldier, his symbol of pathetic cowardice,
   had done. Delirious with fear and shame, Bud Corliss stumbles and falls
   to his death into the vat below.
