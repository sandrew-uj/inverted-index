   In a two-part tale, the reader embarks on a journey of humor, sorrow,
   and tenderness, within a story of cultures colliding, highlighting a
   young orphaned elf, the last on earth, named Yorsh, full name
   Yorshkrunsquarklejolnerstrink. His village has been destroyed by
   torrential rain, and he finds himself living in a world plagued by
   intolerance, shrouded in darkness, hungry, cold, and wet. Upon meeting
   and being reluctantly befriended by a hunter named Monser and Sajra, a
   woman, Yorsh learns of a prophecy and of his importance in saving the
   world of this Dark Age. To fulfill the prophecy and bring the world
   into an age where the sun will shine again, he must first find another
   bereaved creature: the last dragon. Upon discovering the dragon, Yorsh
   decides to stay and keep him company.^[2]

   The second part of the story takes place thirteen years later; the
   dragon dies leaving him with an egg. Yorsh takes upon the task of
   raising the young dragon. Yorsh, coming to miss deeply his companions
   the hunter and the woman, journeys back to the old village to find
   their daughter Robi, and learns of the hanging they endured for
   protecting him. Saddened, Yorsh decides he will protect the young
   orphaned Robi. Deciding to leave, the elf, young dragon, and Robi move
   to a new country, forming a new constitution to govern the population
   of their new world, "No one can hit anybody... And you can't hang
   people, either."
