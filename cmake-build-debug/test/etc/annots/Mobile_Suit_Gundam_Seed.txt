   The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in the "Cosmic Era"
   in which humankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans,
   known as "Naturals", and the genetically altered super-humans known as
   "Coordinators". The primary conflict of the story plot derives from
   jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities of Coordinators, leading to
   hate crimes, and eventually the emigration of almost all Coordinators
   who flee into space to live idyllic lives on giant orbital space
   colonies called PLANTS of their own design. War eventually breaks out
   between Earth and the PLANTS. The Earth is divided between two major
   factions, the Earth Forces formed from most of the natural born human
   nations, primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic Federation, and a
   natural human supremacist group known as Blue Cosmos with its slogan,
   "For the preservation of our blue and pure world". The Earth Forces are
   not a unified alliance, and infighting and mistrust exist between their
   various nation states. The second major Earth nation is the Orb Union,
   a staunchly politically neutral and isolationist nation located on
   small Pacific Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still
   contains Coordinator citizens.

   Two major events precede the story, known as the Bloody Valentine
   tragedy that initiated war between the PLANTS and the Earth Forces when
   one of the PLANT space stations, Junius-7, is destroyed by a nuclear
   bomb. The second event is the counterattack by the PLANTS that buries
   Neutron Jammers deep into Earth's crust that halts all nuclear
   reactions and long range radar and radio, causing most areas of earth
   to go without electricity or communication, and requiring mobile suits
   to rely on rechargeable batteries.

   The PLANTS are a technological power house, developing many new
   technologies that give them equal power to Earth despite their very
   small population. It is the invention of the Mobile Suits that give
   their military the edge in the beginning of the war.

   The story begins in the neutral Orb Union owned space colony
   Heliopolis, where five advanced mobile suits for the Earth Forces war
   effort are developed in secret in exchange of sharing of their
   technical data with the neutral Orb Union military. Additionally,
   Heliopolis constructs a unique carrier battleship, the Archangel, to
   base the five mobile suits from for the Earth Forces. The colony is
   attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of the PLANTS, with the objective
   of stealing the new units. During the incursion an Orb Union student
   and Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends in danger,
   pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the
   colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis
   disintegrates, the survivors board the Archangel, and begin their
   journey to the Alliance base in Alaska. During the journey to
   Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT
   but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun
   Zala, during one of their battles in which he also is nearly
   killed. Kira survives the attack and is taken by a blind priest to
   one of the PLANT space colonies, home to the Coordinators to recover.
   The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full-scale attack
   on the base overpowering their enemies.

   Kira goes to Alaska with the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, a highly advanced,
   nuclear powered, and Neutron Jammer proof ZAFT mobile suit stolen by
   the PLANT pop star Coordinator Lacus Clyne, daughter of PLANT Supreme
   Council Chairman Siegel Clyne. Using the Freedom, Kira ends the battle
   between the two armies, but the Alaska base is subsequently destroyed.
   The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb Union. The
   Archangel and a new ship, the Orb Union ship Kusanagi leave Earth for
   space where they then join Lacus Clyne's rebel faction and their stolen
   ZAFT battleship, the Eternal (meant to carry the Freedom and Justice
   mobile suits) to form the Three Ships Alliance with the common goal of
   ending the war between the Naturals and Coordinators. In the midst of
   the conflict, Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him
   under orders to recover the Freedom Gundam, and is given an equally
   powerful prototype, the ZGMF-X09A Justice. However, after learning
   of Patrick Zala's, Athrun's father and the radical militant faction
   leader of the PLANT Supreme Council, plan to commit genocide, Athrun
   deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance. In a final battle,
   the Earth Forces deploys nuclear weapons equipped with Neutron Jammer
   Canceler technology copied from stolen data on the Freedom and Justice
   Gundam's power systems. The Earth Forces intend to destroy the PLANT
   space colonies but are stopped by ZAFT's GENESIS, a super weapon
   microwave laser designed to commit genocide on the Naturals. The Three
   Ship Alliance intervenes to defeat the GENESIS weapon ending the
   battle. The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is signed.
