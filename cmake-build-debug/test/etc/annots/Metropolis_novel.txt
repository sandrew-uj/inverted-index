   The story is set in 2026 in a technologically-advanced city, which is
   sustained by the existence of an exploited class of labourers who live
   underground, far away from the gleaming surface world. Freder, the son
   of Joh Fredersen, one of the city's founders, falls in love with Maria,
   a girl from the underground. The two classes begin to clash for lack of
   a unifying force.
