   The eight survivors of the Nine Magicians of Zaar, whose colleague
   Adamancus was killed in the previous volume, cloak their Rmoahal
   henchmen in invisibility, enabling them to capture their nemesis
   Thongor. The Rmoahal take him to their castle to turn him over to their
   masters. He escapes into its catacombs where he destroys an ancient
   worm god, but is retaken by the Zaarians. Mardanax of Zaar then flies
   him on a pterodactyl to the city of magicians.

   Thongor's ally, the exiled Rmoahal prince Shangoth, infiltrates the
   city to rescue him. The two manage to turn the tables on the magicians,
   reflecting their own spells against them. Only Mardanax escapes the
   slaughter.

   The book includes a frontispiece map by the author of part of Lemuria.
