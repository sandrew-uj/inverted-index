   In The Dreamstone Arafel, a Daoine Sidhe helps Ciaran, a halfling (half
   human, half elf) save Caer Wiell near to Ealdwood forest, the last
   remaining bastion of Faery on Earth. The Tree of Swords and Jewels
   continues the story ten years later, when Ciaran has married Branwyn
   and become Lord of Caer Wiell. All of Caer Wiell are aware of Ciaran's
   connections to the Sidhe, whom they fear. One day Arafel visits Ciaran
   and returns elf prince Liosliath's dreamstone to him, saying that she
   needs his help: dark forces have awakened again and have overrun part
   of Eald (Faery). Ciaran tells her that peace in the region is fragile:
   King Laochailan does not trust him, and Ciaran's brother Donnchadh of
   Caer Donn fears him and his elf heritage.

   Arafel begins searching for those responsible for the shrinking of
   Eald, and discovers Duilliath, a drow (dark elf) living in Dun Gol, the
   site of an ancient elf battle. Dun Gol is close to Caer Donn, and
   Duilliath has begun influencing Donnchadh's thoughts and actions. Just
   as Arafel controls Caer Wiell, Duilliath controls Caer Donn. Arafel
   tries to coax him back to sleep again, but a duel erupts and she is
   injured, forcing her to retreat to Eald. Trees in Eald are dying and
   Arafel tries unsuccessfully to call on the departed elves for help.

   When Ciaran learns that King Laochailan is ill, he tries to contact his
   brother, and when that fails he enters Eald to ask for Arafel's help,
   but finds Duilliath there. While trying to flee Eald, Ciaran is
   ambushed by An Beag bandits, who mortally wound him--only Liosliath's
   stone about his neck keeps him alive. Duilliath, with plans to expand
   his armies and influence, instructs Donnchadh to go to Dun na h-Eoin,
   kill Laochailan and install himself as king. Ciaran manages to return
   to Caer Wiell, where he lies on his deathbed. Upon hearing that
   Donnchadh is the new king, Ciaran makes one last attempt to contact
   Arafel and enters Eald.

   One of Arafel's aides instructs Branwyn to evacuate Caer Wiell, and he
   takes her people to the safety of Beorc's Steading, a sanctuary hidden
   in a valley. In Eald, Ciaran finds his elf horse waiting for him, but
   they are pursued by dark elves and he flees to the sea. Dying, and with
   nowhere else to go, Ciaran draws on the power of his stone and is given
   Camhanach, a silver horn. His last act is to blow three times into the
   horn, which summons the Daoine Sidhe. But this act also releases
   Nathair Sgiathach, an ancient dragon that the Sidhe had bound to
   Cinniuint, the Tree of Swords and Jewels.

   Nathair Sgiathach confronts a weakened Arafel and threatens to enslave
   her. Liosliath returns, takes over Ciaran's body, and kills Donnchadh,
   now occupied by Duilliath. Liosliath and several other elves rush to
   Arafel's assistance in Ealdwood and defeat the dragon. Liosliath and
   Arafel later visit Branwyn at the Steading and tell her that she is
   free to build her own Caer Wiell as this land has left mortal Earth. It
   is safe from the dark things that have burrowed again, and the drow
   that has returned to sleep at Dun Gol.
