   US Army Private Bronwyn Hyatt returns home after being wounded during
   the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She is Tufa and lives in a remote
   Appalachian valley in East Tennessee with her extended family.
   Dark-haired, dark-skinned and enigmatic, the Tufa are said to be
   descendants of Irish fairies and have lived in the area long before the
   first European settlers arrived. Music is an essential part of Tufa
   culture and songs are passed down from mother to daughter. Music
   empowers the Tufa with magical abilities, including healing, flying and
   the ability to communicate with haints.

   Bronwyn quickly recovers from her injuries, but has disturbing visits
   by a haint. She also discovers that her mother, Chloe is plagued by
   death omens. Dwayne Gitterman, Bronwyn's former abusive boyfriend,
   begins stalking and harassing her again. Bronwyn joined the army to
   escape Dwayne. The Tufa have split into two factions, Bronwyn's group,
   led by Mandalay Harris of the First Daughters, and Dwayne's group led
   by Rockhouse Hicks. The First Daughters have preserved Tufa culture and
   can practise magic, while Hicks' group have forsaken their roots and
   lost their magical abilities.

   The Tufa's contact with the outside world has increased over the years,
   and intermarrying has taken place. Don Swayback's great-grandmother was
   Tufa, and he has some Tufa blood in him. He is a reporter and is tasked
   with interviewing Bronwyn, but when he makes contact with the Tufa, he
   discovers that he more Tufa than he realized. Craig Chess is a
   Methodist preacher. He has no Tufa blood, but becomes fascinated with
   the mysterious community and forms a relationship with Bronwyn.
