   Dr. Ethan Urquhart, Chief of Biology at the Sevarin District
   Reproduction Centre on Athos, is upset to find that his long-awaited
   shipment of ovarian tissue cultures from off-planet consists of an
   unusable mixture of dead and animal tissues. An exclusively
   male-populated planetary colony, continuing reproduction on Athos
   relies on uterine replicator technology, but the centuries-old cultures
   introduced by the original colonists have recently begun deteriorating
   into senescence. With their entire shipment purchased from the planet
   Jackson's Whole inexplicably consisting of genetic trash, the
   Population Council of Athos sends a reluctant Ethan offworld in search
   of a fresh batch of tissue cultures and (if possible) a refund from the
   original supplier, House Bharaputra. This is a very daring assignment
   as it means contact with women, who Athosians are taught are demonic
   and terrifying.

   Ethan arrives at the interstellar hub of Kline Station and immediately
   encounters his first woman, Commander Elli Quinn, a rather unorthodox
   intelligence officer with the Dendarii Free Mercenary Fleet (and a
   subordinate of Admiral Naismith's). Though she is pleasant and even
   helpful, Ethan is wary of her. He is soon abducted and interrogated by
   military agents from Cetaganda who are seeking a fugitive named
   Terrence Cee as well as their own lost tissue cultures. They refuse to
   believe that Ethan is not an opposing intelligence operative. Elli
   rescues Ethan from certain execution. They become reluctant allies as
   Elli explains that she has actually been hired by House Bharaputra to
   track the Cetagandans, and for her own reasons determine what their
   interest is in the tissue cultures and how it relates to a secret
   Cetagandan research project.

   Terrence approaches Ethan with a request for asylum, revealing himself
   to be the last survivor of a Cetagandan genetic project to create
   telepaths. Although his telepathy is reliable, it has a small range and
   can only be triggered for a short amount of time by ingesting large
   doses of the amino acid tyramine. Terrance's female counterpart,
   Janine, had been killed in their escape, but he managed to preserve her
   body and transport it to Jackson's Whole, where he paid House
   Bharaputra to splice her genes into the ovarian cultures that were
   intended for Athos. Terrence had planned to also emigrate to Athos with
   the cultures, but had been delayed on his way to Kline Station, and is
   now horrified to learn that the cultures were stolen and replaced by
   the useless material that ultimately arrived on Athos.

   The Cetagandans had tracked Terrence to Jackson's Whole; arriving after
   his departure, they had killed the Bharaputra researchers who had
   worked with him and destroyed their records. They then traced the
   tissue shipment to Kline Station, knowing Terrence would eventually
   come for it, though they have no knowledge of what happened to the
   original cultures and are desperate to reclaim them. Elli and Ethan
   manage to have the Cetagandans seized by Kline Station security, just
   as they discover that a minor official at the station had, for petty
   personal reasons, "thrown out" the Bharaputran tissue cultures that
   contained Janine's genes and replaced them with the useless biological
   material. Elli attempts to recruit Terrence for the Dendarii; he
   refuses, but gives Elli a small genetic sample. Meanwhile, Ethan asks
   Elli for (and receives) one of her ovaries to create a new tissue
   culture. After her departure, the original Bharaputran shipment
   unexpectedly turns up intact and usable, not destroyed. Ethan buys a
   new set of ovarian cultures from Beta Colony anyway as a cover, uses
   their packaging to relabel the cultures with Janine's genes, and
   returns with them and Terrence to Athos.
