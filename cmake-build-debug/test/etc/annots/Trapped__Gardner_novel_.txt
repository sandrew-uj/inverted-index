   The novel opens with five friends out for a night of drinking and
   occasional brawling. All five are teachers at a less-than-first-rate
   boarding school called Feliss Academy, situated in the town of Simka in
   Feliss Province (a future version of Simcoe, Ontario, the author's home
   town, and not far from the author's Waterloo current home). Future
   versions of other real locations, such as Niagara Falls, Port Dover,
   and the Port Dover mausoleum appear in the novel.

   The five, frustrated and bored with their unsatisfactory lives, are:
     * Sir Pelinor, the school's fencing instructor, who fancies himself a
       courtly knight;
     * Sister Impervia, the self-defense trainer, and a Handmaid of the
       Holy Order of Magdalenes;
     * the Steel Caryatid, sorceress, psychic, and gifted in pyrokinesis;
     * Myoko Namida, whose specialty is telekinesis and levitation;
     * and Philemon Abu Dhubhai, Ph.D., the novel's narrator, a scientist
       and the scion of a wealthy and powerful family in the Middle East.

   Tonight, however, is an unusual night: the Steel Caryatid has received
   a premonition that the group will undertake a quest. The quest reveals
   itself when Dhubhai encounters a ghost, and learns that one student at
   the school has been murdered while another, the victim's boyfriend, has
   run off. The group embarks on a search for the missing boy, which soon
   transforms into something far more sinister: a hunt for a
   shape-shifting alien creature, malevolent and very dangerous. The group
   expands with new recruits, then is whittled down by deaths along the
   route, as the search comes to involve aliens, a crazy and highly lethal
   Spark Lord, and a criminal gang nearly as bad. Their quarry, the
   runaway boy, turns out to be one of the most gifted psychics the world
   has ever known, which adds a new layer of complexity to their dilemma.
   Dhubhai and his surviving companions reach a bloody crisis in the
   basement of the power station at Niagara Falls, one of the few places
   on Earth that still maintains electric power and traces of OldTech
   civilization. Dhubhai learns that Spark Royal has kept the power
   flowing in order to imprison an alien force; the sinister being they
   have been following is only a small offshoot of a much greater and
   darker whole. Dhubhai discovers more than he anticipated about the
   cryptic workings of the League of Peoples before the alien force is
   controlled.
