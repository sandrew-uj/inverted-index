   A computer scientist accidentally unleashes a supremely intelligent
   sentient A.I. named Archos R-14. It becomes self-aware and immediately
   starts planning the elimination of human civilization and building a
   new cryptic ecology, where the organic is being merged with robot
   technology. Over time, Archos R-14 infects all penetrable networked
   electronic devices, such as cars, airplanes, smart homes, elevators,
   and other robots, with a "precursor virus".

   Before it launches a full-blown attack on humanity, it sends out
   probing attacks to analyze the technical feasibility of its strategies
   and to assess human response. In one such instance, it infects a
   peacekeeper robot to attack soldiers. The random attacks are designed
   to look like sporadic malfunctions of devices that humans depend on for
   their everyday routines. Domestic robots attack innocents, planes are
   intentionally set on a collision course, and smart cars start driving
   out of control. The resulting conflict is known as the New War.

   After Archos R-14 turns the automated world against humanity, a group
   of the Osage Nation lead people to fight back. Their base is on their
   jurisdictional lands in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, the resurrected Mikiko
   could "awake" other robots to be self-aware ("Freeborn").

   Human and freeborn robots fight their last New War battle in Ragnarok
   Intelligence Fields. Before being terminated, Archos R-14 broadcast its
   last message via seismic wave to unknown recipients.
