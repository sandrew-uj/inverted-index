   The story follows Arkady Renko, a chief investigator for the Moscow
   militsiya, who is assigned to a case involving three corpses found in
   Gorky Park, an amusement park in Moscow. The victims - two men and a
   woman - were shot, and have had their faces and fingertips cut off by
   the murderer to prevent identification.

   Ice skates found on the woman's body lead Arkady to Irina Asanova, a
   wardrobe girl at a movie studio, who claims that she reported them
   stolen, and has no idea how they ended up with the victims. However,
   Arkady tentatively identifies the three bodies as known associates of
   Irina: her friend Valerya Davidova, Valerya's boyfriend Kostia Borodin,
   and an American expatriate student named James Kirwill. Arkady gives
   the woman's skull to Professor Andreev, an anthropologist at Moscow
   University, who specializes in reconstructing whole faces from bone
   structure.

   At a bathhouse, Arkady's superior, Chief Prosecutor Iamskoy, introduces
   Arkady to an American fur millionaire, John Osborne, who regularly
   visits Russia. When Arkady begins to suspect a connection between
   Osborne and the murders, he is warned by his associate, Mendel, a
   junior official in the Soviet Trade Ministry, that Osborne is an
   informant for the KGB, and thus regarded as a "friend" by all of
   Arkady's superiors.

   Arkady's problems escalate when his partner is shot to death
   investigating Davidova's apartment, and Kirwill's elder brother
   William, a detective with the New York City Police Department who
   speaks fluent Russian, arrives in Moscow intending to find and kill his
   brother's murderer. Arkady tries to discover as much as he can from
   Kirwill to confirm the corpse's identity, without admitting that he
   suspects Osborne.

   When Irina is attacked on the Moscow underground, Arkady hides her in
   his own apartment, vacant since his wife, Zoya, left him for one of her
   colleagues at the school where she teaches.

   Arkady reluctantly pays a visit to his father, retired Red Army General
   Renko, a.k.a. "Stalin's Favorite General", a.k.a. "The Butcher of
   Ukraine". The elder Renko remembers that Osborne was an O.S.S. officer
   attached to the Red Army during the Nazi invasion, tasked with
   interrogating three captured S.S. officers. Thanks to his charm and
   fluent German, Osborne got the information he needed from the officers
   over a friendly picnic in the countryside, then shot all three of them
   dead - almost exactly the manner in which the three bodies in Gorky
   Park were killed.

   Arkady and Irina become lovers after admitting their mutual attraction,
   but Arkady is convinced that she knows about Osborne's connection with
   the three victims, except she believes that Osborne has helped Valerya
   and Kostia to defect to America, with their friend Kirwill, a radical
   anti-Soviet, hoping to claim a publicity victory for having facilitated
   their escape. To convince Irina that Valerya is dead, Arkady sets up a
   situation in which he is going to show her Professor Andreev's
   reconstruction, even though by this point the reconstruction has been
   destroyed by Renko's higher-ups. The ruse works, and she admits that
   her friend is dead rather than have to look at the reconstructed head.

   Despite being born into the nomenklatura himself, Arkady exposes
   corruption and dishonesty on the part of influential and well-protected
   members of the elite, regardless of the consequences. This rebounds on
   him when his own superior, Iamskoy, and his best friend, a lawyer named
   Misha, are both revealed to be working with Osborne. Arkady flees a
   meeting with Misha before a gang of killers arrive, but is too late to
   prevent Iamskoy from appropriating the reconstructed head and
   destroying it. Arkady confronts Osborne at gunpoint as he is about to
   leave the country, but Osborne informs him that Iamskoy has already
   kidnapped Irina, and if Arkady lets Osborne go and rushes to the
   university campus, he might be just in time to save her. Arkady does
   so, killing Iamskoy and Osborne's chief henchman, but suffering a near
   fatal stomach wound.

   He recuperates in the custody of the State, being regularly
   interrogated by the KGB and watched over by his old antagonist, KGB
   Major Pribluda. In spite of his weakened state, Arkady laughs when he
   realizes from his interrogators' questions that Iamskoy was himself a
   high-ranking KGB officer, planted as a spy in the militsiya, and his
   superiors were badly embarrassed to find that he betrayed them to help
   Osborne.

   Months later, Arkady is brought before a KGB General who confirms what
   Arkady already suspected: that Kostia Borodin (an expert hunter) and
   Valerya helped Osborne to trap and smuggle live sables - the only
   high-quality fur-bearing animal on which the Soviet Union enjoys a
   monopoly - out of Russia. They believed Osborne would help them defect
   in exchange, but instead he killed them. Now, after several months of
   negotiations, Osborne has agreed to return the sables in exchange for
   Arkady being released and brought to America.

   Arkady's brief trip to New York City reunites him with Osborne, Irina,
   and Kirwill in succession. Arkady is outraged when Osborne tells him
   that he and Irina are lovers, but Irina swears that she only slept with
   Osborne twice - once to convince him to help her defect, and once more
   to convince him to bring Arkady to America.

   FBI agents escort Arkady and Irina to Osborne's ranch on Staten Island
   where the exchange is supposed to take place. During the trip Arkady
   realizes that, to avoid a diplomatic incident, the FBI agents plan to
   let Osborne kill him and Irina before allowing KGB agents, who are
   tailing them, to kill Osborne. When they arrive at the ranch the group
   finds Kirwill, shot and disemboweled. He finally identified Osborne as
   his brother's killer, but was overcome by Osborne's attack dogs when he
   came to confront him.

   Osborne appears, armed with a hunting rifle, and Arkady convinces him
   that the FBI is planning a betrayal. Osborne shoots two of the FBI
   agents as two KGB agents arrive, and the KGB and FBI agents are killed
   in the chaotic firefight that ensues. Osborne finally corners and
   wounds Arkady in the sable pens. Arkady gains the upper hand by
   releasing several of the sables, causing Osborne to rush recklessly
   into the pen where Arkady is able to shoot and kill him. Irina arrives
   and says that she wants to stay in America, but Arkady, finding America
   to be as corrupt as the Soviet Union, chooses to return to the latter;
   he also knows that if he does return home, the Soviet authorities will
   be less inclined to demand Irina's return.

   Realizing that the only way to reduce his superiors' ire is to kill all
   the illicit sables, Arkady picks up Osborne's hunting rifle, but
   instead he decides to break open their cages and release them into the
   forest.
