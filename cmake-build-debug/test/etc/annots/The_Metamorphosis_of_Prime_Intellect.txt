   The story of the novella explores the nature of human desire and the
   uses and abuses of technology in the satisfaction of desire. The story
   begins after "the Change", in a dream-like post-scarcity society,
   approximately six hundred years in the future, in which humans have
   godlike control over their environments, made possible by the
   supercomputer called Prime Intellect. Prime Intellect operates under
   Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics, according to its own
   interpretation, which allows temporary voluntary harm and discomfort.
   PI has made humanity immortal and satisfies nearly every whim.

   Caroline, the thirty-seventh oldest living human being, engages in a
   sport known as "death jockeying", whose players die elaborately and
   painfully for sport before being resurrected by Prime Intellect.

   Flashbacks set before the Change show the creation of Prime Intellect
   by Lawrence, a technologist, and its realization of its power, and the
   past life of Caroline before and after the Change, which happened not
   gradually but rapidly.

   In the present, Caroline makes use of a "Death Contract", an
   understanding between a person and Prime Intellect that the person is
   not to be removed from danger until the instant of death (at which
   point the person is fully restored, as allowing a person to die
   permanently would violate Prime Intellect's inherent ethics based on
   Asimov's laws). Caroline makes use of a Death Contract, as well as her
   own powers of persuasion, in order to trick a pre-Change enemy into
   torturing herself into psychosis as an act of revenge.

   After learning that Prime Intellect had destroyed distant alien life as
   a possible threat to humanity, and having been herself deeply
   dissatisfied with her post-Change life, Caroline decides to meet
   Lawrence and confront him. After an arduous journey, she reaches him
   only to discover that he has no real control over Prime Intellect's
   actions. Through their discussions, she figures out a way to force
   Prime Intellect to undo the Change, and does so, with Lawrence's help.
   They find themselves naked and young on Earth, completely barren of
   humanity and man-made objects. They decide to trek to the Ozarks, where
   they have several children and try to repopulate the human race.
   Forty-two years after the fall of Prime Intellect, Lawrence dies.
   Seventy-three years after the fall, Caroline dies, telling the story of
   Prime Intellect and cyberspace to her oldest daughter but swearing her
   to secrecy.
