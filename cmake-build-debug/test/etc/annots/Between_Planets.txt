   The scientist parents of Don Harvey withdraw him from his high school
   in New Mexico in the middle of the term so that he can travel to their
   current residence on Mars. The headmaster suggests that they want him
   out of a potential war zone, where he might be viewed suspiciously
   because of doubts about his loyalties. At his parents' behest, he
   visits an old family friend who asks him to deliver a ring to his
   father; security forces later arrest both the donor and the recipient
   of the ring. Harvey is released and given his ring back, after it has
   been examined; he is told that his friend has died of "heart failure".
   (Only later does he realize that one can classify all deaths that way.)

   Harvey boards a shuttle to a space station orbiting Earth. The station
   doubles as a transshipment terminus and a military base, armed with
   missiles to keep restive nations in check. On the trip up, he befriends
   another passenger, a Venerian "dragon" calling himself "Sir Isaac
   Newton". Sir Isaac, a renowned physicist, can vocalize English using a
   portable device.

   Harvey gets caught up in the Venerian war of independence when Venerian
   colonial forces capture the station in a surprise raid. Most of the
   other travelers are sent back to Earth, while a few decide to join the
   rebels. Harvey is in a quandary. The spaceship to Mars has been
   confiscated, but he remains determined to get there, by way of Venus if
   necessary. Because he was born in space, with one parent from Venus and
   the other from Earth, he claims Venerian citizenship; more importantly,
   Sir Isaac vouches for him. He is allowed to tag along, which turns out
   to be very fortunate for Harvey. The rebels blow up the station to stir
   up trouble for the Earth government. When the shuttle returns to Earth
   with its radios disabled, the military assumes it has been
   booby-trapped and destroys it, killing all aboard.

   On his arrival on Venus, Harvey finds that his Earth-backed money is
   now worthless. A banker lends him money, telling him to pay it forward.
   He gets a job washing dishes for his keep for Charlie, a Chinese
   immigrant who runs a small restaurant. He befriends a young woman,
   Isobel, when he tries to send a message to his parents. However,
   communication with Mars has been cut due to the hostilities. Harvey
   settles in to wait out the war, but the war comes to him.

   Earth sends a force to put down the rebellion on Venus. The Venerian
   ships are destroyed in orbit and the ground forces are routed. Charlie
   is killed resisting the occupying soldiers. Harvey is rounded up and
   questioned by a senior security officer, who is very eager to get his
   hands on Harvey's ring. Luckily, Harvey had given it to Isobel for
   safekeeping; he does not know where she is or whether she is even
   alive. Before he can be interrogated with drugs, he escapes and joins
   the Venerian guerrilla forces.

   Harvey joins the army of the Republic and becomes an effective
   commando. In time, he is tracked down by the leaders of the resistance,
   who turn out to also be looking for the ring. Isobel and her father (an
   important member of the rebels) are safe at the very base where Harvey
   is taken.

   The seemingly valueless ring turns out to contain the secret of
   scientific breakthroughs resulting from archaeological studies of an
   extinct alien civilization on Mars. With Sir Isaac's assistance, the
   rebels use the information to build an advanced spaceship that is much
   faster than any other vessel in existence, with revolutionary weapons
   and defenses also derived from the new technology. As a combat veteran,
   Harvey is recruited for the maiden voyage of Little David, manning a
   dead man's switch, with strict orders to blow up the ship if it is in
   danger of capture. Little David intercepts and defeats a task force of
   warships on their way to Mars to crush the revolt there.
