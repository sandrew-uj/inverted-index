   Zoo City is set in an alternate version of the South African city of
   Johannesburg, in which people who have committed a crime are magically
   attached to an animal familiar - those who receive such punishment are
   said to be "animalled". The novel's chief protagonist, Zinzi December,
   is a former journalist and recovering drug addict who was "animalled"
   to a sloth after getting her brother killed. She lives in the
   Johannesburg suburb of Hillbrow, which is nicknamed "Zoo City" in the
   novel for its large population of animalled people, refugees and the
   dispossessed.^[3] Zinzi is attempting to repay the financial debt she
   owes her drug dealer by charging people for her special skill of
   finding lost objects, as well as making use of her writing abilities by
   drafting 419 fraud emails. The book's plot focuses on Zinzi's attempts
   to find the missing female member of a brother-and-sister pop duo for a
   music producer, in return for the money she needs to fully repay her
   dealer.^[2]^[3]^[8]
