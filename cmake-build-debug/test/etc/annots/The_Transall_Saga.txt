   The story begins with Mark Harrison, a 13-year-old survival enthusiast,
   hiking through the mountainous Magruder Missile Range. All of a sudden,
   he gets bitten by a snake and falls into the blue light. He wakes up in
   a strange world that he believes is an alien world with many
   similarities to Earth. He uses his survival skills to live off the land
   and while exploring the forest, he discovers a camp made up of short,
   human-like creatures with webbed feet and dark, olive-colored skin.
   Soon he finds them too warlike to bear interacting with. He also hears
   a creature called the howling thing. A tribe which Mark refers to as
   the Arrow People allow him to live with them. He meets a girl named
   Leeta, whom he befriends. Soon after, he is enslaved by the Tsook, a
   metal-weapon wielding race of hominids. Over the next three months, he
   learns their language and develops feelings for Megan, the chief's
   daughter he loves her more than anything. Mark attempts to flee the
   village, but as he is trying to escape, he learns of an imminent
   invasion of the village. Mark returns to warn the tribe about an
   impending attack, and as a gift, Mark is granted freedom and official
   entry into their tribe.

   Mark then discovers that, despite his misconceptions earlier, this
   world is a ruined Earth, sometime in the future if we keep polluting
   it. Meagan's brother gives Mark a shard of a Coca-Cola bottle and the
   Merkon (leader of the world Transal) reveals the events between Mark's
   time and this future, also revealing that he too was sent there by the
   beam of light this means he is a human too. Sometime in the near
   future, a strange, highly contagious form of the Ebola virus wipes out
   most of the human race. Those remaining used nuclear armaments on each
   other, forcing civilization to start over. After severely wounding the
   Merkon in a sword fight, Mark asks Megan to marry him. However, the
   Merkon's son has sworn revenge and Mark flees the village to protect
   them he is even more ruthless that his father. He leads the Merkon's
   (his dads)army to the jungle, away from his new home. Once in the
   jungle, Mark systematically kills the army but forgets about a scouting
   party that attacks him. Mark hides behind a boulder for protection and
   suddenly the boulder is struck by lightning and sends off a charge
   which brings Mark into his normal time. Twenty years later he is a
   doctor finding a cure for the Ebola Virus o . o . o . o
