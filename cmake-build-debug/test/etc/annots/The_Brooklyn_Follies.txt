   59-year-old Nathan Glass returns to Park Slope in Brooklyn, New York
   after his wife has left him. He is recovering from lung cancer and is
   looking for "a quiet place to die". In Brooklyn he meets his nephew,
   Tom, whom he has not seen in several years. Tom has seemingly given up
   on life and has resigned himself to a string of meaningless jobs as he
   waits for his life to change. They develop a close friendship,
   entertaining each other in their misery, as they both try to avoid
   taking part in life.

   When Lucy, Tom's young niece who initially refuses to speak, comes into
   their lives there is suddenly a bridge between their past and their
   future that offers both Tom and Nathan some form of redemption.

   The Brooklyn Follies contains the classic elements of a Paul Auster
   novel. The main character is a lonely man, who has suffered an
   unfortunate reversal. The narrative is based on sudden and randomly
   happening events and coincidences. "It is a book about survival" as
   Paul Auster says.

   The novel was published in Danish in May 2005, under the name Brooklyn
   Daarskab. It was published in English in November 2005. The Traditional
   Chinese version appeared in October 2006 with the title slightly
   altered as Mr. Nathan in Brooklyn.
