   Radiant Dawn is divided into four parts, each of which begins with a
   prologue chapter that introduces the situation, followed by a series of
   chapters that is resolved with an "Endgame" chapter.

   Three years after the Mad King's War, detailed in Path of Radiance,
   Daein, the war's instigator and eventual loser, and the victorious
   nation Crimea are still in the process of rebuilding. Although Crimea
   is ruled by Queen Elincia, Daein lacks a proper successor and is
   instead ruled by the occupation forces of the Begnion Empire. The Daein
   people are oppressed by the corrupt Begnion senate and imperial
   soldiers. A group of Daein rebels named the Dawn Brigade, headed by
   Micaiah and Sothe, act as vigilantes to provide some measure of hope
   against the oppressors. After being driven from the capital, the Dawn
   Brigade flees into the northern desert. There they encounter the heron
   prince Rafiel and the wolf laguz queen Nailah, whose people have not
   been seen in Tellius for millennia. Soon after, the Dawn Brigade
   locates and allies with the late King Ashnard's orphan son Pelleas, his
   scheming and ruthless adviser Izuka, and the former general of Daein
   known as the Black Knight. The group launches a guerrilla war against
   the occupation army, liberating former soldiers of Daein from prison
   camps and gaining the loyalty of the people. Micaiah's efforts become
   legendary during these campaigns, with the people of Daein dubbing her
   the "Silver-Haired Maiden." Word of the plight of the Daein people
   eventually reaches Empress Sanaki of Begnion, who sends her trusted
   advisor Sephiran to Daein to reign in the occupation army. The senate
   disavows and scapegoats occupation leader General Jarod, who is
   overthrown and killed by the liberation army in an assault on the
   capital. Unbeknownst to them all, Izuka tricks Pelleas into signing a
   contract known as a blood pact with the head of the Begnion senate,
   Lekain, which will kill increasingly large numbers of Daein citizens
   when triggered.

   Word of Pelleas' ascension reaches Crimea, and Queen Elincia's
   recognition of Pelleas as Daein's rightful ruler outrages the Crimean
   nobility. Fear that Crimea's hated enemy is rebuilding creates
   discontent throughout all levels of Crimean society. A Crimean noble
   named Ludveck takes advantage of the tension to organize a rebellion in
   order to claim Crimea for himself. Alerted to Ludveck's plan, the
   Crimean Royal Knights attack and capture Ludveck's castle. However,
   this is a diversion, and Ludveck's troops lay siege Elincia's castle,
   but they are repelled and Ludveck is captured. He attempts to force
   Elincia to release him by holding her friend Lucia hostage, but she is
   rescued by Ike and the Greil Mercenaries. Before Ike leaves, Elincia
   reveals the Black Knight's return in Daein.

   When Ike returns to his headquarters, he is hired by the Laguz
   Alliance, consisting of the hawk nation of Pheonicis, the raven nation
   of Kilvas, and the beast nation of Gallia. Their representative,
   Ranulf, explains that Rafiel has revealed that the Begnion senate was
   responsible for assassinating the previous apostle of Begnion and
   framing the heron clans for it, resulting in their near annihilation.
   This has led to the Laguz Alliance declaring war on Begnion. Ike leads
   the Alliance into battle against the Begnion forces, commanded by the
   veteran general Zelgius. The situation quickly escalates, threatening
   to become a world war that will awaken the god of chaos Yune who will
   supposedly destroy the world. Begnion coerces Daein into joining the
   war on their side with the blood pact and uses another blood pact to
   force Kilvas to betray the Laguz Alliance. Pelleas asks Micaiah to kill
   him to free Daein from the blood pact, but even if she does, it simply
   results in the blood pact transferring to her. Nailah and Prince
   Kurthnaga of the dragon nation of Goldoa learn of Daein's plight and
   also side with them. Meanwhile, Begnion begins raiding Crimean villages
   for supplies, drawing Crimea into the conflict on the Laguz Alliance's
   side, and Empress Sanaki escapes the senate's clutches and joins the
   Alliance along with the faction of Begnion soldiers loyal to her. A
   massive battle ensues, and the chaos begins to awaken Yune; Micaiah is
   forced to prematurely awaken her with the galdr of release. Yune's
   awakening also awakens the goddess of order Ashera.

   As punishment for bringing the world into chaos, Ashera subsequently
   petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz
   half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival
   and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end.
   Guided by Yune, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn
   of Pheonicis lead three groups in an assault on the Tower of Guidance
   where Ashera lies. Their journey brings about several revelations about
   the world and the previous conflicts. Ranulf reveals that the Black
   Knight's true identity is Zelgius; if Pelleas survived, Izuka reveals
   that he was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place
   Daein further under Begnion's thumb; Yune reveals that the old claim
   that human-laguz half-breeds are a crime against the goddess and the
   subsequent persecution against them are based on a lie. In the Tower of
   Guidance, the group kills the corrupt Begnion senators and frees Daein
   and Kilvas from the blood pacts while Ike defeats Zelgius in a duel to
   the death. At the entrance to Ashera's chambers, the group encounters
   Sephiran, who reveals himself to be the ancient heron Lehran. Sephiran
   admits that the massacre of the heron clans destroyed his faith in
   humanity, and that he has since engineered both the Mad King's War and
   the Laguz-Begnion conflict in order to destroy the world. After
   defeating him, Yune empowers Ike with godlike power, and he defeats
   Ashera and restores peace to Tellius.

   In the aftermath, Micaiah learns that she is Sanaki's long-lost and
   presumed-dead older sister, but leaves to take the throne of Daein with
   the approval of Pelleas (if he survived) and the Daein citizenry. Ike
   departs the continent and is never seen again. Hundreds of years later,
   Yune and Ashera combine to again become the goddess Ashunera, creator
   of Tellius. On a second playthrough onward, Lehran can be spared and
   redeemed; in this case, he greets Ashunera and reveals that the
   continent is once again about to go to war, and Ashunera resolves to
   protect the people.
