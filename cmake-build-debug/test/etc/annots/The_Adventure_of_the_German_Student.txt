   In the introduction to Tales of a Traveller, Irving, under the guise of
   his fictional alter-ego Geoffrey Crayon, writes that "The following
   adventures were related to me by the same nervous gentleman" who he
   claims told him the story of "The Stout Gentleman", which was published
   in Irving's 1822 episodic novel Bracebridge Hall. In regards to
   "The Adventure of the German student", Irving writes that "the story,
   or rather than the latter part of it, is founded on an anecdote related
   to me as existing somewhere in the French". Irving would go on to
   reveal in journals that the story had been told to him by Thomas
   Moore.
