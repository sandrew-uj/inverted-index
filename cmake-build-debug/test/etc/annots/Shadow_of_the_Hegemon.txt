   In Shadow of the Hegemon, all of the Battle School graduates, except
   Ender, return to Earth in 2197 A.D., where Ender's brother Peter, using
   his online pseudonym Locke, arranges for Ender to be returned to Earth;
   but Valentine, under the pseudonym Demosthenes, uses Peter's violent
   past against him to keep Ender exiled. Shortly after their return, the
   members of the unit Ender commanded (called his Jeesh, an Arabic word
   meaning 'army'), with the exception of Bean, are seized as strategists
   in an upcoming struggle for world dominance, by Achilles de Flandres
   (ah-SHEEL), who subjects them to solitary confinement. Bean having
   imprisoned Achilles in the previous novel, Achilles attempts
   (unsuccessfully) to kill Bean. The Delphikis go into hiding, while Bean
   joins forces with Sister Carlotta. After he discovers an encoded
   message sent by Petra confirming that the Russians are Achilles'
   backers, he works to free her and the others, while helping Peter come
   to power.

   When Peter publishes under the 'Locke' pseudonym that Achilles is a
   murderer, the Battle School graduates are released, excepting Petra,
   whom Achilles brings to India. From there, he requests plans for an
   invasion of Burma and then Thailand, for which Indian Battle School
   graduates, including Sayagi and Virlomi, develop plans for brute-force
   attacks involving long supply lines. Petra arranges a different plan of
   stripping India's garrisons along the Indo-Pakistani border, which she
   expects will never happen, until a meeting with Pakistan's prime
   minister, in which Achilles encourages the two nations to make peace
   among themselves and declare war on other neighbors; secretly giving
   China the opportunity to annihilate the Indian army.

   Petra finds an ally in Virlomi, who reveals to Bean that Petra is a
   prisoner, and eventually escapes the military compound to bring rescue.
   Courtesy of Bean's and Sister Carlotta's assets, "Locke" is nominated
   publicly for the position of Hegemon, allowing Peter to unmask himself.
   Meanwhile, Bean enters the Thai military under the patronage of
   Suriyawong (Suri), a fellow Battle School graduate and (nominal) head
   of Thailand's planning division, and trains 200 Thai soldiers against
   India. When the Thai Commander-in-Chief betrays Suriyawong and Bean,
   Bean hides himself and Suri in the barracks of his troops, and sends
   word for rescue, while Thailand prepares for war. Sister Carlotta's
   airplane, en route to Bean's location, is destroyed by a Chinese SAM,
   and Bean receives an earlier-recorded message, in which she describes
   the relationship between Anton's Key and Bean's brilliance, but also
   informs him that his life expectancy will be drastically reduced as a
   result.

   Bean and Suriyawong use the troops Bean has trained to halt Indian
   supply lines. While striking a bridge, they meet Virlomi, who defects
   to their side. With the aid of Bean's soldiers and Locke's
   distinguished connections, they move on Hyderabad, where Bean rescues
   Petra. Furthermore, "Locke" publishes an essay detailing the Chinese
   betrayal just as it is happening, and on the basis of this prescience
   (and other miracles over the years) Peter Wiggin is elected Hegemon
   over the world.
