   Warbreaker tells the story of two Idrian princesses, Vivenna and Siri.
   Vivenna was contracted through a treaty written before she was born to
   marry the God King of rival nation Hallandren. However, King Dedelin
   sends his other daughter Siri to meet the treaty instead.

   Vivenna follows her to Hallandren in the hope of saving Siri from her
   fate. Upon arriving in Hallandren, Vivenna meets with Lemex, one of her
   father's spies in the city, but he has taken ill and dies shortly
   thereafter -- though not before bequeathing his large sum of
   BioChromatic Breath to her (which is considered heretical by the
   Idrians).

   Vivenna joins up with Denth and Tonk Fah, mercenaries that were under
   Lemex's employ, and together they begin making guerilla attacks against
   Hallandren's supply depots and convoys that will hopefully give the
   Idrians an advantage in the seemingly inevitable war.

   Siri, after spending many terrified nights waiting for the God King to
   procreate with her, finds that he is not actually the menacing,
   frightening God that she thought, but has actually had his tongue cut
   out by his priests, making him nothing more than a figurehead. Though
   he is intelligent, he possesses a childlike outlook because his
   education was withheld. Siri teaches the God King to communicate by
   writing, and over time they learn to care for each other and fall in
   love. However, Siri believes that the priests are secretly plotting to
   kill her and the God King if she produces an heir, and fears that
   Hallandren will soon launch a war against Idris. Siri finds a potential
   ally in the unorthodox god Lightsong, who is plagued by nightmares of
   war and is struggling to discover his purpose.

   Back in the city, Vivenna discovers that Denth and Tonk Fah are not
   working for her but against her, having been hired by an unknown third
   party to instigate the war with Idris, and she barely escapes their
   custody with her life. After hiding and living destitute in the Idrian
   slums of Hallandren for weeks, Vivenna is taken in by Vasher, a
   mysterious man who can use his BioChromatic Breath to Awaken objects,
   an art at which he is incredibly skilled. He wields a sword called
   Nightblood, a weapon created in a Biochromatic experiment and which
   possesses sentience. Together, Vivenna and Vasher work to undo the
   damage done by Denth and avert the war.

   Vivenna convinces Vasher to try and save her sister Siri from the God
   King's palace. However, Vasher is captured and tortured by Denth, who
   is revealed to have been working for the God King's Pahn Kahl servants,
   who are trying to incite war between the Idrians and Hallendren so that
   they can take the city for themselves.

   The Pahn Kahl servants capture Siri, kill many of the God King's
   priests, and throw the God King in the dungeon. Lightsong and many of
   the other gods are taken captive as well. The Pahn Kahl, having gained
   the Commands to control the city's undead Lifeless army, send them to
   attack the Idrians and start the war. However, Lightsong, imprisoned in
   the dungeon alongside the God King, sacrifices himself by giving the
   God King his BioChromatic Breath. This heals the king, giving him his
   tongue back and allowing him access to his godly cache of BioChromatic
   power. The God King uses his magic to save Siri from the Pahn Kahl
   servants just as she is about to be murdered. Meanwhile, Vivenna uses
   her own budding BioChromatic powers to break into the God King's palace
   and free Vasher, who kills Denth.

   Vivenna and Siri are reunited. However, even with the God King's near
   unlimited power, the Lifeless army cannot be stopped. Vasher then
   reveals that he is actually one of the Five Scholars -- ancient beings
   who originally discovered the Commands for using BioChromatic Breath --
   and bestows upon the God King the code to awaken the city's secret army
   of nearly indestructible D'denir Lifeless soldiers, which have been
   hidden in plain sight throughout the city as statues. These soldiers
   are sent to destroy the Lifeless army before it can reach Idris.

   While Siri and the God King begin a new rule and life together, Vivenna
   joins Vasher as he sets out on another quest to a distant land.
