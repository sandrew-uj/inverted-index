   While an undergraduate at Harvard, John Lang becomes friends with an
   Islandian fellow-student named Dorn, and decides to learn the Islandian
   language (of which there are very few speakers outside Islandia). Once
   he has graduated, his uncle, a prominent businessman, arranges his
   appointment as American consul to Islandia, based primarily on his
   ability to speak the language. Gradually John Lang learns that his
   tacit mission as American consul is to do whatever is necessary to
   increase American trade opportunities in Islandia. He does not begin
   this mission right away, preferring to get to know the country and the
   people first.

   John Lang meets and becomes infatuated with Dorn's sister, Dorna. They
   spend some time together alone, which John finds unnerving at first,
   since they are not chaperoned. When Dorna comes to understand John's
   feelings, she tells him that she does not love him in return in that
   way (though he wonders whether she means "cannot", or "will not"). She
   accepts the marriage proposal of the King instead, a handsome young man
   who has been courting her for some time.

   One of the culminations of the plot is the decision by the people of
   Islandia to reject the demands of the Great Powers for unrestricted
   trade and immigration, choosing instead to maintain their tradition of
   isolation. As this political struggle intensifies, John Lang
   sympathizes with the Islandians, to the great disappointment of many
   American businessmen who desire new lucrative trade opportunities,
   including John Lang's uncle.

   Near the end of the novel, John Lang is allowed to become a citizen of
   Islandia as a reward for heroism during an attack by a neighboring
   group. By this point he has fallen in love with an American friend with
   whom he has maintained steady correspondence. They decide to marry, and
   when she arrives in Islandia she, too, is granted citizenship.
