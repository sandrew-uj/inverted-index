   In 2008, terrorists developed a biological weapon called "Blizz". They
   used this weapon in local weather patterns in the United States. As it
   falls from the sky, it will instantly burn any living thing it touches.
   At her seventh birthday party, young Peggy (Emily Graham) watched as
   her friends were killed by Blizz, while she, her sister, and her mother
   took refuge inside the house, refusing to allow anyone else shelter
   with them.

   Ten years later, America has been ravaged by the effects of World War
   III. The death count continues to rise in this dark and bleak future
   and some states simply no longer exist. Peggy (Jessica Lowndes) is now
   almost 17, ignorant of the world outside her mother's diner. She has
   lost both her father and her sister, Anna, and now depends on her
   mother, Kate (Marilyn Norry). Business is slow, but Kate tells Peggy
   they're fine financially, as Peggy's father left them some money before
   his death in the war. One day, Peggy meets biker and drug addict Jak
   (Jonathan Tucker) and his two "friends", junkies Boxx (Ryan McDonald)
   and Celia (Lucie Guest). The three are into some shady dealings with a
   nightclub called The Doom Room, located in the grubby town of Muskeet.

   Kate warns Peggy that "everything the people of Muskeet do is a goddamn
   trick", and although she's afraid to disobey her mother, Peggy sneaks
   out with Jak in the middle of the night to the Doom Room with Boxx and
   Celia. Muskeet, as it appears, is completely ravaged and the home to
   ravagers, sociopathic bikers, and teenagers. The Doom Room is a heavy
   metal bar run by an MC (Robert Englund). As Peggy and Celia watch the
   band Decree perform, Boxx and Jak go behind the stage to perform a
   business deal with the MC. They provide him packets of blood. The MC
   promises that he will pay them if their product is good enough for the
   next "performance". If not, he'll make them eat it.

   At that point, Peggy witnesses what the performance is. The MC has
   collected the bodies of overdosed teens, called LUPs (Living Undead
   Phenomenon, or "loopies") injecting them with a drug that causes their
   hearts to beat twice as fast as normal resulting in convulsions and
   seizures. This drug was first discovered in the battlegrounds of the
   war, so the dead soldiers could get up and keep fighting. They are then
   pumped with blood and forced to dance, and those who can't move are
   shocked with electric prods. Peggy watches in horror as the MC brings
   out her own sister, Anna (Melena Ronnis).

   When Anna falls off the stage, Peggy and Jak take her away from the
   Doom Room, to be followed by the MC and one of his goons. Peggy and Jak
   meet up with Kate, who has tracked them to Muskeet. The MC sheds some
   light on how he came to "own" Anna. When she was still alive, Anna was
   just like the other teenagers in Muskeet, and Kate was sick of having
   to drag her out of the Doom Room every weekend. Then Anna overdosed on
   drugs, so Kate decided to sell her to the MC, although she was still
   alive.

   Kate is pistol whipped multiple times by the MC and tries to explain to
   Peggy that she sold Anna because she was always in trouble, and they
   had nothing, the money Peggy's father had allegedly left them is a lie,
   they have been living off the money the MC paid her for Anna. Furious
   at what her mother did, Peggy trades her for Anna, and buries her
   sister, whom she considers her last remaining family. In the end, Peggy
   becomes another Muskeet teenager, now romantically involved with Jak,
   and watches as Kate's corpse is beaten with electric rods and forced to
   dance in the Doom Room.
