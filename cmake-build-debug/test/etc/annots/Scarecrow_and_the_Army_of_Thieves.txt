   During a routine re-staffing of Dragon Island, an old Soviet weapons
   installation in the Arctic, a Russian Spetsnaz team comes under fire
   from an unknown enemy. Vasily Ivanov, a researcher assigned to Dragon,
   manages to send out a distress signal which is intercepted by an
   American listening station in Alaska before his plane is shot down.
   Dragon Island was once the cornerstone of Soviet weapons research, a
   place where cutting-edge weapons were designed by scientists with a
   blank cheque. It has been seized by an organisation calling themselves
   "The Army of Thieves", led by the enigmatic Lord of Anarchy.
   Self-proclaimed anarchists, the Army is made up of former enforcers of
   the Pinochet regime, Sudanese Janjaweed militants, Islamic
   fundamentalists and narco-terrorists. They are planning to unleash
   Dragon Island's centrepiece, known as the Tesla Weapon. Experiments
   with rocket fuel and samples of acids acquired from the atmosphere of
   Venus have created a compound that, when ignited, can set fire to the
   atmosphere. The Tesla Weapons was constructed on Dragon Island as
   prevailing air currents will disperse the acid-fuel mixture around the
   world. The Army of Thieves have taken control of the facility on Dragon
   Island and have activated the preliminary stages of the Tesla Weapon.

   Still reeling from the events of Scarecrow, United States Marine Corps
   Captain Shane Schofield has been reassigned to an equipment-testing
   project in the Arctic; this equipment includes BRT-E, or "Bertie", a
   multi-functional, independently intelligent robot. Although cleared for
   active duty, Schofield is seen as a liability by the Corps, and has
   spent most of his time teaching new recruits. His situation is somewhat
   complicated by an outstanding bounty on his head; although members of
   the Majestic-12 conspiracy are dead, the French government has offered
   to pay the bounty as retaliation for the events of Ice Station and
   Scarecrow. Schofield is one of just two units close to Dragon Island;
   the other is a Navy SEAL team stationed on the USS Miami, a Los
   Angeles-class submarine. Ira Barker, the leader of this unit, warns
   Schofield to stay away from Dragon Island or else risk being caught in
   the crossfire. The SEAL insertion is a disaster, with every member of
   the team being killed off by the Army. With no other choice, Schofield
   makes for Dragon Island.

   Schofield and his unit locate the remains of Ivanov's downed plane, and
   manage to rescue him while the Army attack. However, they are
   interrupted by the arrival of a French submarine; the French government
   has sent an assassin known as Renard after Schofield. Realising the
   threat posed by the Army, Schofield saves Renard and two members of the
   French commando team sent after him, Dubois and Huguenot, also known as
   "The Barbarian", or "Baba" and described as Mother's equal.
   Successfully infiltrating Dragon Island, Renard reveals herself to be
   Veronique Champion, cousin to Luc Champion, a French researcher killed
   in Ice Station. She agrees to help Schofield stop the Army, but pledges
   to kill him once the threat ends. They question Ivanov, who reveals
   that in order to fire the Tesla weapon, the Army needs to seed the
   atmosphere with the acid-rocket fuel mixture, before firing a battery
   of missiles armed with red uranium into the cloud. Schofield decides to
   target the red uranium and throw it into the Arctic Ocean.

   As Schofield and his team begin to fight their way through the
   installation, David Fairfax - his friend in the Defense Intelligence
   Agency - begins to research the Army and Dragon Island. He grows
   suspicious that an irregular army such as the Army of Thieves would be
   able to carry out a string of attacks against high-value targets to arm
   themselves, and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds a CIA
   operative named Marius Calderon was writing about Dragon Island before
   the Soviet Union actually built anything there. He confirms that the
   Lord of Anarchy is actually Calderon, the CIA's foremost expert on
   psychological operations and gifted with extraordinary foresight;
   Calderon predicted the rise of China as an economic superpower by 2010
   as early as 1982. Fairfax realises that Calderon let the Soviet Union
   discover the plans to the Tesla Weapon, and that the acid-rocket fuel
   mix will be distributed by the jetstream over China, India and Europe;
   once ignited, these regions will be decimated, but the United States
   will be relatively unaffected and able to preserve its position as the
   world's only economic superpower. Calderon succeeds in firing a missile
   armed with red uranium into the gas cloud, igniting it, but it is
   revealed that Ira Barker survived the SEAL team's assault and was able
   to shut down the gas diffusion process long enough to create a safe
   buffer, thereby limiting the ignition. However, Calderon still has
   several missiles at his disposal, and the larger gas cloud is well
   within their range.

   Schofield destroys the red uranium primers one by one, but most of team
   is captured before he can destroy the last two. He and his team are
   tortured by Calderon - Mother and Baba have their heads locked in
   wooden boxes with hungry rats - before Schofield is electrocuted and
   his signature sunglasses claimed as a prize by Calderon. He is revived
   by Bertie and finds Mother and Baba survived by biting the heads off
   the rats locked in with them. They then give chase to Calderon before
   he can either launch the final missile, or detonate a warhead on board
   a cargo plane. Calderon escapes by ejecting a stolen mini-submersible
   from his plane, but Schofield ejects the last missile from the plane
   before it can ignite the gas cloud. The subsequent explosion disables
   Calderon's submarine; he is found two weeks later by a Norwegian
   fishing trawler, having suffocated at the bottom of the ocean.

   With the threat posed by the Army finally over, the Russian government
   authorises a missile strike on Dragon Island. Schofield races back to
   the facility and gathers his unit in a nuclear bunker hidden under a
   laboratory. The missile destroys Dragon Island and kills the remnants
   of the Army. Schofield and his team are found alive and well several
   days later, having survived the blast. They are commended by the
   President for their actions, and the French government lift the bounty
   on Schofield's head for rescuing Veronique's team. Having finally come
   to terms with the death of Elizabeth Gant, Schofield starts a
   relationship with Veronique Champion - however, upon returning to the
   Marine barracks, he finds his sunglasses in his room, implying that
   Marius Calderon is alive.
