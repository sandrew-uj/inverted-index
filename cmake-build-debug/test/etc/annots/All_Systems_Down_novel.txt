   All Systems Down begins with a North Korean cyberattack that destroys
   infrastructure across Western nations, including banks, dams, and the
   power grid. Russia invades Eastern Europe while China and North Korea
   invade several US-allied nations in Asia.

   The book focuses on one character in particular, Brendan Chogan, an
   out-of-work parking enforcement officer. While interviewing for a
   security guard position, Brendan recognizes danger when a computer
   virus strikes Portland, Oregon, destroying internet access across the
   city. This is just the beginning of the attacks. Soon, the country
   descends into further chaos when citizens nationwide lose their
   cellular service and electricity. Traffic backs up as vehicles are
   hacked. Local water systems collapse as generators fail.

   Meanwhile, hacker Xandra Strandlien's boss at U.S. Cyber Command sends
   her to Oregon. Intelligence on Chinese-Russian joint military exercises
   has led to a fear of a post-cyberattack armed invasion, and the Oregon
   Coast, which has no military bases nearby, is a potential target.

   As Brendan and Vailea struggle to secure their home and stockpile food
   and water, the city descends into chaos. It's there they meet up with
   refugees, whose storylines converge on Portland. These characters
   include Kelly and Orion, a pair of pilots whose Super Hornet gave out
   over the Pacific Ocean, and Annalore and Ireana, campers forced to
   cross the Coastal mountain range with their children. Both sets of
   refugees witnessed first-hand the invasion on the Oregon Coast -- an
   armada of Chinese and Russian ships that have slammed into the shore
   near Tillamook.

   At the same time, Xandra has flown across the country with a civilian
   pilot, Lorenzo, and his daughter Carmen. Each of the several groups has
   faced enormous challenges with the collapse of modern technology,
   fleeing and fighting as necessary, to finally converge at the home of
   Brendan and Vailea.

   It's here they concoct a plan not just to survive the cyber war, but to
   hit back against the enemy.

   Kelly and Orion had spotted a Russian submarine in the Willamette
   River, which leads Xandra to reformulate some of the code the North
   Koreans used to dismantle the US Navy. Brendan, Xandra, Kelly -- and to
   Lorenzo's dismay, Carmen -- jump out of Lorenzo's plane and into the
   river, adjacent to the submarine.

   When Xandra is shot, she gives Brendan a thumb drive with the code, and
   with Kelly's help they sneak onto the submarine and upload the malware
   to the Russian intrafleet computer. The code does more damage than they
   could have hoped for. Not only does it disable the Russian submarine,
   but it also spreads across the armada.

   In North Korea and in China, the hacking units are celebrating their
   victory. But even as they're holding victory parades, the lights in
   their cities go suddenly dark. The code they built to destroy the
   imperialists has slipped its orbit and come home to them. Blackouts
   cascade across the region.

   The cyber war isn't over.
