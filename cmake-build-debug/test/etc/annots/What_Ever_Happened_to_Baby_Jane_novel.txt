   This gothic story deals with two aging sisters, Jane and Blanche
   Hudson, who are living alone together in a decaying Hollywood mansion.
   A former child star of early vaudeville known as "Baby Jane", Jane was
   doted upon by her father due to her success on the stage while Blanche
   lived in her shadow, neglected. However, their roles were reversed
   after the death of their parents due to influenza, when both children
   moved to Los Angeles to live with an aunt. Blanche was favored by
   directors for her blonde hair and regal beauty, and finally decided to
   pursue a very successful film career. Blanche became a star, while
   Jane, whose attempts at making movies always resulted in failure,
   languished in her shadow. Blanche managed to keep her sister's career
   alive by having a clause in her contract stipulating that Jane have a
   role in every film in which Blanche appeared, but these were always
   minor parts that relegated Jane to the same neglect Blanche had
   suffered.

   Years later, Jane, who still dresses as if she were ten years old, and
   Blanche, disabled after a mysterious car accident, continue to live
   together in the same mansion in a declining neighborhood. Jane resents
   how her career has been all but forgotten compared to Blanche's (who
   became more famous than she ever was, and who is now being remembered
   because of a revival of her films on television), and hates having to
   cook, clean and care for her sister. Although stuck upstairs in her
   bedroom, Blanche has nevertheless managed to keep her good looks, while
   Jane's appearance is ravaged by years of alcoholism.

   Blanche, whose only other contact with the outside world is the
   mansion's cleaning woman, Edna Stitt, and the telephone conversations
   she occasionally has with her doctor and attorney, realizes that Jane
   is becoming increasingly unstable. She calls her lawyer and tells him
   that she is planning to sell the house. Jane, who eavesdrops on her
   sister's calls, believes that Blanche intends to have her committed to
   a mental hospital. Blanche becomes aware of her sister's sinister mood
   swings and tries to explain her decision, but Jane simply ignores her.
   Soon, Jane begins to exhibit signs of insanity. She removes the phone
   from Blanche's room, while making her afraid to eat by serving
   Blanche's dead pet bird on a salad and, later, a large rat from the
   cellar. In a drunken daze, Jane also decides to resurrect her old Baby
   Jane stage act, reasoning that Fanny Brice had success with Baby
   Snooks. She hires a musical accompanist, Edwin Flagg, through a help
   wanted ad.

   As reality topples crazily into eerie fantasy, Jane begins to abuse her
   sister with monstrous cruelty, while embezzling her money to buy liquor
   and finance her comeback. Edna becomes uneasy when she is unable to
   reach Blanche on the phone and Jane refuses to let her clean her
   sister's room. Opening the door to find Blanche tied to the bed with
   her mouth taped shut, she tries to help, but Jane sneaks up and kills
   Edna with a hammer. That night, Jane dumps the body. A day or two
   later, police officers come questioning Jane about Edna's
   disappearance. Jane panics, grabs her barely conscious sister, and
   heads for the location of some of her happiest childhood memories: the
   beach where she and her father used to practice her song and dance
   routine while crowds of onlookers watched. Jane plays in the sand,
   while Blanche lies weak and on the verge of death from starvation and
   abuse.

   Realizing that she may be dying, Blanche reveals to Jane that it was
   actually she, not Jane, who was responsible for paralyzing her. After
   Jane humiliated Blanche at a party years earlier, her sister tried to
   run her over before Jane got out of the way. The car then slammed into
   a metal gate, snapping Blanche's spine. She managed to crawl out of the
   car to the gates, while Jane, frightened and drunk, hid inside the
   house, where she passed out. When the police arrived, they assumed that
   Jane had been driving. Blanche later realized that the event had driven
   her sister insane with guilt, but refused to allow her to seek
   psychiatric help for fear that Jane might recover enough to remember
   what really happened and would then leave her. Realizing that all the
   years of hatred and resentment between the sisters could have been
   avoided, Jane forgives Blanche.

   Jane calls the police and tells them that her sister is very sick.
   Outside the phone booth, three officers recognize her and gently take
   Jane back to the beach. They start to question her and ask her where
   her sister is. At first, Jane vaguely tells them where to find Blanche,
   leading them down the beach. She then becomes confused and ignores
   their questions. Upon mentioning her name "Miss Hudson", Jane is taken
   back to her vaudeville days, and she begins to dance "very prettily",
   despite the police imploring her to tell them where Blanche is. The
   novel ends with Jane dancing, and does not reveal if Blanche survives
   or not.
