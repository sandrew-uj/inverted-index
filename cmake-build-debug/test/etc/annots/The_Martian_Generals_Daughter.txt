   Map of the world described in the novel. The Pan-Polarian Empire is
   delineated in red, with territories mentioned as tributaries in maroon.
   The approximate locations of the Empire's primary rivals, Persia and
   China, are indicated in green and yellow, respectively.

   As with his previous work Fitzpatrick's War, The Martian General's
   Daughter borrows heavily from classical history; in this case, the
   setting is reminiscent of the Roman Empire during the reign of Marcus
   Aurelius and his son, Commodus. Unlike Fitzpatrick's War, Judson
   provides little background to explain how the world evolved into the
   shape set forth in the novel. The story takes place in the late
   twenty-third century, in which much of the Northern Hemisphere, as well
   as extraplanetary colonies on Mars and Jupiter, are dominated by the
   Pan-Polarian Empire, which is implicitly descended from the United
   States of America (though this is never expressly stated, references
   are made to the "old capital" near Maryland.) Pan-Polarian society is
   based on that of Imperial Rome, including an imperial cult and a
   variety of polytheistic and monolatric religions that have largely
   replaced the major religions of our time, including the cults of "El
   Bis" and the goddess Marilyn. The Empire's primary rivals are Persia
   and China, but which also fights against a number of enemies in Africa
   and South America. A nano-engineered plague has been released by one of
   the warring parties which causes metal to corrode and become useless;
   as a result, advanced technology is beginning to fail and the world is
   quickly degenerating to pre-industrial technology. The setting
   alternates between chronicling the career of General Black (and his
   daughter's career as his aide-de-camp) during the 2270s and 2280s and
   his attempt to seize the Imperial throne in the 2290s during a
   multi-party struggle resembling the Year of the Four Emperors and the
   Crisis of the Third Century. General Black makes his career fighting
   under philosopher-emperor Mathias the Glistening, who perishes when his
   cybernetic implants become infected with the nano-plague. Mathias is
   succeeded by his sociopathic son, Luke Anthony, whose behavior becomes
   increasingly erratic over time. Justa relates the excesses of
   Luke's regime, including his execution of perceived enemies, financial
   corruption, sexual perversion, etc. General Black is made governor
   of Anatolia but is periodically recalled to provide various services to
   Luke. As a result of personally witnessing the Emperor's madness,
   General Black becomes more and more disillusioned and his health begins
   to suffer. Ultimately Luke is murdered and a struggle ensues between
   various short-reigned barracks emperors. By this time General Black and
   Justa are stationed on Mars, but when one of Black's political rivals
   seizes power, kills Black's family on Earth and infects Mars with the
   metal-eating nanoplague, Black's troops (many of them Boers, who are
   described as largely nomadic in the twenty-third century) declare him
   emperor and he leads an invasion force back to Earth. Although
   victorious in battle, the nanoplague renders the conflict moot as
   technology will no longer support an empire as large as the
   Pan-Polarian state, which crumbles into a myriad of ethnic and regional
   successor states. Ultimately, Justa and her father settle in Amsterdam,
   which has regained the prominence it enjoyed in the seventeenth and
   eighteenth centuries and is the center of a prosperous successor state,
   where Justa marries, has children, and assiduously avoids politics.
