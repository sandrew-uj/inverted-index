   The Earthman Elijah Baley (the detective hero of the previous Robot
   books) has died nearly two centuries earlier. During these two
   centuries, Earth-people have overcome their agoraphobia and resumed
   space colonization, using faster-than-light drive to reach distant
   planets beyond the earlier "Spacer" worlds. Their inhabitants, calling
   themselves "Settlers" rather than "Spacers", revere Earth as their
   mother-world.

   Baley's memory remains in the mind of his former lover, Gladia
   Delmarre, a long-lived "Spacer" who uncharacteristically relocated from
   the spacer world of Solaria to Aurora. Gladia's homeworld and the
   50th-established of the Spacer planets, Solaria, has become empty of
   all human inhabitants, although millions of robot servants remain. A
   seventh-generation descendant of Baley's, Daneel Giskard ('D.G.')
   Baley, gains Gladia's help in visiting Solaria, to investigate the
   destruction of several "Settler" spaceships that made landings there,
   and to capture the presumably unsupervised robots. Gladia is
   accompanied by the positronic robots R. Daneel Olivaw and R. Giskard
   Reventlov, both the former property of their creator, Dr. Han Fastolfe,
   who bequeathed them to Gladia in his will. R. Giskard has secret
   telepathic powers of which only R. Daneel knows.

   At the same time, Daneel and Giskard are engaged in a struggle of wits
   with Fastolfe's rivals: The roboticists Kelden Amadiro and Vasilia
   Aliena, Fastolfe's estranged daughter. Frustrated by his series of
   failures, Amadiro accepts an ambitious and unscrupulous apprentice,
   Levular Mandamus, who plans to destroy the population of the Earth by a
   newly developed weapon, the "nuclear intensifier", with which to
   accelerate the natural radioactive decay in the upper crust of the
   Earth, thereby making the surface of the Earth radioactive. R. Daneel
   and R. Giskard discover the roboticists' plan, and attempt to stop
   Amadiro; but are hampered by the First Law of Robotics,

     A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a
     human being to come to harm.

   which prevents them from a direct attack on Amadiro. Daneel and
   Giskard, meanwhile, have inferred an additional Zeroth Law of Robotics:

     A robot may not injure humanity, or through inaction, allow humanity
     to come to harm.

   which might enable them to overcome Amadiro, if they can use their
   telepathic perception of humanity to quell the inhibitions of the first
   law. When Vasilia accuses Giskard of telepathy (earlier created by
   herself) Giskard is compelled to manipulate her mind to make her forget
   about his telepathic powers. The two robots locate Amadiro and Mandamus
   on Earth, at the site of Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. After
   Amadiro admits their plans, Giskard alters Amadiro's brain (using the
   newly created Zeroth Law); but in so doing, threatens his own.

   Now alone with the robots, Mandamus claims that his intentions were to
   draw out the radioactive catastrophe over many decades, rather than the
   mere years that Amadiro wanted, and Giskard, believing it best for
   humanity to abandon the Earth, allows Mandamus to do this (resulting in
   the situation depicted by Pebble in the Sky), and deprives Mandamus of
   the memory of doing so. Giskard predicts, correctly, that by forcing
   humanity into leaving the Earth, vigor will be reintroduced into
   mankind and the new Settlers will populate space until all the
   governments of the interstellar colonies form a "Galactic Empire".
   Under the stress of changing the course of humanity (against First and
   Zeroth Laws), R. Giskard himself suffers a soon-fatal malfunction of
   his positronic brain and confers his telepathic ability upon R. Daneel.
