   The book deals at length with such issues as nuclear power and its
   dangers/benefits; the loss of a wife and the effect it has on a family;
   the bond of siblings; the use and manifestations of both psychosis and
   duty; and, finally, the love among family members. The book is also
   notable in that Dalgliesh himself does not actually solve the crime;
   the book instead begins with different characters carrying on their
   lives with the bleak backdrop of a controversial power station and a
   prowling serial killer. Soon, however, after the copycat murder that
   propels the book along, we watch the characters interact, react, and
   strike out at one another, although very little actual detecting takes
   place.
