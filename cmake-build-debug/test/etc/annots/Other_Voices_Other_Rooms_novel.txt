   After his mother's death, 13-year-old Joel Harrison Knox, a lonely,
   effeminate boy, is sent from New Orleans, Louisiana, to live with his
   father, who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at
   Skully's Landing, a vast, decaying mansion on an isolated plantation in
   Mississippi, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, Amy's cousin
   Randolph, a gay man and dandy, the defiant tomboy Idabel, a girl who
   becomes his friend, and Jesus and Zoo, the two black caretakers of the
   home. He also sees a spectral "queer lady" with "fat dribbling curls"
   watching him from a top window. Despite Joel's queries, the whereabouts
   of his father remain a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his
   father, Joel is stunned to find he is a mute quadriplegic, having
   tumbled down a flight of stairs after being inadvertently shot by
   Randolph and nearly dying. Joel runs away with Idabel to a carnival and
   meets a woman with dwarfism; on a Ferris wheel, the woman attempts to
   touch Joel in a sexual manner and is rebuffed. Looking for Idabel in a
   storm, Joel catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing,
   where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the
   final paragraph is that the "queer lady" beckoning from the window is
   actually Randolph, dressed in an old Mardi Gras costume.
