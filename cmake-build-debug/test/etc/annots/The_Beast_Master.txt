   The Beast Master tells of Hosteen Storm, a Navajo^[2] and former
   soldier who has empathic and telepathic connections with a group of
   genetically altered animals. The team emigrates from Earth to the
   distant planet Arzor where it is hired to herd livestock. Storm still
   harbors anger at his former enemies, the Xik, and has sworn revenge on
   a man named Quade for his father's murder. According to Kirkus he finds
   "life and hope" instead.^[2]

   In this novel and its sequels, Norton explores aspects of Native
   American culture, specifically the Navajo, through metaphors in Storm's
   life and in the culture he adopts on his adopted planet.
