   A bomb and Kamal Dajani arrive in New York City by freighter. The bomb
   was built by Kamal's brother Whalid, a nuclear scientist, in Libya.
   Although Whalid and Kamal made a Muslim vow on pain of death to avenge
   their father's death and loss of their West Bank home, Whalid had
   originally dedicated his life to peaceful nuclear energy at Cadarache.
   That was until Kamal was ready to enforce the vow. French police
   subsequently arrested Kamal, Whalid, and their sister Laila, and
   deported them to Beirut so as not to jeopardize the politics of nuclear
   energy. When the police questioned Whalid's French wife, she committed
   suicide. Kamal and their mother exploited the event for Whalid
   (suggested murder plus rape) and she bade them help Gaddafi in Libya.

   Laila, in disguise, personally delivers the written threat from Gaddafi
   to the White House, with instructions on how to retrieve technical
   designs as proof from an airport locker. The President (unnamed, but
   resembling Jimmy Carter in age, religiosity, Navy service, etc.) and
   his team agonize over the bomb design and the final assessment by the
   Department of Energy that it is a three megaton H-bomb.

   The nuclear search team NEST is activated, travelling via Starlifter
   cargo plane from Nevada to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey.
   Meanwhile, combined teams of New York City police and FBI, including
   New York police detective Angelo Rocchia and FBI agent Mike Rand,
   conduct a shoe-leather investigation field research on the incoming
   shipment, the false and stolen documents, and the three terrorists,
   moving ever closer to the truth in a logical progression, to look for
   "a barrel of chlorine gas."

   It looks bleak for NEST. Its equipment can only look so far down from
   the air and only so far up from the street. Even a water bed could
   neutralize the radioactive emissions of the bomb. Also, other
   terrorists help to confuse NEST, by attaching radioactive pellets to
   the legs of pigeons and setting them loose.

   It also looks bleak for New York City, whose mayor, Abe Stern, is
   summoned to the White House under false pretenses and told face-to-face
   by the President of the nuclear threat. Not only has evacuation been
   ruled out by Gaddafi, but some fallout shelters are loaded with junk,
   susceptible to flooding, or badly stocked, with no supplies or rotten
   supplies. New York City's air raid sirens were literally falling down.
   New York City did have a good radio / TV public address system for the
   mayor, but it was unmistakably clear that up to eight million people in
   and around the city would die of burns, blast, flying debris, or
   radiation, and New England would get the fallout immediately after. New
   York City officials contemplate evacuation plans but scrap them because
   few people have cars, and civilian train operators cannot be counted on
   to work in a crisis.

   Israel's military leaders do not trust the President during this
   crisis. Israel launches an air strike against Libya, using F-4 Phantoms
   and their plutonium atom bombs, and an electronic countermeasures
   plane, which proceeds until the French ambassador (an Israeli general
   warned the U.S. Embassy) warns Israel that the Soviets will launch a
   nuclear strike against Israel unless the strike is aborted. Begin,
   horrified, deduces that the US President asked the Soviets to keep
   Israel in line, and backs down. Menachem Begin will not vacate the West
   Bank settlements, as demanded by Gaddafi; the Israeli Army might even
   mutiny if ordered to vacate the settlements.

   Rand and Rocchia make progress: first, checking bills of lading from
   the harbor, and questioning longshoremen about unusual activity.
   Further checking determines a discrepancy between what was listed on a
   cargo ship's manifest and what actually made it to the destination.
   Rand and Rocchia check the rental vehicle involved, and discover that
   it was rented with a stolen driver's license. The owner of the license,
   who recently lost it to a pickpocket, Mr. Gerald Putman, reviewing
   photographs, identifies Carmen, a Colombian whose large breasts help
   distract her victims. Rocchia invents a criminal incident to persuade
   an Italian woman to tell him where Carmen lives. Capturing her and her
   associate Pedro Torres leads them to a Jewish document forger, Benny
   Muscowitz. Rocchia's aggressive manner makes Benny finally invoke his
   right against self-incrimination, but Rand is able, without giving too
   many details about the Israeli crisis, to encourage Benny to talk. A
   French nuclear scientist who worked in Libya, Paul-Henri de Serre,
   turns out to be an art thief whom the Libyans set up. Paul-Henri
   identifies Whalid and Kamal, and the French fax the records of Whalid,
   Kamal, and Laila to the CIA. A short time later, Rand and Rocchia
   arrest Nabil Suleiman, who was wanted by Israel for a terrorist attack,
   and threaten to deport him, for lack of a U.S. visa, directly into the
   custody of a Mossad agent waiting outside, unless he becomes a witness
   in the case. Nabil is able to identify Laila and Kamal based on the
   French photos. Further questioning of New York citizens establishes
   that the same rental truck was in the location in question at the time
   in question.

   The President has briefed the Rapid Deployment Force, in transit to
   Lebanon, with options to invade the West Bank.

   Rocchia is very upset when he asks a nuclear technician what he's
   carrying and the technician honestly indicates, "Geiger counter". He
   feels betrayed that the FBI would be told the truth, but not the New
   York City police, like himself. Rocchia's superior manages to calm him
   down. Because Rocchia has produced good leads, he wants to take his
   daughter (who has Down syndrome) far north from the city. Rocchia is
   free to go, on the condition that he remain silent. He tries to ask the
   Catholic school for children with disabilities for permission to take
   her "to see relatives." The nun accedes, but in the meantime, Rocchia
   sees dozens of other children, all with disabilities, who will be
   incinerated if the bomb goes off. The nun no longer see Rocchia when
   she returns with his daughter; Rocchia has left.

   The President consults his advisors again. One finally says that during
   the oil embargo and the Iranian hostage crisis, when the Europeans
   wavered, it was Israel who stood by the United States. At the same
   time, a crucial deadline passes but the nuclear bomb does not explode.
   Now a safe distance away from the bomb, Whalid finally tells his
   brother Kamal that he did not build the bomb to incinerate New York
   City residents, he did it to bring Libya to nuclear parity with Israel,
   the Soviets, France, China, Britain, and America. Whalid had
   deliberately given the wrong instructions to the computer while his
   brother and sister had been working on the antenna on the roof. He had
   to buy a three pack of audio cassettes at the start of the novel, so
   substituting a fake cassette was easy. Whalid, in self defense, tries
   to shoot his brother, and misses; Kamal breaks Whalid's trachea with an
   expert martial arts maneuver, causing Whalid to slowly suffocate to
   death. Kamal grabs the detonation checklist and Laila, and drives back
   to the bomb to detonate it himself, manually.

   The President makes a decision. He is not merely the President of the
   people in New York City: he is the President of all Americans, and
   America is being bullied to invade an ally. This is an act of war, not
   just a crime. Finally, he orders two nuclear submarines to aim their
   SLBMs at Libya, and orders his admiral to launch them unless the bomb
   is found and defused, or unless Gaddafi extends his latest ultimatum.

   Gaddafi reports that the President's acceptance of the original terms
   is not acceptable. One of Gaddafi's own ministers protests that America
   has capitulated. Gaddafi replies that the Americans are stalling for
   time. The President finally levies his nuclear threat. Gaddafi is the
   only cool head as his intelligence chief panics.

   Meanwhile, a suspicious neighbor hears the gunshot (when Whalid tries
   to kill his brother) and calls the police, who identify Whalid based on
   a tattoo. The New York City police and FBI know for certain whom
   they're looking for. Kamal gets out of the car and tells Laila to drive
   to Montreal. He then steals an ambulance to finish his drive to the
   bomb. Rand and Rocchia hear about the ambulance on the radio, see it,
   and chase it. Rocchia cautiously enters the building where Kamal is
   working with the bomb. "Police! Don't move!" Kamal expertly fires a
   succession of shots from an automatic pistol. Rocchia drops to the
   floor, safe, but forced to keep silent. Rand tries to enter the
   building, thinking Rocchia is wounded. Rocchia can't warn Rand because
   he'd betray his position. Rand ultimately becomes Kamal's target, and
   is fatally wounded by Kamal; the encounter enables Rocchia to kill
   Kamal with two shots.

   The nuclear scientists review their options. After determining that the
   case is safe to open, they choose ultraviolet radiation to burn out the
   microprocessor, and New York is safe.

   This leaves Laila as a loose end. Not surprisingly, because she's eager
   to get to Canada, she drives fast, speeding slightly. A police car
   gives chase, and Laila almost manages to lose the police car, but she
   hits a stretch of black ice, loses control, and crashes in the opposite
   lane. The car's gas tank explodes, and Laila is burned alive. "Whatever
   got into her?" the officer asks. "All I had her for was seven miles
   over the limit."

   The President's men want revenge. Carter will not murder two million
   Libyans, the families Salam Jalloud referred to in his protest to
   Gaddafi.

   "Heck," somebody grumbles, "Israel will."

   By the end of the story, Libya's east coast has nuclear-armed SCUDs
   facing Israel, both countries facing "the prospect of mutual suicide."

   What Carter does do is send Gaddafi a telegram quoting the Quran:
   "Whoever ye shall be, death will overtake you, even though ye reside in
   lofty towers."
