   One evening at Herrington High School in Ohio, teachers and Principal
   Drake leave after discussing the school's budget. When Drake returns to
   retrieve her keys, she is attacked by the school's football coach, Joe
   Willis. Drama teacher Mrs. Olson emotionlessly stabs Drake with
   scissors as she flees the school.

   The following morning, the students arrive, including Casey Connor, the
   dedicated but perpetually harassed photographer for the school
   newspaper. Casey is the unappreciated assistant to spiteful Delilah
   Profitt, the paper's editor-in-chief and head cheerleader. Delilah's
   mistreated boyfriend Stan Rosado is contemplating quitting the football
   team to pursue academics. Zeke Tyler is an intelligent yet rebellious
   student repeating his senior year. Zeke sells, among other illegal
   items, a powdery ecstasy-like drug he manufactures and distributes; he
   is confronted by teacher Elizabeth Burke, who expresses concern for him
   over his illegal activities. Naive transfer student Marybeth Louise
   Hutchinson befriends self-styled outcast Stokely Mitchell, who has
   deliberately spread rumors that she is a lesbian though she has a crush
   on Stan. Marybeth develops a crush on Zeke.

   Casey finds a strange creature on the football field and takes it to
   science teacher Mr. Furlong, who believes it is a new species of
   cephalopod-specific parasite called a mesozoan. Delilah and Casey hide
   in the teachers' lounge to find a story. They witness Coach Willis and
   Ms. Olson forcing one of the parasites into the ear of the school
   nurse. They also find the body of another teacher, Mrs. Brummel. Casey
   and Delilah flee, and Casey calls the police, but his claims are
   dismissed.

   The next day, Casey tells Delilah, Stan and Stokely he believes the
   teachers are being controlled by aliens. After Zeke and Marybeth tease
   them about their theory, Mr. Furlong attempts to infect them. Zeke
   injects his homemade drugs into Furlong's eye, killing him. Zeke takes
   the five to his house, where he experiments on a specimen retrieved by
   Casey. He discovers it needs water to survive and can be killed by his
   drugs. Zeke makes everyone take his drug to prove they are uninfected.
   Delilah is revealed as infected and she destroys Zeke's lab and most of
   his drug supply before escaping.

   Acting on Stokely's speculation that killing the alien queen will
   revert everyone to normal, the group returns to the school, where their
   football team is playing and infecting opposing players. Believing
   Principal Drake to be the queen, they isolate her in the gym and
   fatally shoot her. Stan confronts the coach and team to see if the plan
   worked, but becomes infected himself. Zeke and Casey retrieve more of
   Zeke's drugs from his car. Casey leads infected students away from
   Zeke, who encounters Miss Burke in the parking lot and incapacitates
   her.

   At the gym, Marybeth reveals herself to be the alien queen; earlier on,
   she faked taking the drug. Casey and Stokely flee to the swimming pool,
   where Stokely is injured and becomes infected. Zeke and Casey hide in
   the locker room, where Marybeth reverts to her human disguise. She
   explains she is taking over Earth because her own planet is dying.
   Marybeth transforms back into her true form and hurls Zeke across the
   room into the lockers, knocking him out. Casey seizes the drug and
   traps the queen behind retracting bleachers. He stabs the drug into the
   queen's eye. Casey returns to the locker room and finds Stokely and
   Zeke alive.

   One month later, everyone has returned to normal. Stan and Stokely, who
   has shed her Goth girl image, are now dating. Zeke has taken Stan's
   place on the football team, while Miss Burke affectionately watches him
   practice. Delilah, no longer vindictive, is now dating Casey, who is
   considered a local hero as various news media reveal the attempted
   alien invasion is now public knowledge, even as the FBI denies it.
