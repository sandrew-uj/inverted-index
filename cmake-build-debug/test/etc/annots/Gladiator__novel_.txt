   Gladiator is a science fiction novel by American author Philip Wylie,
   first published in 1930. The story concerns a scientist who invents an
   "alkaline free-radical" serum to "improve" humankind by granting the
   proportionate strength of an ant and the leaping ability of the
   grasshopper. The scientist injects his pregnant wife with the serum and
   his son Hugo Danner is born with superhuman strength, speed, and
   bulletproof skin. Hugo spends much of the novel hiding his powers,
   rarely getting a chance to openly use them.

   The novel is widely assumed to have been an inspiration for Superman
   due to similarities between Danner and the earliest versions of
   Superman who debuted in 1938,^[1] though no confirmation exists that
   Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were directly influenced
   by Wylie's work.^[2]
