   Original UK cover by Larry Rostant

   Christian Huxley enters Ryhope wood on a search for the compelling
   mythago Guiwenneth and for a better understanding of his mother's
   suicide. Inside the wood he joins a small group of mythago companions
   who, in turn, join a vast army of mythagos, numbering in the thousands.
   This army includes many mythic archetypes including shaman,
   shapeshifters, and warriors. Among these mythagos are those whose
   creation is influenced by King Arthur and the Welsh tales of the
   Mabinogion, specifically the tale of Culhwch and Olwen. Echoing the
   tales of Culhwch and Olwen, Christian is assigned with completing many
   impossible tasks. Holdstock uses the story within a story device to
   have Kylhuk retell a tale involving himself, Olwen and Pwyll, among
   others.

   This army, known as a legion, is pursued by the angry dead on its
   search for the gates to the underworld. As Christian nears the end of
   his quest in the wood, he has an opportunity to enter the underworld
   (like Orpheus) and grapple with the suicide of his mother which has two
   very different manifestations, one true and one false. While in the
   underworld he is also faced with a difficult choice of rescuing only
   one of two loved ones from death.^[3]
