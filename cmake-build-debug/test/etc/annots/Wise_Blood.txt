   Recently discharged from service in World War II and surviving on a
   government pension for unspecified battle wounds, Hazel Motes returns
   to his family home in Tennessee to find it abandoned. Leaving behind a
   note claiming a chifforobe as his private property, Motes boards a
   train for Taulkinham. The grandson of a traveling preacher, Motes grew
   up struggling with doubts regarding salvation and original sin;
   following his experiences at war, Motes has become an avowed atheist
   and intends to spread a gospel of antireligion. Despite his aversion to
   all trappings of Christianity, he constantly contemplates theological
   issues and finds himself compelled to purchase a hat and suit that
   cause others to mistake him for a minister.

   In Taulkinham, Motes initially finds an address in a bathroom stall and
   seeks out Leora Watts, a prostitute. He walks into her house, sits on
   her bed, and places his hand on her shoe without speaking to her first.
   He befriends Enoch Emery, a profane, manic, 18-year-old zookeeper
   forced to come to the city after his abusive father kicked him out of
   their house. Emery introduces Motes to the concept of "wise blood," an
   idea that he has innate, worldly knowledge of what direction to take in
   life, and requires no spiritual or emotional guidance.

   Together, Emery and Motes witness a blind preacher and his teenage
   daughter crash a street vendor's potato peeler demonstration to
   advertise for their ministry. The preacher introduces himself as Asa
   Hawks and his daughter as Sabbath Lily Hawks; Motes finds himself drawn
   to the pair, which Hawks attributes to a repressed desire for religious
   salvation. Angry, Motes begins shouting blasphemies to the crowd and
   declares that he will found his own anti-God street preaching ministry.
   Motes' declarations are lost on everyone except for Emery, who becomes
   infatuated with the idea.

   After Leora destroys his hat for her own amusement, Motes moves into
   the boarding house where Asa and Sabbath Lily live. Motes becomes
   fixated on the 15-year-old Sabbath Lily and begins spending time with
   her. Asa has Sabbath Lily give Motes a newspaper clipping reporting
   Asa's announcement that he will blind himself with quicklime at a
   revival in order to detach himself from worldly pursuits. Initially
   intending to seduce Sabbath Lily in order to corrupt her spiritual
   purity, Motes discovers that she is in fact interested in him.

   Now skeptical of her and of her father's entire ministry, Motes slips
   into Hawks' room one night and finds him without his sunglasses on,
   with perfectly intact eyes: Hawks had faltered when he had attempted to
   blind himself because his faith was not strong enough, and ultimately
   left the ministry to become a con artist. His secret found out, Asa
   flees town, leaving Sabbath Lily to fend for herself. The 15-year-old
   moves in with Motes, and he begins to more aggressively pursue his
   ministry, purchasing a dilapidated car to use as a mobile pulpit.

   Meanwhile, Emery, believing that Motes' church needs a worldly
   "prophet," breaks into a museum attached to the zoo where he works and
   steals a mummified dwarf, which he begins keeping under his sink. He
   ultimately presents it to Sabbath Lily to give to Motes on his behalf;
   when Sabbath Lily appears to Motes cradling it in her arms in a parody
   of the Madonna and Child, Motes experiences a violent revulsion to the
   image and destroys the mummy, throwing its remnants out the window.

   Inspired by Motes' fledgling street ministry, local con artist Hoover
   Shoats renames himself Onnie Jay Holy and forms his own ministry, the
   "Holy Church of Christ Without Christ," which he encourages the
   disenfranchised to join for a donation of $1. The absurdity amuses
   passersby and they begin to join as a joke. This angers Motes, who
   wants to legitimately and freely spread his message of antireligion.
   Despite Motes' protests, Holy moves to the next level in promoting his
   ministry, hiring a homeless, alcoholic man to dress up like Motes and
   act as his "Prophet."

   During a rainstorm, Emery seeks refuge under a theater marquee, and
   learns that as a promotion, a gorilla will be brought to the theater to
   promote a new jungle movie. An excited Emery stands in line to shake
   the gorilla's hand, but is startled to find that the gorilla is
   actually a man in a costume who, unprovoked, tells Emery to "go to
   hell." The incident causes Emery's "wise blood" to give him some
   inarticulated revelation, and he seeks out a program of the "gorilla's"
   future appearances. That night, Emery stalks the man to another
   theater, stabs him with a sharpened umbrella handle, and steals his
   costume. Enoch takes the costume out to the woods, where he strips
   naked and buries his clothes in a shallow "grave" before dressing up as
   the gorilla. Satisfied with his new appearance, he comes out of the
   woods and attempts to greet a couple on a date by shaking their hand.
   Emery is disappointed when they flee in terror, and finds himself alone
   on a rock overlooking Taulkinham.

   Back in town, Motes angrily watches as Holy begins to grow rich from
   his new ministry. One night he follows Holy's "prophet" as he drives
   home (in a car resembling Motes's), which he runs off the road; when
   the man exits the car, the stronger, more forceful Motes threatens him
   and orders him to strip. The man begins to comply, but Motes is
   overcome by a sudden rage and repeatedly runs the man over. Exiting the
   car to ensure he is dead, Motes is startled when the dying man begins
   confessing his sins to Motes.

   The next day, Motes is pulled over by a strange policeman with
   unnaturally blue eyes, who claims to be citing him for driving without
   a license. He orders Motes to drive to a nearby cliff, orders him out
   of the car, then, remarking that someone without a license doesn't need
   a car, pushes it off the cliff. The incident, coupled with the false
   prophet's death, causes Motes to become sullen and withdrawn. Motes
   purchases a tin bucket and sack of quicklime and returns to the
   boarding house. Completing the action that Hawks couldn't finish, he
   blinds himself with the quicklime.

   During an extended period of living as an ascetic at the boarding
   house, he begins walking around with barbed wire wrapped around his
   torso and sharp rocks and pebbles in his shoes, and after paying for
   his room and board, he throws away any remaining money from his
   military pension. Believing that Motes has gone insane, the landlady,
   Mrs. Flood, hatches a plot to marry him, collect on his pension, and
   have him committed to an insane asylum. In attempting to seduce Motes,
   Mrs. Flood instead falls in love with him. After she suggests to Motes
   that they marry and she care for him, Motes wanders off into a
   thunderstorm.

   Motes is found three days later, lying in a ditch and suffering from
   exposure. Angry at being asked to return what they believe is a
   mentally-ill indigent, one of the cops who find Motes strikes him in
   the head with his baton while loading Motes into a police car,
   exacerbating Motes' rapidly deteriorating condition. Motes dies in the
   police car on his way back to the boarding house. When the dead Motes
   is presented to Mrs. Flood, she mistakenly thinks he is still alive.
   She has him placed in bed and cares for his lifeless corpse, telling
   him he can live with her for as long as he likes, free of charge.
   Looking into his empty eye sockets, Mrs. Flood thinks she sees a light
   twinkling inside them.
