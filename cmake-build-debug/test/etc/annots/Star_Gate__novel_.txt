   Long ago people came from beyond the sky and landed on Gorth. There
   they raised the human natives out of the wild state and led them to
   develop a civilization analogous to that of medieval Europe. Then they
   went away, leaving behind a few of their number, memories, and a small
   population of cross-breeds. Kincar s'Rud is one of those cross-breeds.
   Part native and part Star Lord, he has assumed that he will inherit the
   throne of a small fief when his grandfather dies. Instead, his
   grandfather bestows upon him the livery of a Star Lord and warns him to
   leave Styr Holding immediately, because his uncle intends to kill him
   in order to take the throne for himself.

   Riding his larng Cim, the four-eyed analogue of a horse, and
   accompanied by his pterodactyl-like hunting mord, Vorken, he leaves the
   only world he has known, following a map that his grandfather gave him.
   Falling in with a party of cross-breeds and a Star Lord, he helps them
   fight off outlaws and follows them through a pair of luminous webs to
   another Gorth. As they pass through the Star Gate Kincar is burned by
   an amulet, a Tie, that he wears. Joined by others, the group takes
   refuge in an abandoned keep that they find on their new world. Kincar
   meets a healer, Lady Asgar, who treats his burn while Lord Dillan tells
   him about many worlds and travel between them. They have come to a
   Gorth that they had not intended to occupy, so they will have to build
   another Star Gate.

   While out hunting, Kincar captures a small man who was trying to steal
   his kill. Back at the keep the man reacts to the Star Lords' presence
   with fear, telling the refugees that the Star Lords he knows, the Dark
   Ones, are cruel people who have enslaved the native Gorthians. One of
   the Dark Ones is Rud, a doppelgaenger of Kincar's father.

   Kincar volunteers to reconnoiter the lands occupied by the Dark Ones
   and their slaves. Before he can even reach the city where he would spy
   out what the refugees need to know, he is captured and taken to an open
   field to be eaten alive by mords. The Tie burns the thug who tries to
   take it and the mords finish him off while Vorken, who has become
   leader of the flock, protects Kincar.

   Astounded by Kincar's survival, the evil Lords Rud and Dillan take him
   and Vorken to the place where their starships stand grounded.
   Desperate, putting his faith in the Tie, Kincar escapes and goes back
   to the mountains to meet up again with the refugees and the bastard son
   of this Gorth's Rud.

   In the aircar that Kincar used in his escape, the Star Lords go to the
   starships on a day when all of the Dark Lords will be in them. They set
   the automatic controls and send the ships back into space, thereby
   ending the cruel dictatorship of the Dark Ones. The Star Lords then use
   materials that they took from the ships to build another Star Gate and
   they, Kincar, and the other refugees pass through it into yet another
   alternate Gorth.
