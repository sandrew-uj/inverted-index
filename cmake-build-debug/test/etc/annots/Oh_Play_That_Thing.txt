   Having fallen foul of his erstwhile comrades in the Irish Republican
   Army (IRA), Henry escapes to America. In New York City, he becomes
   involved in advertising, pornography and bootlegging. After stepping on
   the toes of the Mob, Henry heads for Chicago, where he becomes the
   manager and partner-in-crime of Louis Armstrong. He becomes reunited
   with his wife and daughter, and, much to his dismay, the IRA.
