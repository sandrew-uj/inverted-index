   A disaster of some type has occurred, of which the audience only knows
   that uncontaminated water is scarce, and livestock has to be burned.
   Having fled Paris, the Laurent family arrives at their country home,
   hoping to find refuge and security, only to discover that it is already
   occupied by strangers.

   The family is assaulted by the strangers and forced to leave, with no
   supplies or transport. As they seek help from people they have known in
   the village, they are repeatedly turned away. The family makes its way
   to a train station where they wait with other survivors, in the hope
   that a train will stop for them and take them back to the city.
