   The story follows the narrative of Bruce Banner and the Hulk following
   a war which ended in a violent nuclear holocaust that only he could
   have survived.

   Banner begins the story saying about how he was originally hulk but
   turned into a person, talking to a camera left by a Vidbot - a floating
   camera hovering at a constant distance of 10 feet away from him -
   belonging to a Recorder that discovered Bruce when analyzing Earth,
   leaving the Vidbot to record the final fate of the last human to
   confirm that humanity was truly gone from the universe.

   While Banner is forced to drown in sorrow as the last human alive on
   Earth, wandering for years across the ruins of the old cities and
   remembering what he can of the world before, the Hulk (in his Rampaging
   Hulk form) is angry at Banner, in that with Banner he is still not
   alone in the world. During one of Banner's walks, he is beset upon some
   gigantic cockroaches, mutated by the nuclear fallout, and it is the
   Hulk who gets up to try to stop them.

   When Banner awakens later, he watches a video recording made by the
   alien camera of the cockroaches eating the Hulk alive before he heals.

   The story is mainly fueled by the fact that Banner and the Hulk's
   desires, even at the end of the world, are still conflicted; whereas
   the Hulk still stubbornly wishes to prove himself the strongest being
   on Earth, Banner merely wishes to die, attempting suicides that always
   fail when he becomes the Hulk again.

   Eventually, Banner falls asleep in an old cave, only to dream of a
   woman with the appearance of Betty Ross. In the dream, he becomes young
   again and they begin to make love amongst a paradise. However, when she
   begins to talk, saying that the two will eventually be 'like gods',
   Banner awakens violently.

   Suffering a painful heart attack, Banner realizes how much his
   punishment resembles that of Prometheus, the last Titan; condemned to
   stay forever alive even while animals devour him, speculating that the
   Hulk's suffering is Earth punishing him for humanity's sins as the
   embodiment of the nuclear wars that destroyed it. As he dies, the
   Hulk's persona arises in his mind. Banner pleads with the Hulk, begging
   him to simply let go of his conflicts, claiming that they are going to
   a paradise where all their dead friends are, where they will be happy.
   The Hulk throws away this suggestion because, in his eyes, friends have
   always betrayed him. Amidst a thunderous storm, the Hulk proclaims that
   all he wants is to be left alone.

   The next morning, the Hulk somberly sits outside the cave, musing in
   his inner monologue: "Banner is gone...got rid of him last night." As
   he remembers the confrontation, he realizes that if he were ever again
   to change back to Banner, he would die also. The Hulk claims to be
   glad, because he does not need Banner, only for the truly tragic
   realization to come upon him: "Hulk...strongest one there is.
   Hulk...only one there is...Hulk feels...cold."
