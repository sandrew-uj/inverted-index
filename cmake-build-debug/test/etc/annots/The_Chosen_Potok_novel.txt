   In 1944 Brooklyn, fifteen-year-old Reuven Malter prepares to play a
   baseball game: his own Modern Orthodox school against a team from an
   ultra-orthodox Hasidic yeshiva. It becomes apparent that the only good
   player on the opposing team is Danny Saunders, the son of nearby
   Hasidic Rabbi Isaac Saunders. The game becomes something of a war
   between the two teams, seemingly symbolic of their differing
   ideologies. In the last inning, with Reuven's team in the lead, Reuven
   is put in as pitcher. When Danny gets up to the plate, he hits a line
   drive straight at Reuven's head, which breaks his glasses and drives a
   small piece of glass into his eye. Reuven's team loses and Reuven is
   rushed to the hospital.

   Danny comes to the hospital in an attempt to apologize, but Reuven is
   still livid at Danny and rejects his attempts, which angers Reuven's
   father, who reminds Reuven it is important to listen to someone who
   asks to be heard. When Danny returns the next day, Reuven forgives him
   and they quickly become friends.

   Reuven learns that Danny possesses a photographic memory, enabling him
   to study an astonishing amount of Talmud per day (set by his father),
   yet still leaving him time to pursue other subjects. Danny tells Reuven
   that he goes to the library to read books on science and literature,
   and that a man at the library has been recommending books for him to
   read. Danny knows that he is expected to someday take over his father's
   position as the rabbi for his community, but wishes he did not have to
   and that instead, he could pursue psychology. Reuven would like to
   become a rabbi, though his father would like him to pursue academia.
   Reuven learns that his father, a teacher of Talmud, is the man who has
   been recommending books to Danny at the library.

   When Reuven is released from the hospital, his father discusses the
   history of Hasidism with him. He then explains that only once in a
   generation a mind like Danny's is born, and that Danny cannot help his
   need for knowledge, but that Danny is also a lonely boy who needs a
   friend.

   The next day, Reuven goes to Danny's family synagogue where he
   witnesses a discussion between Danny and his father which spans over
   the entire Talmud. After the Sabbath has ended, Danny reveals to Reuven
   that his father only speaks to him when they study Talmud together. The
   two boys also discover that they will be attending the same university,
   much to Reuven's delight. That Sunday, Danny and Reuven meet at the
   library, where Danny reveals his fascination with the human mind and
   his desire to study the works of Sigmund Freud, for which he is
   teaching himself German.

   The next week, Reuven goes to the Saunders house again to study Talmud
   with Danny and his father. When Danny leaves the room to prepare tea,
   Rebbe Saunders reveals to Reuven that he knows about Danny's visits to
   the library and wants to know what Danny is reading. He adds that he
   knows he cannot prevent Danny from pursuing knowledge, but that he
   fears his son will lose his Orthodox faith. Reuven immediately tells
   Danny about the talk, and later, Reuven's father discerns that Reb
   Saunders used his conversation with Reuven to communicate with Danny
   indirectly.

   The coming year is dominated by the Allied victory in World War Two,
   and the death of Franklin Roosevelt, which brings grief to the Malters.
   In addition, news of the Holocaust reaches American soil, which sends
   all the characters, especially Rabbi Saunders, into a state of
   depression. During the summer of that year, Reuven's father suffers a
   heart attack, and Reuven goes to stay in the Saunders home. At one
   meal, Reuven mentions that some feel it is time to establish a Jewish
   state, which sends Rabbi Saunders into a fierce tirade against Zionism:
   for the ultra-orthodox, a secular Jewish state established by man
   without the coming of the Messiah is against God's will.

   The next year Danny and Reuven enter college at the Samson Raphael
   Hirsch College and Seminary. Danny is miserable because the psychology
   department at the university is only experimental psychology and not
   analytical. Eventually, Danny's psychology professor tells him that he
   should go into clinical psychology.

   Later in the year, Reuven's father gives a speech at a Zionist rally,
   which is covered by the Orthodox press, and leads Rabbi Saunders to
   forbid Danny to have any contact with Reuven. Reuven does not cope well
   without his best friend and his grades begin to suffer. Soon afterward
   Reuven's father has a second heart attack followed by a lengthy
   hospitalization. Reuven copes with his father's absence by studying the
   Talmud with greater intensity, eventually mastering a very complicated
   section of the Talmud.

   After two years, just as the violence in Palestine comes to an end (the
   1948-49 Arab-Israeli war) and Reuven's father has recovered from his
   heart attack, Danny is allowed to resume his friendship with Reuven
   because the Jewish state is now a fact, and no longer a point of
   dissension.

   As the years pass, Danny's father continues to remain silent with
   Danny. Danny reveals to Reuven that he will not take his father's
   place. Instead, he will apply to graduate school and pursue a doctorate
   in clinical psychology, and his younger brother, Levi, will assume the
   tzaddikate. Danny applies to Harvard, Columbia, and Berkeley. He is
   accepted into all three universities, but cannot understand why his
   father does not speak to him about it, because the acceptance letters
   came by mail and were surely seen.

   On the first day of Passover in Danny and Reuven's senior year of
   college, Reb Saunders invites Reuven to their home to talk with him and
   Danny. Reb Saunders tells Reuven that he knows that Danny will not be
   assuming the rabbinate, that he has known for a long time, and he
   accepts it. He then explains why he raised Danny in silence: he feared
   that Danny's phenomenal intelligence would lead him to lack compassion
   for others. Therefore, he raised Danny in silence so that he could
   learn what it is to suffer, and therefore, have a soul. He also relates
   Danny to his older brother, who ran away from his homeland in Russia
   and became a secular professor and died in Auschwitz.

   Reb Saunders expresses his gratitude to Reuven and his father for
   helping Danny at the point where he was ready to rebel, to help Danny
   remain a part of the Orthodox Jewish tradition, even if he cannot
   assume the rabbi role. To his father's questions, Danny indicates that
   he will remove some of the visible indicators of Hasidism (his full
   beard and earlocks) but will remain an observer of the commandments.
   Reb Saunders says that Passover is the holiday of freedom and that he
   must let Danny be free.

   That September, on his way to graduate school at Columbia, Danny comes
   for a brief visit without his beard and earlocks. He says that he and
   his father now talk.
