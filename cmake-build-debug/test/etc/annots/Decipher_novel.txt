   Set in the year 2012, a series of seemingly unrelated events take
   place, which during the course of the story all become interconnected.

   In Antarctica, an oil drilling venture is taking place by fictitious
   oil company Rola Corp. It is an unstable time in the region because the
   US and China are at loggerheads over mineral and oil rights, and the
   geopolitical landscape is dicey. The drill ship does not strike oil,
   but does discover a very hard form of diamond which turns out to be
   Carbon 60. Not only that, but the samples they retrieve have
   hieroglyphic writing on them.

   Meanwhile, the US military has been monitoring unusually high solar
   flare activity and are worried about its effect on their fleet of
   satellites. While observing Chinese military maneuvers in Antarctica,
   the spy satellite picks up a highly unusual energy signal emanating
   from two miles beneath Antarctica's ice sheet.

   When the US military and Rola Corp. pool their resources it is
   discovered that not only is the diamond-type material reactive to the
   sun, but the time of the energy pulses under the ice in Antarctica,
   match the timing of flare activity from the Sun.

   A team of scientists are assembled to unravel the mystery. From Richard
   Scott, a linguistic Anthropologist, to Jon Hackett a Complexity
   Physicist. The team soon discover that the same energy signature from
   Antarctica is being detected by satellites from ancient monuments all
   over the Earth. From the Amazon jungle to Egypt and China. Inspired by
   stories of the ancient flood of Noah, Scott embarks on the mammoth task
   of deciphering the mysterious language found on the material, and
   comparing what it has to say with the ancient myths and legends of
   floods from all around the world.

   The myths all have similar themes. They talk about the Sun, the
   destructive power coming from the sky, a flood, and a mythical lost
   city, known more famously as Atlantis. More than that, the myths talk
   of the cyclical nature of this destruction and point to an event that
   happened 12,000 years ago that may well be happening all over again.

   The story climaxes with the discovery of Atlantis under the ice in
   Antarctica and the team's expedition to reach it and find any crumb of
   help that may save the Earth from the impending disaster that the Sun
   is about to unleash as it reaches the maximum in its cycle.
