   Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth is a collection of stories
   and essays by J. R. R. Tolkien that were never completed during his
   lifetime, but were edited by his son Christopher Tolkien and published
   in 1980. Many of the tales within are retold in The Silmarillion,
   albeit in modified forms; the work also contains a summary of the
   events of The Lord of the Rings told from a less personal perspective.
