   Another accident in Professor Bulfinch's laboratory, instigated by
   Danny, results in the creation of a transparent, resilient material.
   The material proves useful in creating a bathysphere, and Professor
   Bulfinch, along with his friend Dr. Grimes, Danny, Joe, and Irene,
   descend into the Pacific Ocean on an experimental voyage.
   Unfortunately, the bathysphere's pilot is rendered unconscious, and the
   bathysphere becomes trapped in a cave. On their journey, the submarine
   is examined by a giant squid and attacked by a large shark.
