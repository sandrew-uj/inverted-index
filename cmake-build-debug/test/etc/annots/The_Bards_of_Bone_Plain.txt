   The book is set in a culture reminiscent of the medieval era, but
   technologically near-modern, and in which archaeology is also an
   established profession. Scholar Phelan Cle of the Bardic School at
   Caerau chooses as his graduate thesis the subject of the perhaps
   mythical Bone Plain, where all poetry is said to have originated, and
   the tale of the wandering bard Nairn.

   Meanwhile, archaeologist Jonah Cle, Phelan's alcoholic father, pursues
   his own investigations, urged on by his dedicated disciple Princess
   Beatrice, the king's youngest daughter. At the standing stones near the
   school is unearthed a strange artifact, a disk marked with ancient
   runes that may prove key to the mysteries of Bone Plain. Beatrice soon
   discovers indications of the lost language it represents everywhere.

   Alternating chapters recount the activities of the Cles and the
   princess and the legend of Nairn, and gradually the present and past
   are revealed to mirror each other and ultimately fuse.
