   The book opens with Becky living with her boyfriend Luke in Manhattan's
   West Village. She has finally found her career calling as a personal
   shopper at Barney's and is happily helping her best friend, Suze plan
   her wedding. Becky's best friend, Danny, helps her make a bridesmaid's
   dress. That night, Luke, Danny and Becky discuss when Becky will get
   married. She replies that she will get married in ten years, much to
   Luke's disbelief and amusement. A few days before the wedding, Becky
   learns that Suze is pregnant. Becky is shocked when she catches Suze's
   bouquet and finds a marriage proposal from Luke in it.

   Suddenly, she finds herself caught in the middle between her mother and
   Luke's mother Elinor, both of whom want to throw her a lavish wedding,
   one at her childhood home in England and one at the Plaza Hotel in New
   York on the same day. On one hand, Becky wanted to get married at home.
   On the other, she wanted to have a gorgeous wedding at the Plaza, and
   being the 'special, glossy' person for the day. As she sees more and
   more preparations done on both sides, it's even more difficult for her
   to say no to either one. If Becky gives up the Plaza, she'll have to
   pay a penalty of a hundred thousand. Becky has no way of paying - and
   she can't possibly ask Luke or else he will get suspicious. During that
   time, she confronts Elinor for her own behavior in the way she treated
   him all his life. This in turn made her despise Becky for calling her
   out about that and reveals that she thinks Becky isn't good enough for
   Luke. Refusing to back down, Becky decides to bargain with Elinor about
   having her wedding at the Plaza in exchange that she writes down her
   confession in everything that she did including abandoning Luke and
   take responsibility for herself.

   Meanwhile, Laurel, Becky's favorite customer at Barney's, is devastated
   about her ex-husband, Bill's, much younger girlfriend, Amy Forrester.
   Laurel tells Becky that she suspects Bill has been stealing some of her
   jewelry, including an antique emerald pendant her grandmother gave her
   and has been giving them to Amy in order to humiliate her. When Becky
   catches him in action stealing another one of Laurel's prized jewelry,
   she confronts both Bill and Amy for their actions. She tells them of
   her intentions to notify the authorities and press charges on Laurel's
   behalf unless they reimburse her by returning her jewelry at once.
   After Becky helps Laurel get all of her jewelry back, Laurel promises
   she will help Becky with anything she wants as a wedding gift.

   In the end, Becky finds a great idea - first attend the Plaza wedding
   and feign marriage to satisfy Elinor. Then she and Luke takes a private
   jet provided by Laurel's company to England and really get married at
   Becky's home. At the end of the novel, Becky reveals to Luke that she
   had cashed in their New York wedding gifts and booked two first-class
   around-the-world tickets for their honeymoon. She also mentions that
   she has also helped Michael find a woman who loves him as he is and
   even helped Danny's fashion career.
