   Lacking technology that would enable faster-than-light, or "FTL,
   travel, colonization is accomplished by taking advantage of transient
   but predictable, naturally occurring wormholes in space which allow
   travelers to traverse vast distances. Without warning, a previously
   unknown alien species, the "Chigs", attack and destroy Earth's first
   extra-solar colony and then destroy a second colony ship. The bulk of
   the Earth military forces sent to confront the Chigs are destroyed or
   outflanked, in part because the Chigs have some form of FTL, affording
   them greater freedom of movement (although this technology appears
   limited, and the Chigs also primarily utilize natural wormholes).

   At the opening of the series, the Chigs have defeated all
   counterattacks, and have entered the Solar System. In desperation,
   unproven and under-trained outfits like the 58th "Wildcards" are thrown
   against the Chigs. The Wildcards are the central focus of the series,
   which follows them as they grow from untried cadets into veterans.
   Although the unified Earth forces come under the control of a reformed
   United Nations, the UN has no formal armed forces of its own and
   therefore navies such as the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy operate
   interstellar starships.

   Prior to the events of the show, there was a war between humans and
   androids known as Silicates. These human-looking androids, referred to
   as "walking personal computers", have rebelled, formed their own
   societies, and wage a guerrilla war against human society from a number
   of remote bases. The Silicates are also suspected of having some
   involvement with the Chigs.

   In an attempt to defeat the Silicates, a new underclass of genetically
   engineered and artificially gestated humans were bred to quickly swell
   the ranks of the military. These troops, collectively known as In
   Vitroes or sometimes, derogatorily, "tanks" or "nipple-necks", are born
   at the physical age of 18, and trained solely for combat. In the
   post-war period the tanks have attempted (with mixed success) to
   re-enter human society.
