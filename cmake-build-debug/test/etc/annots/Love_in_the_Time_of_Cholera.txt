   The main characters of the novel are Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza.
   Florentino and Fermina fall in love in their youth. A secret
   relationship blossoms between the two with the help of Fermina's Aunt
   Escolastica. They exchange love letters. But once Fermina's father,
   Lorenzo Daza, finds out about the two, he forces his daughter to stop
   seeing Florentino immediately. When she refuses, he and his daughter
   move in with his deceased wife's family in another city. Regardless of
   the distance, Fermina and Florentino continue to communicate via
   telegraph. Upon her return, Fermina realizes that her relationship with
   Florentino was nothing but a dream since they are practically
   strangers; she breaks off her engagement to Florentino and returns all
   his letters.

   A young and accomplished national hero, Dr. Juvenal Urbino, meets
   Fermina and begins to court her. Despite her initial dislike of Urbino,
   Fermina gives in to her father's persuasion and the security and wealth
   Urbino offers, and they wed. Urbino is a physician devoted to science,
   modernity, and "order and progress". He is committed to the eradication
   of cholera and to the promotion of public works. He is a rational man
   whose life is organized precisely and who greatly values his importance
   and reputation in society. He is a herald of progress and
   modernization.

   Even after Fermina's engagement and marriage, Florentino swore to stay
   faithful and wait for her; but his promiscuity gets the better of him
   and he has hundreds of affairs. Even with all the women he is with, he
   makes sure that Fermina will never find out. Meanwhile, Fermina and
   Urbino grow old together, going through happy years and unhappy ones
   and experiencing all the reality of marriage. Urbino proves in the end
   not to have been an entirely faithful husband, confessing one affair to
   Fermina many years into their marriage. Though the novel seems to
   suggest that Urbino's love for Fermina was never as spiritually chaste
   as Florentino's was, it also complicates Florentino's devotion by
   cataloging his many trysts as well as a few potentially genuine loves.

   As an elderly man, Urbino attempts to get his pet parrot out of his
   mango tree, only to fall off the ladder he was standing on and die.
   After the funeral Florentino proclaims his love for Fermina once again
   and tells her he has stayed faithful to her all these years. Hesitant
   at first because she is only recently widowed, and finding his advances
   untoward, Fermina comes to recognize Florentino's wisdom and maturity,
   eventually gives him a second chance, and their love is allowed to
   blossom during their old age. They attempt a life together, having
   lived two lives separately for over five decades.
