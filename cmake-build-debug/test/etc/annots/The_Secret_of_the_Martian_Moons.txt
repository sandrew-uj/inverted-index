   Returning to Mars from a four-year stay on Earth, sixteen-year-old
   Nelson Parr feels anger toward all the talk he hears about the
   possibility of the Earth authorities shutting down the Martian colony
   and bringing all of the colonists back to Earth. For a century the
   colonists had tried to make a living on Mars and, more importantly, to
   unlock the secrets of the abandoned cities that they found on the
   planet and now some people just wanted to give up. He's distracted from
   his anger when he's attacked by an intruder in his sleep cubicle. The
   assailant gets away but leaves behind, on the mirror over the wash
   basin, the evaporating print of a three-fingered hand. Nelson assumes
   that the burglar was looking for the letter that Leroy Perrault, a
   scientist with the Interplanetary Bureau, had given to him to pass on
   to his father, John Carson Parr.

   After arriving on Mars Nelson learns from his father that the planet is
   indeed being abandoned and over the next few days the remaining three
   hundred colonists are put on ships and sent to Earth. But Nelson, his
   father, his father's assistant (Jim Worden), and three other men
   secretly stay behind. Perrault's letter has authorized this clandestine
   group because certain anomalous events noticed over the previous
   century indicate that the Martians are still present, hiding in their
   impenetrably sealed cities. To catch out the hidden Martians the six
   men ride a small rocketship to Phobos, the larger and innermore of
   Mars's moons, and set up camp with their telescopes.

   Weeks go by, but then Nelson sees a light in one of the cities. Over
   the following days the men see more signs of activity in the city and
   one day they see a collection of crates lying in a plaza. To keep a
   longer watch on the crates Nelson and Jim take their rocketship's
   lifeboat to Deimos and set up the spare telescope some distance from
   their landing site. Jim goes back to the lifeboat to get the
   telescope's other lens and when he doesn't come back after some time
   Nelson goes to see what's taking him so long. He finds that Jim has
   been murdered: someone bashed in the back of Jim's helmet to let the
   air out of his spacesuit and then sabotaged the lifeboat and its radio.

   Trying to spot the murderers while at the same time evading them,
   Nelson crosses the surface of Deimos in long, gliding bounds, hoping,
   in some desperation, to find the killers' spaceship and somehow take
   it. Feeling that he's being followed, he hides in a small, narrow
   canyon and, believing he's under active pursuit, goes to its dead end
   and takes refuge in a cave that ends at a door. He hides in a side
   tunnel and watches five humanoid aliens come to the door, open it, and
   pass through. A few minutes later he goes through the door, through the
   airlock beyond, and into a large alien base under the surface of
   Deimos.

   As he's exploring the base he's confronted by one of the three-fingered
   aliens, who introduces himself as Kunosh, the leader of the Deimosians.
   Hearing of Jim Worden's murder, the timid Kunosh enlists Nelson's help
   in ridding Deimos of certain bad men who, Kunosh assures Nelson, killed
   his friend. In the control room of the hollow moon Nelson knocks out
   the five aliens who he believes killed Jim, enabling Kunosh's people to
   tie them up. Then he finds out that the five came from Phobos, where
   his father and three other men are at risk.

   In response to Nelson's demand and the taunts of one of the Phobosians,
   Kunosh tells Nelson that his people, both Deimosians and Phobosians,
   are not Martians. These aliens had originated on a planet revolving
   around the star Vega, where they had evolved a perfect society with a
   perfect culture. They want nothing to do with alien cultures, which
   they regard as absolutely inferior to theirs. But then they learned
   that the Marauders, an immense horde of interstellar pirates in a vast
   armada of huge, black ships, were headed their way. They responded by
   building two giant, spherical spaceships, loading their entire
   population into them, and fleeing into interstellar space for a three
   thousand-year journey to Sol, where they arrived and went into orbit
   around Mars sometime in the 1600s.

   Suddenly realizing that the Phobosian spaceship must still be
   available, Nelson coerces Kunosh into taking him to it. They arrive in
   the hangar just in time to see the five Phobosians that Nelson helped
   capture boarding the craft and leaving Deimos in it. Returning to the
   Deimos control room, Nelson is put into television contact with the
   Phobos control room and the leaders there. The Phobosian leader demands
   that the Deimosians capture Nelson so that his men can pick him up and
   bring him to Phobos, where the Deimosians cannot secretly murder him as
   they did Jim Worden. Before the Deimosians can act panic breaks out -
   the lead elements of the Marauder fleet have been detected crossing the
   orbit of Pluto.

   In the panic Nelson drags Kunosh back to the spaceship hangar and
   compels him to explain the controls of a cube-shaped vehicle. Once
   alone he lifts the ship off Deimos, which has thrust itself out of its
   orbit to head into interstellar space, where it will never be found.
   Phobos has also left its orbit and is headed toward Earth. Trying to
   keep up, Nelson is captured by the Marauders.

   It turns out that the Marauders are the Martians, descendants of people
   taken from Earth to Mars half a million years ago by unknown visitors
   from the stars. Having learned the technology and techniques of
   interstellar flight, they tell Nelson, they pack up their entire
   population every ten generations or so, seal their cities, and take off
   on a millennia-long interstellar road trip. They have just returned
   from their latest adventure and find that they must now prevent a war
   with Earth. A single fast cruiser takes Nelson to Earth, lands at the
   Capitol, and Nelson and the Martian representatives convince Earth
   authorities that peace is best.
