   territory.

   In a post-apocalyptic setting, mankind is reduced to small settlements
   whose main business is to produce electric power. With fossil and
   nuclear fuel sources mostly depleted, the communities are dependent on
   naturally created electricity, be it by air, water, or muscle power
   (the latter of which is used as a punishment for criminals and other
   undesirables of this society). Under the motto "All in service to all"
   everyone must contribute to society's welfare.

   Electric City is actually a collective name for several geographically
   separated precincts. Central cultural and social administration takes
   place at Central Stations. Other precincts include:
     * Nerima, the site of Electric City's water purification facilities
       and of the Camera Obscura observatory, the meeting place of the
       "knitting society".
     * Greenlight, where the city's first university is located.
     * Morningside, the most modern precinct and residential area.
     * The Mines, a mining and manufacturing district.
     * The Agricultural Territories, the main food provider for the city.
     * The Outside, an unsettled off-limits territory lining the coast
       near Electric City, which is inhabited by fugitives from the
       persecution by the "knitting society".

   The precincts' main connection is by their power cables and a wired
   radio service, but free communication, trading, and traveling has been
   made illegal, since it entails the wasting of precious electrical power
   reserves as well as the gradual loss of influence for the "knitting
   society", a matriarchal group of war survivors who founded Electric
   City and are ruthlessly trying to maintain their power base. The Tap
   Coders, an underground movement of free-thinkers trying to circumvent
   the current social restrictions by establishing an illegal
   communications network, especially present a considerable thorn which
   they seek to eliminate.
