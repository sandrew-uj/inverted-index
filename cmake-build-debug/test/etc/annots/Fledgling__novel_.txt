   The novel tells the story of Shori, a 53-year-old member of the Ina
   species, who appears to be a ten-year-old African-American girl. The
   Ina are nocturnal, long-lived, and derive sustenance by drinking human
   blood. Though they are physically superior to humans, both in strength
   and ability to heal from injury, the Ina depend on humans to survive.
   Therefore, their relationships are symbiotic, with the Ina's venom
   providing significant boost to their humans' immune systems and
   extending their lives up to 200 years. However, withdrawal from this
   venom will also lead to the human's death.

   The story opens as Shori awakens with no knowledge of who or where she
   is, in a cave and suffering from critical injuries. Although she is
   burned and has skull trauma, she kills and eats the first creature that
   approaches her. Eating this creature allows her to heal quickly enough
   to walk and explore on her own. She runs into the ruins where a
   construction worker named Wright picks her up on the side of the road;
   Shori bites Wright because she finds his scent irresistible, and they
   begin their relationship.

   While staying at Wright's uncle's cabin, Shori realizes she's in need
   of more blood, so she feeds on other inhabitants in the town and
   develops a relationship with an older woman named Theodora. Shori and
   Wright return to the burned-out, abandoned village near where she woke
   up to learn more about her past. They eventually meet Iosif, Shori's
   father, who tells her the burned-out town was once her home where she
   had lived with her mother and sisters. They also learn that Wright and
   Shori's mutually beneficial relationship makes Wright Shori's symbiont.
   Further, Shori's dark skin is the result of a genetic modification: the
   Ina were experimenting to make their kind resistant to daylight. All
   other Ina are white-skinned.

   Later, before Shori is able to move in with Iosif, his settlement is
   burned down as Shori's home was. Shori and Wright meet the only two
   human symbionts who survived, Celia and Brook. Shori adopts Celia and
   Brook as her own symbionts to save their lives. Their bonding is
   initially uncomfortable for all of them, however, as symbionts become
   addicted to the venom of one particular Ina. The four flee to another
   house that Iosif owns. While at this new house during the day, they are
   attacked by several men with gasoline and guns. Because of the genetic
   enhancements made on Shori, she is awake and they are able to escape.

   The group travels to the settlement of the Gordon family (old friends
   of Iosif), where they are welcomed and guarded by human symbionts
   during the day. The attackers also raid the settlement, but Shori and
   the human symbionts are able to fight back. They capture three
   attackers alive. The Gordon family interrogates the intruders and finds
   that they are the same attackers who killed Shori's parents and have
   been sent by the Silks, another Ina family. The Gordons suspect the
   attacks on Shori are motivated by disdain for the genetic
   experimentation that created her.

   After failing to get a confession from the Silks, the Gordon family
   calls a Council of Judgment on Shori's behalf. Thirteen Ina families
   and their symbionts come to the Gordon settlement to discuss the Silks'
   attack on Shore. During the Council, the Silk representative, Katharine
   Dahlman, sends one of her symbionts to kill Theodora, Shori's symbiont.
   This attack succeeds. Thus, in addition to issuing a punishment upon
   the Silks, the Council must also punish Katharine Dahlman. The Silks'
   sons are taken from them to be adopted by other Ina families, ensuring
   that the Silk line will die out. Katharine Dahlman is sentenced to have
   her legs amputated. She refuses this punishment and attempts to kill
   Shori, who fights back and fatally wounds her. Katharine is killed by
   being decapitated and burned. After regaining consciousness, Shori
   decides to join the Brathwaite family and learn the ways of the Ina to
   create her own family.
