   The story is set in 2010, mostly in the United States. A number of
   plots and many vignettes are played out in this future world, based on
   Brunner's extrapolation of social, economic, and technological trends.
   The key main trends are based on the enormous population and its
   impact: social stresses, eugenic legislation, widening social
   divisions, future shock and extremism. Certain of Brunner's guesses are
   fairly close, others not, and some ideas clearly show their 1960s
   mindset.

   Many futuristic concepts, products and services, and slang are
   presented. A supercomputer named Shalmaneser is an essential plot
   element. The Hipcrime Vocab and other works by the fictional
   sociologist Chad C. Mulligan are frequent sources of quotations. Some
   examples of slang include "codder" (man), "shiggy" (woman),
   "whereinole" (where in hell?), "prowlie" (an armoured police car),
   "offyourass" (possessing an attitude), "bivving" (bisexuality, from
   "ambivalent") and "mucker" (a person running amok). A new technology
   introduced is "eptification" (education for particular tasks), a form
   of mental programming. Another is a kind of interactive television that
   shows the viewer as part of the program ("Mr. & Mrs. Everywhere").
   Genetically modified microorganisms are used as terrorist weapons.

   The book centres on two New York men, Donald Hogan and Norman Niblock
   House, who share an apartment.^[2] House is a rising executive at
   General Technics, one of the all-powerful corporations. Using his
   "Afram" (African American) heritage to advance his position, he has
   risen to vice-president at age twenty-six.

   Hogan is introduced with a single paragraph rising out of nowhere:
   "Donald Hogan is a spy". Donald shares an apartment with House and is
   undercover as a student. Hogan's real work is as a "synthesist",
   although he is a commissioned officer and can be called up for active
   duty.

   The two main plots concern the fictional African state of Beninia (a
   name reminiscent of the real-life Benin, though that nation in the
   Bight of Benin was known as the Republic of Dahomey when the book was
   written) making a deal with General Technics to take over the
   management of their country, in a bid to speed up development from
   third world to first world status. A second major plot is a
   break-through in genetic engineering in the fictional South East Asian
   nation of Yatakang (an island nation and a former Dutch colony, like
   Indonesia), to which Hogan is soon sent by the US Government ("State")
   to investigate. The two plots eventually cross, bringing potential
   implications for the entire world.
