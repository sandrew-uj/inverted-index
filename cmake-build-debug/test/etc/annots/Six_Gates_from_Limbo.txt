   On awakening in an idyllic tropical paradise, Rex is disoriented and
   possibly afflicted with amnesia. He knows his name, but the particulars
   are curiously missing. He spends his first week exploring, and
   discovers that his Eden-like paradise is surrounded by a huge
   unscalable wall 50 miles in circumference. Furthermore, there are six
   gateways at roughly equal intervals, but there is no way to climb up
   there and see where they go.

   After a significant amount of exploring, he finds a single house that
   may hold the answers to his missing memory. How he could have missed it
   on first waking, is beyond him. Maybe he was just pointed in the wrong
   direction, and he started wandering off randomly, and forgot to turn
   around. Inside, he discovers what appears to be three suspended
   animation tanks, one of which is labeled REX, another REGINA - both
   with their tops off - and on looking inside, mysteriously vacant. The
   other tank is labeled VENUS and holds a woman who is the most
   breathtakingly beautiful thing he has ever seen.
