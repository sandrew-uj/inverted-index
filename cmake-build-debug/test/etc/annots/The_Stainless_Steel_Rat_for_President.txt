   The Stainless Steel Rat for President is a novel in which Slippery Jim
   DiGriz and his family clean up the world of Paraiso-Aqui.^[1]

   After realizing that a planetary dictator is rigging elections, the rat
   decides to run to ouster him by running as a competing candidate. As
   his Vice President, he chooses a fair man who should have been
   president if not for the corruption. Since the entire media, military,
   and political establishment is on the side of the dictator, DiGriz has
   few tools at his disposal. He uses political judo on his opponent.
   After deliberately angering the dictator into creating a blowout
   political election, DiGriz conducts a live interview in a precinct
   where 100% of the vote went to the incumbent. He then asks each
   villager to publicly state who they voted for and they all say DeGriz.
   This is clear evidence that fraud was committed which forces a redo of
   the election with better balloting controls. After winning the fair
   election, DiGriz allows himself to be (fake) assassinated so that the
   Vice President can take over.^[2]
