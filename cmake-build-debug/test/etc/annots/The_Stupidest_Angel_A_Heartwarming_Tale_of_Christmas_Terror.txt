   An angel named Raziel (previously in Moore's novel Lamb) is sent to
   Earth to grant the wish of a child; he decides to help a boy who had
   witnessed the death of a man dressed as Santa Claus. Meanwhile, the
   town is preparing for a community dinner-gathering at the local church,
   near the cemetery. In his inept attempt to bring "Santa" back to life,
   the angel causes the townspeople to fall under siege by brain-hungry
   zombies who arise from their burial plots.
