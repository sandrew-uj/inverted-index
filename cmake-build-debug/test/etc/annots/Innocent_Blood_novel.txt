   A young woman, Philippa Palfrey, has always known that she was adopted.
   Her adoptive father, Maurice, is a university lecturer and television
   personality. He is also a spokesperson for the Young Socialists party
   and a writer of textbooks on sociology. Philippa's adoptive mother,
   Hilda, is a magistrate with a local juvenile court and an amateur cook.
   At the age of 8 years old, Philippa suppresses memories of her
   biological parents and in the intervening years, creates an idealised
   version of her parents. When she attains majority, Philippa conducts a
   rudimentary investigation of her biological parents and discovers the
   truth: her biological parents were convicted ten years ago for the rape
   and murder of a young girl, Julie Scase, which caused her to be put up
   for foster care and eventual adoption by the Palfreys. She discovers
   her father died in prison a few years after the conviction and her
   birth mother is still alive, due to be released after 10 years in an
   English women's prison. She returns home after the discovery and
   confronts Hilda, who is shocked and dismayed to learn the adoption
   order was unsealed. It is after a strained dinner party with three
   guests where Philippa places her adoptive family in a position where
   the elder Palfreys have a contentious argument with Philippa. When her
   mother, Mary Ducton, is released from prison, Philippa looks her up,
   decides to live with her in a small flat in London and try to recreate
   the mother-daughter relationship. They rent a small flat in Central
   London and have a menial job at a fish and chip shop to supplement
   Philippa's meagre savings.

   Mary Ducton provides Philippa with an account of the murder/rape and a
   bit of background information on the rapist, Martin. It is revealed
   later that the account was written recently, presumably for Philippa's
   benefit.

   Norman Scase, the father of the murder victim, has sworn vengeance and
   prepares to track down Mary and kill her as had been the dying wish of
   Julie's mother and Scase's wife. With the help of a private
   investigator, Norman Scase discovers the date and time of the
   murderess's release from her prison in York and follows her and
   Philippa back to London. He loses them in the London underground and
   therefore undertakes a surveillance of the Palfrey residence, in the
   hope that one of her adoptive parents will lead him to Philippa and
   thus to the woman he intends to kill.

   The novel reaches its climactic ending when Scase breaks into the flat
   only to find that Mary Ducton has already committed suicide. He
   nonetheless stabs her already dead body. Philippa orders him out and
   she takes the blame for the stabbing. She then rings Maurice, who
   arrives quickly on the scene, calls the police and at the same time
   ensures that Philippa is not charged with any crime or misdemeanour. In
   an epilogue chapter Philippa meets Norman Scase after a service in the
   chapel of King's College, Cambridge, where she is a student. It emerges
   that she has published a book under her new name, Philippa Ducton, and
   also that Norman has found love with Violet, the blind helper at the
   hotel where he stayed when he was spying on Philippa's adoptive mother.
