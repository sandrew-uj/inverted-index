   The first man to pass close to Mars is driven insane by strange
   'voices' he hears on his radio. He is unable to record the voices as
   the Van Allen radiation belts wipe the magnetic tapes clean, so doubt
   is cast on his account. U.N.E.X.A. (United Nations Exploration Agency)
   send their crack team (Chris Godfrey, Serge Smyslov, Morrey Kant and
   Tony Hale) to investigate. After landing on the planet's surface they
   find traces of an ancient civilization, but then a disembodied Martian
   appears and demands its people be transported to Earth, where they will
   enslave the human race. One-by-one the crew are taken over.

   This novel introduces the concept of the Ion drive, allowing continuous
   acceleration of one-fifth g.
