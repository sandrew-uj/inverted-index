   Lord of Light is set on a planet colonized by some of the remnants of
   "vanished Urath", or Earth. The crew and colonists from the spaceship
   Star of India found themselves on a strange planet surrounded by
   hostile indigenous races and had to carve a place for themselves or
   perish. To increase their chances of survival, the crew has used
   chemical treatments, biofeedback and electronics to mutate their minds
   and create enhanced self-images, or "Aspects", that "strengthened their
   bodies and intensified their wills and extended the power of their
   desires into Attributes, which fell with a force like magic upon those
   against whom they were turned." The crew has also developed a
   technology to transfer a person's atman, or soul, electronically to a
   new body. This reincarnation by mind transfer has created a race of
   potential immortals and allowed the former crew members to institute
   the Hindu caste system, with themselves at the top.

   The novel covers great spans of time. Eventually, the crew used their
   now-great powers to subjugate or destroy the native non-human races
   (whom they characterize as demons) while setting themselves up as gods
   in the eyes of the many generations of colonist progeny. Taking on the
   powers and names of Hindu deities, these "gods" maintain respect and
   control of the masses by maintaining a stranglehold on the access to
   reincarnation and by suppressing any technological advancements beyond
   a medieval level. The gods fear that any enlightenment or advancement
   might lead to a technological renaissance that would eventually weaken
   their power.

   The protagonist, Sam, who has developed the ability to manipulate
   electromagnetic forces, is a renegade crewman who has rejected godhood,
   taking for himself the role of Siddhartha Gautama/Buddha. Sam is the
   last "Accelerationist": He believes that technology should be available
   to the masses, and that reincarnation should not be controlled by the
   elite. Sam introduces Buddhism as a culture jamming tool and strives to
   cripple the power of the gods with this "new" religion. His carefully
   planned revolt against the gods takes place in stages: "An army, great
   in space, may offer opposition in a brief span of time. One man, brief
   in space, must spread his opposition across a period of many years if
   he is to have a chance of succeeding."
