   Roadside Picnic is a work of fiction based on the aftermath of an
   extraterrestrial event called the Visitation that simultaneously took
   place in half a dozen separate locations around Earth over a two-day
   period. Neither the Visitors themselves nor their means of arrival or
   departure were ever seen by the local populations who lived inside the
   relatively small areas, each a few square kilometers, of the six
   Visitation Zones. The zones exhibit strange and dangerous phenomena not
   understood by humans, and contain artifacts with inexplicable,
   seemingly supernatural properties. The title of the novel derives from
   an analogy proposed by the character Dr. Valentine Pilman, who compares
   the Visitation to a picnic:

     A picnic. Picture a forest, a country road, a meadow. Cars drive off
     the country road into the meadow, a group of young people get out
     carrying bottles, baskets of food, transistor radios, and cameras.
     They light fires, pitch tents, turn on the music. In the morning
     they leave. The animals, birds, and insects that watched in horror
     through the long night creep out from their hiding places. And what
     do they see? Old spark plugs and old filters strewn around... Rags,
     burnt-out bulbs, and a monkey wrench left behind... And of course,
     the usual mess--apple cores, candy wrappers, charred remains of the
     campfire, cans, bottles, somebody's handkerchief, somebody's
     penknife, torn newspapers, coins, faded flowers picked in another
     meadow.^[2]

   In this analogy, the nervous animals are the humans who venture forth
   after the Visitors have left, discovering items and anomalies that are
   ordinary to those who have discarded them, but incomprehensible or
   deadly to those who find them.

   This explanation implies that the Visitors may not have paid any
   attention to, or even noticed, the human inhabitants of the planet
   during their visit, just as humans do not notice or pay attention to
   grasshoppers or ladybugs during a picnic. The artifacts and phenomena
   left behind by the Visitors in the Zones were garbage, discarded and
   forgotten, without any preconceived plan to advance or damage humanity.
   There is little chance that the Visitors will return again because for
   them it was a brief stop, for reasons unknown, on the way to their
   actual destination.
