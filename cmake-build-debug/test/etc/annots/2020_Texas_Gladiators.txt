   After bitter wars and natural disasters, the earth is devastated,
   depopulated and chaotic; morality and law no longer exist. Marauding
   gangs terrorize the last gatherings of peace-loving people, who often
   gather around churches. Only a small group of volunteers - the Rangers
   - fight back against injustice.

   In Texas in 2020, degenerate villains raid a monastery in which pretty
   Maida took refuge, when five roving Rangers show up. The
   battle-hardened men quickly succeed in repelling the attackers and
   restoring order. However, during the incident, one of her saviors named
   Catch Dog falls into disgrace as he tries to rape Maida. He is
   eventually rejected by his comrades. Later, Ranger Nexus separates from
   his friends, taking Maida with him.

   Five years later, Nexus and Maida live with their little daughter a
   seemingly safe life in the settlement of Free Town. In addition to
   basic services, the community operates a power plant and uranium mine.
   The village's energy reserves soon lure in dark outlaws. One day,
   disaster strikes as Catch Dog manages to bring down Free Town with his
   gang. Catch Dog himself acts on behalf of the "Black One", a
   totalitarian ruler who subjugates the population with his thugs. In an
   attempt to resist, Nexus dies. The able-bodied men are enslaved and
   used as laborers in the uranium production, the women are sold to
   different bars in the area.

   At some point, the three remaining Rangers meet Maida and set her free
   from her master, a gambler. The three encounter and manage to enlist
   the help of an indigenous tribe. Ultimately, the Rangers and the
   recruited warriors succeed in taking back Free Town. The regime of
   terror is overthrown. Both Catch Dog and Black One are killed, and in
   the midst of combat, also one of the Ranger succumbs to his injuries.
   In the end, Maida and her daughter can expect a happier future. The two
   remaining Rangers leave.
