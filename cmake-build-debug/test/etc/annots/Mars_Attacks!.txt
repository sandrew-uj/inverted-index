   A spaceship is seen departing from Earth and returning to Mars, where
   it gathers hundreds of other Martian ships and heads back to Earth.
   U.S. President James Dale (Jack Nicholson), along with his aides,
   addresses the United States concerning the historic event. Several days
   later, the President's science aides set up a first contact meeting
   with the Martians in Pahrump, Nevada, as Dale watches the development
   on television with his wife Marsha (Glenn Close) and his daughter Taffy
   (Natalie Portman).

   Using a translation machine, the Ambassador of Mars announces that they
   "come in peace". When a hippy releases a dove as a symbol of peace, the
   Ambassador shoots it before he and the other Martians massacre most of
   the people at the event, including General Casey (Paul Winfield), news
   reporter Jason Stone (Michael J. Fox), and young private Billy-Glenn
   Norris (Jack Black), before capturing chat-show host and Stone's
   co-worker and girlfriend Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her
   pet chihuahua, Poppy.

   Thinking that the Martians assumed that the dove was a symbol of war,
   Dale tells Professor Donald Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) to renegotiate
   with the Martians, whose ambassador later requests to address the U.S.
   Congress. At this meeting, the Martians massacre most of Congress.
   Kessler begs the Martian ambassador to stop, but is knocked unconscious
   and taken aboard their ship, where he is later shown with his body
   dismembered and his disembodied head remaining animated. General Decker
   (Rod Steiger) tries to persuade Dale to retaliate with nuclear warfare,
   but he refuses.

   After a failed attempt to assassinate Dale in which a disguised Martian
   is killed, the Martians invade Earth in droves, starting with
   Washington, D.C. and quickly spreading around the globe. As they attack
   the White House, the U.S. Secret Service evacuates Dale, but Marsha is
   crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier and Taffy is separated
   from them during the chaos. After the President of France is
   assassinated by the Martians that night, the U.S. government attempts a
   nuclear attack on the Martian mothership, but that proves futile and
   the Martians continue destroying Earth and start defacing and
   vandalizing world landmarks. Eventually, the Martian leader and two
   other Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and reduce
   Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill
   everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned
   speech in an attempt to plead for peace and his life. The Martian
   leader appears to be moved by the speech and seemingly agrees to a
   truce with Dale, but then uses a gadget disguised as a hand to kill
   him.

   As the Martians ravage Las Vegas, Byron Williams (Jim Brown), a former
   world champion boxer turned casino employee, leads a small group of
   survivors consisting of Barbara Land (Annette Bening), Tom Jones,
   Byron's co-worker waitress Cindy, and a rude gambling lawyer (Danny
   DeVito) to an airfield in the hope of flying a small jet to safety.
   They barely make it there, losing the lawyer in the process (who was
   killed by a Martian), but discover a large group of Martians (along
   with the ambassador) stationed there as they are preparing to take off.
   Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he
   succeeds in killing the ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed
   by the other Martians, but Tom, Barbara and Cindy manage to escape.

   While going to rescue his grandmother, Florence, Billy-Glenn's brother
   Richie (Lukas Haas) discovers that the Martians' heads explode when
   they hear Slim Whitman's "Indian Love Call". Richie and Florence then
   drive around town, using the song to kill Martians, and broadcast the
   song on a local radio station. Thereafter, armed forces broadcast the
   song around the globe, killing the Martian leader and most, if not all,
   of the other Martians. Nathalie and Kessler's disembodied heads kiss
   while the Martian spaceship they are on crashes into the ocean, killing
   both of them.

   In the aftermath, Barbara, Cindy, and Jones emerge from a cave with
   some wild animals to see dozens of crashed Martian ships in Lake Tahoe.
   Taffy awards Richie and Florence the Medal of Honor. Byron, who
   survived the Martian brawl, arrives in Washington, D.C. to reunite with
   his former wife Louise and their two sons Cedric and Neville as the
   devastation is being cleaned up.
