   Takato Matsuki, a fan of the Digimon card game, finds a Blue Card,
   which transforms his card reader into a D-Power Digivice. His
   original Digimon creation, Guilmon, materializes into real life when
   his D-Power scans his drawings. Takato meets Henry Wong and Rika
   Nonaka, two other children who are partnered with Terriermon and
   Renamon, as well as Calumon and Impmon. As wild Digimon began roaming
   Shinjuku, the Tamers defeat them and defend the city. Using their
   D-Powers, the Tamers can Digi-modify through scanning cards or help
   them Digivolve. After each Digimon is defeated, their Digimon
   obtains their data. Meanwhile, Hypnos, an intelligence agency led by
   Mitsuo Yamaki, has been capturing the Digimon and sending them back to
   the Digital World.

   The Tamers eventually began working with Hypnos when the Devas invade
   the Real World. Calumon is captured by the Devas, and the Tamers follow
   him to the Digital World to save him. When Impmon turns on and attacks
   the Tamers and murders Leomon, Jeri Kato falls into depression. After
   resolving conflicts with the Digimon Sovereigns, the Tamers learn that
   the Digimon are protecting themselves from humans and the Real World
   after the Digital World is invaded by the D-Reaper, a rogue clean-up
   program. As the Tamers return to the Real World, the D-Reaper kidnaps
   Jeri, manipulating and trapping her inside the body. When the D-Reaper
   begins to materialize in the Real World, the Tamers defeat it, using
   the program and saving Jeri. With both worlds restored, the children
   are forced to say goodbye to their Digimon partners, when they end up
   returning to the Digital World by the effects of the program. The
   series ends with Takato discovering the portal in the tunnel under his
   hiding place.
