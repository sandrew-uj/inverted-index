   A cloned Alice wakes up in a mansion, wanders through its halls, and is
   forced to escape several security traps, mirroring some events of the
   first film. During her escape, Alice makes use of new telekinetic
   powers, killing a security guard. However, she is eventually killed by
   a bouncing mine hidden in the floor. Her body is dumped into a pit
   filled with dozens of other Alice clones, representing the failed
   results of the Umbrella Corporation's ongoing Project Alice.

   Following Umbrella's attempts to cover up the contamination of Raccoon
   City, the T-virus spreads around the world, devastating not only the
   human population, but the entire global environment. The real Alice
   wanders the wasteland that was once the Southwestern U.S., and after
   fighting off a family of marauders, discovers information in an
   abandoned notebook referring to an uninfected area in Alaska. Alice
   realizes that she, like her clones, has developed telekinesis.

   Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs, the former head of Project Alice and
   top official at the North American Umbrella facility in Nevada,
   considers Alice's recapture a top priority due to her ability to bond
   with the T-virus without mutating. At a meeting of Umbrella executives,
   Isaacs attempts to persuade Umbrella's board of directors that he can
   use Alice's blood to develop a treatment that will tame the infected
   zombies. Isaacs' plan is dismissed by Umbrella CEO Albert Wesker, who
   orders Isaacs to return to his work with the clones.

   Simultaneously, a convoy of survivors led by Claire Redfield and
   Raccoon City survivors Carlos Oliveira and L.J. Wade travels across the
   country in search of supplies and safe harbor. While searching a motel,
   L.J. is bitten by a zombie. Fearing the harsh fate that awaits him, he
   chooses not to tell the other survivors about the injury. The next
   morning, the convoy is attacked by a murderous flock of infected crows.
   With the team nearly overwhelmed, Alice appears and defeats the
   remaining crows with her newfound telekinesis, though falling
   unconscious. Awaking shortly thereafter, Alice is introduced to Claire
   and tells her about the notebook, convincing her to take the convoy to
   Alaska.

   Isaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected lead to the creation of a
   new zombie breed. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater,
   reports on Isaacs' disregard for Umbrella regulations. Wesker tasks
   Slater with watching Isaacs, telling him to kill the scientist if he
   disobeys orders again. Tracing an energy pattern sent out by Alice's
   telekinesis, Umbrella triangulates her location. Desperate to reclaim
   Alice for the sake of achieving his goals, Dr. Isaacs sends his new
   zombies to ambush the convoy against Wesker's specific orders. During
   the attack, most of the convoy is killed, and L.J. succumbs to his
   infection, biting Carlos. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely,
   but she breaks free from Umbrella's programming and continues to fight.
   She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he is bitten as he flees via
   helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the
   helicopter's flight path, leading them to Umbrella's underground
   facility.

   The convoy approaches Umbrella's facility, which is surrounded by
   thousands of zombies. Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck
   into the zombie mob, blowing the rig apart and giving both Alice and
   Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Following the
   rescue, Alice decides to stay behind. Under Wesker's orders, Slater and
   a group of Umbrella commandos take control of Isaacs' lab, where he's
   injected himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to
   counteract his infection. Slater shoots him, triggering a mutation that
   transforms Isaacs into the monstrous Tyrant. Though he retains his
   intelligence, Isaacs kills Slater along with everyone else in the
   facility, ultimately finding himself trapped in the lab's lower levels.

   Approaching the scene, Alice meets a holograph of the Red Queen's
   "sister" AI, the White Queen. She informs Alice that her blood can cure
   the T-virus, defends the Red Queen's prior actions, and reveals what
   happened to Dr. Isaacs. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice
   encounters one of her clones, which awakens but appears to die from
   shock soon after. Alice discovers Isaacs/Tyrant, defeating him after
   leading him to the replica of The Hive's laser corridor featured in the
   film's opening. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the
   system is deactivated by the clone, who is still alive.

   Later in Tokyo, Wesker informs his fellow Umbrella executives that the
   North American facility has been lost. Alice appears during the
   meeting, declaring that she and her "friends" (the other clones) are
   coming for him.
