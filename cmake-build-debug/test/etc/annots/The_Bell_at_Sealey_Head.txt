   The small ocean town of Sealey Head has long been haunted by a phantom
   bell that tolls as evening falls. The sound is so common that many of
   the town's inhabitants do not even notice it, let alone questions its
   existence. Ridley Dow, a scholar from the city, comes to investigate
   the mystery, and sets up residence at the old inn owned by a young man
   named Judd and his ailing father. To aid Ridley, Judd enlists the help
   of his friend and love-interest Gwyneth, a young woman who writes her
   own stories to explain the bell.

   On the other side of town is the ancient manor Aislinn House, whose
   owner, Lady Eglantine, lies dying. Emma, a servant in the house, is
   able to open doors that lead not into another room, but into another
   world. On the other side of Aislinn House's doors is castle where the
   princess Ysabo moves through her daily rituals, tasks that Ysabo hates
   and does not understand, but cannot question. While Emma and Ysabo are
   able to speak to one another, neither has ever tried to cross into the
   other's realm.

   When Lady Eglantine's heir Miranda Beryl comes to Aislinn House, Sealey
   Head's secrets begin to reveal themselves, sometimes with dangerous
   consequences. Miranda brings to Sealey Head an entourage of friends
   from the city, as well as a strange assistant. As the town gets pulled
   deeper into the strange magic that Ridley, Judd, Gwyneth, and Emma
   uncover, Ridley breaches the border between Aislinn House and Ysabo's
   world. It is only when the bell's location and owner are discovered
   that Aislinn House and all of Sealey Head are able to return to safety.
