   Shaken by the news that her best friend Penelope has gotten engaged to
   Avery, who neither she nor Penelope's other friends think is right for
   her, Bette Robinson suddenly quits her job at UBS, the investment
   banking firm where she has worked in the five years since she and
   Penelope graduated from Emory. However, she does little to find a new
   direction in life until her uncle Will, an aging nationally syndicated
   entertainment columnist, introduces her to event planner Kelly.

   Shortly thereafter, Bette finds herself working for Kelly & Co.,
   planning parties, eating and drinking at the city's most fashionable
   night spots ... and becoming a regular subject of a popular online
   gossip column, whose anonymous author seems determined to link her
   romantically to wealthy playboy Philip Weston. While she does find
   Philip somewhat attractive, much like the heroines of the romance
   novels she secretly indulges in, and the association becomes of great
   benefit to her in her new job, she is later drawn to Sammy, a bouncer
   at Bungalow 8 who turns out to be from her hometown of Poughkeepsie and
   harbors ambitions of being a chef.

   The two connect on a trip to Istanbul, and Sammy's culinary skills
   impress Bette's parents, former 1960s radicals, on a Thanksgiving trip
   back to Poughkeepsie. But he, too, is tied to a wealthy socialite, and
   dreams of escaping the high life to open a small restaurant. Bette,
   meanwhile, finds herself growing distant from Penelope and her other
   friends, and must choose between the person she once was and the one
   she is becoming.
