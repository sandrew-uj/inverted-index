   The book concerns lonely teenager Jilly Farina and her relationship
   with Millroy. He is performing and calls her out of the audience and
   tells her he will train her to be his assistant. Millroy leaves the
   travelling fair and together with Jilly embarks on a mission to
   transform the food habits of America; converting them to Bible-based
   vegetarianism and promising his followers that they will live to be
   200. His evangelical fervour is backed up by miraculous tricks but
   attracts growing opposition. He goes on to create a top-rating
   television show and chain of 'Day One' diners staffed by young
   volunteers. As his public success grows Jilly becomes increasingly
   uncomfortable in her role as his confidante.
