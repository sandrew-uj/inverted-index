   The story centres around Dr. Noah Noyes, an authoritarian doctor and
   father whose obsession with God's law leads him to neglect his family;
   his wife, Mrs. Noyes, an alcoholic who talks to animals; and Mottyl,
   Mrs. Noyes's blind cat. Noah and Mrs. Noyes have three sons, Shem,
   Japeth, and Ham. Shem is married to Hannah, who spends a great deal of
   time with Dr. Noyes. Japeth is married to Emma, a young girl of about
   11, who refuses to consummate their marriage.

   One day, an exhausted Yaweh visits Dr. Noyes. Yaweh is depressed to the
   point of willfully allowing himself to die due to the treatment he has
   received from humanity. He tells Noyes that the people of the City
   threw offal, rotten fruit, and feces at his carriage and have
   assassinated him seven times. Yaweh remains depressed until he is
   inspired by a magic show Noah puts on to raise his spirits. Noah puts a
   penny under a glass bottle then fills the bottle with water. Due to
   refraction of the penny's image, the coin appears to vanish, but Yaweh
   becomes obsessed by the idea that the application of water can make
   things disappear.

   Soon Yaweh tells Noah to build an ark in preparation for the flood.
   Noah is resolutely obedient, but some in his family react negatively.
   Ham quickly marries Lucy, a mysterious seven-foot-tall woman with
   webbed fingers (a trait found only in angels, according to the novel)
   who is eventually revealed to be Lucifer in female form. As Yaweh
   leaves, Mottyl hears flies buzzing from within Yaweh's carriage and
   knows that Yaweh has resigned himself to death.

   Noah is adamant that Yaweh's edict must be followed to the letter and
   insists that there must be only two of every animal. Mrs. Noyes tries
   to bring Mottyl, who Noah has decreed must stay behind since he's
   chosen Yaweh's own two pet cats to represent felines on the ark. Noah
   sets fire to the house and barn, with Mottyl inside, offering all their
   additional animals as a giant sacrifice to Yaweh. Mrs. Noyes is enraged
   at the attempt to kill her cat and by the carnage in what is left of
   her home, and refuses to board the ark. Noah is concerned that if Mrs.
   Noyes does not come, the ark and its passengers will be doomed, as
   Yaweh's edict clearly states that Noah's wife must be aboard. Mrs.
   Noyes hides in Noah's orchard as the rain starts, but leaves when she
   notices Emma's sister Lotte, a "monkey child," trying to cross the
   river. Mrs. Noyes rescues Lotte and agrees to board only if Lotte can
   also come. Noah agrees to let Lotte on board, but has Japeth kill her
   shortly after. Mrs. Noyes again rebels, but ultimately agrees to board
   the ark and smuggles Mottyl aboard, hidden in her apron.

   As the voyage begins Noah quickly imposes his will on his family by
   drawing a line between the "rebellious" elements (Mrs. Noyes, Emma,
   Ham, and Lucy) and the rest (himself, Hannah, Japeth, and Shem). One
   day, dolphins swim by the ark, attempting to befriend the inhabitants.
   Noah decides that the dolphins must be pirates and has Japeth slaughter
   them. Mrs. Noyes attempts to stop him, and once the "pirates" have been
   defeated, Noah locks Mrs. Noyes, Lucy, Ham, and Emma in the lower
   levels of the ark, forcing them to care for the animals alone.
   Meanwhile, Noah, Hannah, Shem, and Japeth enjoy quarters on the deck of
   the ark and freedom from heavy chores.

   Noah notices that Japeth is becoming more preoccupied with sex and
   often eyes Hannah in a way that makes Noah wary. He decides that the
   solution is to force Emma to consummate their marriage. Noah has Emma
   brought to the deck and "inspects" her to see what the problem is. He
   decides that Emma's "tightness" is the reason why Japeth could not
   "gain entry" and requests that the Unicorn is brought to aid the
   problem. Noah uses the Unicorn to "open" Emma for Japeth, a process
   which traumatizes Emma and severely injures the Unicorn. When Japeth
   finds out what his father has done, he cuts off the Unicorn's horn.
   Emma is then forced to live on the top deck to be near her husband.

   Mrs. Noyes, Lucy, and Ham decide to rebel against Noah and the others.
   They formulate a plan to burn through the locked door using the two
   demons on board. They get the door open and plan to close the armoury,
   where Japeth sleeps, from the outside so as to neutralize Japeth.
   Unfortunately, Japeth is patrolling the deck and captures the escapees.
   He ties up Mrs. Noyes, Lucy, and Ham and throws the demons overboard,
   which enrages Lucy. She breaks free of her bonds and curses Japeth so
   that his wounds will never heal properly and he will always smell of
   the violence he has inflicted on others. Mrs. Noyes, Ham, and Lucy are
   locked below again, this time with boards and chains locking the door
   from the outside.

   Lucy plans another escape and has Crowe take a message to Emma to
   release them. Emma removes all the chains and bars while Noah and
   Hannah are preoccupied with praying, Shem is preoccupied with eating,
   and Japeth is preoccupied dressing his wounds. Mrs. Noyes, Lucy, and
   Ham bar the armoury and the chapel, locking in Noah, Hannah, and
   Japeth, but they are unable to find Shem.

   While locked in the chapel, Hannah's labour begins. She asks Noah to
   call for help, but he refuses to call for anyone until the baby is
   born. Noah knows that the baby is likely his and is worried that it
   will be a "monkey child" like Lotte, as Japeth's dead twin brother was
   also monkey-like. When the baby is born dead it is indeed revealed to
   be a "monkey child". Ham, hearing Hannah's cries of pain, opens the
   chapel door to help Hannah. He is quickly brained by Shem, but not
   before he sees Hannah's child. Hannah wraps it in blankets to hide its
   hairy arms and throws the baby overboard.

   A truce between the factions is tacitly called. The weather is sunny
   for the first time since the start of the rain, and Noah asks Emma to
   send a dove to look for land. When the dove does not return, they
   continue to send birds until Noah decides to send his own trained dove.
   Noah's dove returns with an olive branch, which Noah uses to prove
   Yaweh's edict. The other members of the ark remain unconvinced, as they
   know it is the same branch from the dove's cage. The novel ends with
   Mrs. Noyes sitting on deck with Mottyl, praying to the clouds for rain.
