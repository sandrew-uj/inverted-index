   The premise of it was one man who, in 2002, creates the smallpox virus
   himself, infects himself, and touches ten people in New York City. This
   eventually leads to a pandemic across the world that is later defeated,
   but not before 60 million people are killed.

   The film was commissioned before the September 11 attacks and is
   presented in the form of a fictional documentary, including false
   interviews and stock footage. The tagline for the movie was, "Drama,
   until it happens".
