   In the body of the work it is revealed that Jack Adams is actually a
   woman (Cassie) dressing in men's clothing, who has spent several years
   searching for her betrothed on various ocean voyages. She is so
   successful in her masquerade as a male that she actually works for the
   ship captains. The voyage described in Nequa is to the Arctic, where
   the ship becomes trapped in the ice. After several harrowing adventures
   the ship is freed and then proceeds to sail north. The Captain of the
   ship, Rafael Ganoa ( Cassie's betrothed) is amazed to find that when
   they reach a certain spot, which should be close to the north pole, the
   compasses show that the ship is suddenly traveling south.

   Actually they have sailed into the inside of the earth, where they meet
   the Altrurians, a society which has developed into a more cooperative
   society than those on the outside of the earth. Individual members of
   the Altrurian Society describe how the evolution of Altrurian society
   took place. These explanations reflect Populist thought of the time
   with definite feminist proclivities, providing the tone of a political
   novel.

   Jack Adams exposes his/her secret and is chastised by her betrothed
   Captain Ganoe as having broken several conventions that exist among the
   outer earth society. Jack Adams/Cassie Van Ness, now called Nequa (the
   teacher), takes a manuscript that she has written about this voyage and
   leaves in one of the new aeroplanes for the outside world to have the
   manuscript you have been reading published.
