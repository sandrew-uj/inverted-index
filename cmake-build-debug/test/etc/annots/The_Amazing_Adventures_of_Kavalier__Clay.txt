   The novel begins in 1939 with the arrival of 19-year-old Josef "Joe"
   Kavalier as a refugee in New York City, where he comes to live with his
   17-year-old cousin, Sammy Klayman. With the help of his mentor,
   Kornblum, Joe escapes Nazi-occupied Prague by hiding in a coffin. Joe
   leaves behind the rest of his family, including his younger brother
   Thomas. As the novel develops, both Joe and Sammy find their creative
   niches, one entrepreneurial, the other's artistic. Beyond having a
   shared interest in drawing, the duo share several connections to Jewish
   stage magician Harry Houdini: Josef (like comics legend Jim Steranko)
   studied magic and escapology in Prague, which aided him in his
   departure from Europe; Sammy is the son of the Mighty Molecule, a
   strongman on the vaudeville circuit.

   When Sammy discovers Joe's artistic talent, he gets Joe a job as an
   illustrator for a novelty products company, Empire Novelty. Sheldon
   Anapol, owner of Empire, motivated to share in the recent cultural and
   financial success of Superman, attempts to break into the comic-book
   business on the creative backs of Joe and Sammy. Under the name "Sam
   Clay", Sammy starts writing adventure stories with Joe illustrating
   them, and the two recruit several other Brooklyn teenagers to produce
   Amazing Midget Radio Comics (named to promote one of the company's
   novelty items). The pair is at once passionate about their creation,
   earnestly optimistic about making money, and always nervous about the
   opinion of their employers.

   The magazine features Sammy and Joe's character, the Escapist, an
   anti-fascist superhero who combines traits of (among others) Houdini,
   Captain America, Batman, the Phantom, and the Scarlet Pimpernel. The
   Escapist becomes tremendously popular, but like the talent behind
   Superman, the writers and artists of the comic get a minimal share of
   their publisher's revenue. Joe and Sammy are slow to realize that they
   are being exploited, as they have private concerns: Joe is trying to
   help his family escape from Prague and has fallen in love with the
   bohemian Rosa Saks, who has her own artistic aspirations, while Sammy
   works to find his sexual identity and seeks progress in his
   professional and literary career.

   For many months after coming to New York, Joe's drive to help his
   family shows through in his work, which remains violently anti-Nazi
   despite his employer's concerns. In the meantime, he spends more and
   more time with Rosa, appearing as a magician in the bar mitzvahs of the
   children of Rosa's father's acquaintances, even though he sometimes
   feels guilty for distracting himself from fighting for his family.
   Joe's efforts to bring his family to the States culminate in securing
   passage for his younger brother Thomas on the ship the Ark of Miriam.
   On the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbour however, it transpires that
   Thomas's ship has been sunk by a German U-boat. Distraught and unaware
   that Rosa is pregnant with his child, Joe abruptly enlists in the navy,
   hoping to fight the Germans. Instead, he is sent to a secluded naval
   base in Antarctica. After a faulty chimney fills the base with carbon
   monoxide, Joe emerges from this interlude the lone survivor from his
   station. When he makes it back to New York, he is ashamed to show his
   face again to Rosa and Sammy and eschews their expected reunion.
   Unbeknownst to his previous contacts in the city, he squats in a
   hideout in the Empire State Building, with only a small circle of
   magician-friends aware of his whereabouts.

   Parallel to Joe's experiences leading up to the United States' entrance
   into the war, Sammy develops a romantic relationship with the radio
   voice of The Escapist, Tracy Bacon. Tracy's movie-star good looks
   initially intimidate Sammy, but later they fall in love. When Tracy is
   cast as The Escapist for the film adaptation, he invites Sammy to move
   to Hollywood with him, an offer that Clay accepts. But later, when
   Tracy and Sammy go to a friend's beach house with several other gay
   couples, the private dinner is raided by the local police as well as
   two off-duty FBI agents. All of the men at the party are arrested,
   except for two who hide under the dinner table, one of whom is Sammy.
   The FBI agents use their authority to sexually abuse Sammy and the
   other man. After this episode, Sammy decides that he can't live with
   the constant threat of being persecuted and breaks off his relationship
   with Tracy. When Joe leaves to fight in the war, Sammy marries Rosa and
   moves with her to the suburbs, where they raise her son Tommy in what
   outwardly appears to be a traditional nuclear family.

   Sammy and Rosa cannot hide all their secrets from Tommy, however, who
   encounters Joe and begins to take private magic lessons in the Empire
   State Building with him for the better part of a year without anyone
   else's knowledge. Tommy is instrumental in finally reuniting the
   Kavalier and Clay duo, who swiftly find renewed enthusiasm in their
   comic endeavours. Joe moves into Sammy and Rosa's house and begins to
   rekindle his love with Rosa. Shortly afterwards, Sammy's homosexuality
   is revealed on public television when he speaks at the Senate
   Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency that is investigating claims of
   comic books' pernicious effect on children. This further complicates
   the attempts of Rosa, Sammy, and Joe to reconstitute a family. In the
   end, Sammy plans to move to LA in spite of Joe and Rosa's attempts to
   dissuade him, including Joe revealing he has bought Empire Comics. The
   following morning, they find Sammy gone.

   Many events in the novel are based on the lives of actual comic-book
   creators including Jack Kirby (to whom the book is dedicated in the
   afterword), Bob Kane, Stan Lee, Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Joe Simon,
   Will Eisner and Jim Steranko. Other historical figures play minor
   roles, including Salvador Dali, Al Smith, Orson Welles and Fredric
   Wertham. The novel's time span roughly mirrors that of the Golden Age
   of Comics itself, starting from shortly after the debut of Superman and
   concluding with the Kefauver Senate hearings, two events often used to
   demarcate the era.
