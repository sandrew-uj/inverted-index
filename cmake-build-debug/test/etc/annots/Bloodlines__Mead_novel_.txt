   After helping rogue Dhampir Rose Hathaway evade justice, Sydney Sage's
   situation with the Alchemists is shaky at best. Her career is
   jeopardized to the point where she may have to undergo re-education.
   Woken in the middle of the night, Sydney is given a last chance: to
   pose as the older sister of Jill Dragomir ( illegitimate sister of
   Vasilisa Dragomir ) at a boarding school in Palm Springs California and
   assists Keith the alchemist whom she hates and also studied with
   Sydney's father to conceal her identity to those who oppose Vasilisa.
   This is because of the family quorum law which means that if Jill were
   to die Vasilisa would have no family left and would have to abdicate
   the throne. This is all set in motion due to an attack on Jill which
   was violent and brutal. Sydney, Jill, Eddie Castile, and Adrian head
   off to Palm Springs. Sydney and Jill room together while Eddie rooms
   with Micah which is later said to remind Eddie of his dead best friend
   Mason from St. Vladimir's Academy.

   On the first day of school, Jill is sent back to her dorm room accused
   of having a hangover in the morning. While Sydney visits Adrian in the
   afternoon, he reveals that he and Jill are bonded from the attack which
   actually killed Jill, but Adrian, being a spirit user, brought her back
   from the dead - she is now shadow kissed. This is why she always knows
   what Adrian is thinking and why she feels hungover every morning. As
   time goes on, Sydney is excelling in school while Jill is seen to have
   few friends and is continuously picked on by Laurel due to her crush on
   Micah, as he shows an interest in Jill.

   When meeting with an older Moroi - Clarence, who is housing Adrian,
   Jill starts to fall for the Moroi's 19-year-old son Lee. Lee takes the
   whole squad mini-golfing and Jill uses her water magic much to Sydney's
   disdain, as it freaks her out reminding her of her alchemist training
   that Moroi are unnatural creatures made from evil.

   While at school, Sydney starts to get friendly with a boy who helps out
   in her history class. Trey asks Sydney about the lily tattoo on her
   cheek, which is the sign of an alchemist. Many in the school have
   similar tattoos that give them drug-like effects similar to steroids or
   marijuana. Sydney tells Keith about the alchemist-like tattoos, but
   Keith brushes it off. After talking to her friends, Sydney discovers
   that the tattoos are given by a place called Nevermore and she finds
   vials of Moroi blood and saliva along with copper and silver. When
   visiting Adrian, Sydney sees a needle sized hole in Clarence's neck and
   deduces that Keith has been supplying Nevermore. Thus, she has him
   removed by the Alchemists.

   Jill is in a fashion show at a local boutique and after the show Adrian
   and Sydney get into an argument because Sydney has been paying for
   Adrian to go to college classes without him knowing. Sydney was worried
   he would drop out before next semester, but seeing as damaging it is to
   Jill she decides to go to Keith's house and let Lee drop Jill back at
   school.

   While clearing out Keith's things, Lee turns up and Sydney discovers
   that Lee was a strigoi, but he was turned back by a spirit user. This
   means that he ages slower and may be unable to access his magic. Lee
   also wishes to be turned back into a strigoi, but is unable to and he's
   the reason for all of the unknown deaths in Palm Springs including that
   of his cousin. Adrian show up at Keith's house, but both he and Sydney
   are restrained and Lee called his strigoi friends using Sydney and
   Adrian as a bargain for being re-awakened. Once the strigoi turn up and
   try to change Lee into one of them he instead dies then Sydney, Adrian,
   and the two strigoi get into a fight. One strigoi goes to drink
   Sydney's blood, but cannot as it is too vile and tastes horrible, but
   as they feed on Adrian. Sydney uses a fire charm that she created on a
   whim of her history teacher Mrs.Terwilliger to distract the strigoi.
   Just then, Eddie and Jill show up and with the help of Jill's water
   magic Eddie kills both strigoi.

   After the encounter, the alchemist offer Sydney Keith's apartment, but
   knowing Adrian's wishes, she instead asks that Adrian be given the
   apartment in exchange for his assistance in the research into spirit
   users and Strigoi and why they cannot be reawakened. Sydney instead
   requests her own dorm room on campus, allowing her to continue to watch
   Jill. Back at school, Sydney confronts her teacher about the amulet,
   and the teacher confesses she had known about vampires all along as
   well as Alchemists. She believes that Sydney has an innate magical
   ability, and it was that ability that gave the amulet its power.

   Abe Mazur, Rose's father, arrives with Jill's new roommate - a Dhampir
   named Angeline who Sydney met while on the run with Rose the previous
   year. Adrian realizes that Abe has been keeping a close eye on Palm
   Springs because of Nevermore - and that Abe himself is likely
   trafficking vampire blood as well. Abe, in turn, reveals to Adrian that
   the reason Sydney had been forced to obey his commands was that Sydney
   had contracted him for an attack on Keith that left him with a glass
   eye - retribution for Keith's rape of her sister.
