   Galapagos is the story of a small band of mismatched humans who are
   shipwrecked on the fictional island of Santa Rosalia in the Galapagos
   Islands after a global financial crisis cripples the world's economy.
   Shortly thereafter, a disease renders all humans on Earth infertile,
   with the exception of the people on Santa Rosalia, making them the last
   specimens of humankind. Over the next million years, their descendants,
   the only fertile humans left on the planet, eventually evolve into a
   furry species resembling sea lions: though possibly still able to walk
   upright (it is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that they
   occasionally catch land animals), they have a snout with teeth adapted
   for catching fish, a streamlined skull and flipper-like hands with
   rudimentary fingers (described as "nubbins").

   The story's narrator is a spirit who has been watching over humans for
   the last million years. This particular ghost is the immortal spirit of
   Leon Trotsky Trout, son of Vonnegut's recurring character Kilgore
   Trout. Leon is a Vietnam War veteran who is affected by the massacres
   in Vietnam. He goes AWOL and settles in Sweden, where he works as a
   shipbuilder and dies during the construction of the ship, the Bahia de
   Darwin. This ship is used for the "Nature Cruise of the Century".
   Planned as a celebrity cruise, it was in limbo due to the economic
   downturn, and due to a chain of unconnected events the ship ended up
   allowing humans to reach and survive in the Galapagos. A group of girls
   from a cannibal tribe living in the Amazon rainforest, called the
   Kanka-bono girls also end up on the ship, eventually having numerous
   children with the ship's captain.

   The deceased Kilgore Trout makes four appearances in the novel, urging
   his son to enter the "blue tunnel" that leads to the afterlife. When
   Leon refuses for the fourth time, Kilgore pledges that he, and the blue
   tunnel, will not return for one million years, which leaves Leon to
   observe the slow process of evolution that transforms the humans into
   aquatic mammals. The process begins when a Japanese woman on the
   island, the granddaughter of a Hiroshima survivor, gives birth to a
   fur-covered daughter.

   Trout maintains that all the sorrows of humankind were caused by "the
   only true villain in my story: the oversized human brain". Natural
   selection eliminates this problem, since the humans best fitted to
   Santa Rosalia were those who could swim best, which required a
   streamlined head, which in turn required a smaller brain.
