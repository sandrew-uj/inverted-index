   In December 2009, Murdoch Ross and his friend Lee Francis Walker visit
   Murdoch's grandfather, Sir Charles Ross, in his castle in Storbannon,
   Scotland. Sir Charles is a Nobel Prize winner for his work in particle
   physics -- more specifically the isolation of free quarks.

   In this novel, when a nucleon decays into three quarks, the first two
   quarks appear immediately and the third quark appears on the order of a
   few millionths of an "yoctosecond" later. A widely accepted theory is
   that the original decay produces two quarks and also a third unknown
   particle, dubbed the "quason". This is subsequently transformed into a
   third quark.

   Sir Charles offers a different and radical explanation: all three of
   the quarks are created at once, but the first two are "propagated back
   in time". Charles dubs the energy which had allowed the propagation
   through time as "tau waves". Although his theory is seemingly valid and
   consistent, the physicists of his time refuse to accept it because of
   its implications -- namely the failure of some of the physical laws of
   conservation. Sir Charles then retreats to his family's castle in
   Scotland to continue his research in private. There, he succeeds in
   building a time machine capable of sending messages to the future and
   the past.

   When the two young men arrive, Sir Charles takes them down into the
   basement, where the machine is found. As they enter the basement, a
   computer attached to the machine produces data on a sheet of paper,
   which Sir Charles hides from the other men. He asks Murdoch to type in
   a six-character random message into the computer. Sir Charles next
   activates his machine and transmits the message one minute back in
   time. Finally, he shows the paper printed out previously, and Murdoch
   and Lee are amazed: the printout contained exactly the same random
   characters that Murdoch typed, and these were printed before Murdoch
   had typed them in.

   After Murdoch and Lee have gotten over their initial amazement, they
   decide to experiment with the machine. Murdoch tries to fool the
   machine into creating a causality paradox, by deliberately receiving a
   message from the future, and not sending the message back at the due
   time. Suddenly, the entire system turns bizarre, and they are flooded
   with messages from all over the ten-minute range of the machine. Then
   they abruptly turn off the machine and leave.

   While outside, Murdoch and Lee talk about the implications of the
   machine's existence and how the space-time continuum could allow for
   time travel without introducing a paradox. They formulate theories
   similar to the many-worlds interpretation, finally deciding that none
   of the theories they discuss fit their previous observations.

   The next day, Ted Cartland, a friend of Charles and a former Royal Air
   Force officer, arrives to examine the machine he had helped build. They
   repeat the experiment, and Ted is bewildered as well. Ted, however, has
   a trick up his sleeve. He writes a computer program to do what Murdoch
   had done the day before, to remove the human element from the
   experiment.

   The machine picks up an unexpected message, telling the experimenters
   that a glass jar had been broken. True enough, Lee was on the verge of
   accidentally pushing a jar off a shelf. However, they are unable to
   contact their future selves with the broken jar, since they apparently
   no longer exist. Sir Charles decides that upon sending the message
   back, the copies of themselves in the future had changed their past and
   thus had been erased from existence. The altered timeline, with its
   unbroken jar, overwrote the old one rather like recording over an old
   TV program on a videotape. Thus causality had been preserved. The fear
   of being erased chills them, and so they quickly disable the machine
   again.

   As time goes by, they establish an experimental protocol, and they set
   up automated tests to gain more information about the physics behind
   the machine. The machine is upgraded to allow for more data throughput
   and a time range of about 24 hours. Murdoch also meets a young woman
   named Anne Patterson when she trips over Sir Charles's kitten while she
   was out shopping in Kingussie.

   They immediately fall in love. It turns out later that she is a
   physicist at the site of the new fusion reactor in Burghead. Elizabeth
   Muir, another close friend of Sir Charles, works there as well, and he
   invites her to his castle to investigate the peculiar machine.
