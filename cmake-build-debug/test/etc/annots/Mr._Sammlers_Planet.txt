   Mr. Artur Sammler, Holocaust survivor, intellectual, and occasional
   lecturer at Columbia University in 1960s New York City, is a "registrar
   of madness", a refined and civilized being caught among people crazy
   with the promises of the future (moon landings, endless possibilities).
   "Sorry for all and sore at heart", he observes how greater luxury and
   leisure have only led to more human suffering.

   To Mr. Sammler--who by the end of the novel has found the compassionate
   consciousness necessary to bridge the gap between himself and his
   fellow beings--a good life is one in which a person does what is
   "required of him". To know and to meet the "terms of the contract" was
   as true a life as one could live.
