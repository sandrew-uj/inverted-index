   The novel shows a dystopian early 21st-century America dominated by
   computer networks, and is considered by some critics to be an early
   ancestor of the cyberpunk genre.^[5] The hero, Nick Haflinger, is a
   runaway from Tarnover, a government program intended to find, educate
   and indoctrinate highly gifted children to further the interests of the
   state in a future where quantitative analysis backed by the tacit
   threat of coercion has replaced overt military and economic power as
   the deciding factor in international competition. In parallel with
   this, the government has become a de facto oligarchy whose
   beneficiaries are members of organised crime.

   Nick's talent extends to programming the network using only a
   touch-tone telephone. One of his handlers at Tarnover explains that
   this is like a classical pianist being able to play entire sonatas and
   concertos from memory. However, Nick also has some personality flaws,
   amounting almost to a deathwish. These become manifest in exhibitions
   of his abilities, revealing his identity to his pursuers.

   The background to the story includes a massive earthquake laying waste
   to the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Millions die and millions
   more are left to live on government handouts. The subsequent economic
   depression, coupled with the rootlessness enabled by access to online
   data and strong social pressure to be flexible (the results of
   corporations wanting highly mobile workforces without strong local
   ties), results in a fragmentation of society along religious, ethnic,
   and a variety of class markers, what Toffler called "subcults",
   including what would in 2010 be described as gangs. The equitable
   distribution of data access and data privacy is a prominent theme in
   the book; characters who have access to information which is nominally
   secret enjoy demonstrable economic advantages over others lacking
   access to such data. In the novel, data privacy is reserved for
   corporate entities and individuals, who may then conceal wrongdoing; by
   contrast, normal citizens do not enjoy significant privacy.^[citation

   The world described in the book is dystopian, with laissez-faire
   economics portrayed as leading to disaster^[citation needed] as greed
   trumps long-term planning. The educational system is dysfunctional,
   with teachers unable to perform their jobs due to strictures. The only
   functional educational system seen in the book is portrayed as an
   enclave, the tightly-controlled Tarnover school. Communities are either
   walled enclaves of privilege or largely lawless areas entirely lacking
   protection from corrupt civil authorities. Infrastructure has been
   allowed to crumble, and characters who reside within "paid avoidance
   zones" receive compensation from the government in lieu of actual
   services.
