   Note: This Summary does not contain the whole book, nor end at the
   ending. The stream-of-consciousness style being so prominent in this
   work, a summary of the plot based on physical action does not give a
   thorough understanding of the content of the work. In the novel, action
   occurring in the physical world (i.e.: characters doing things, such as
   talking, walking etc.) is far outweighed by material existing in the
   thought and memory of the protagonists. Some discretion must be made in
   a plot summary as to which of these thoughts and memories warrant
   detailing.
