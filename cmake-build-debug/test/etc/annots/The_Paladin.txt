   The Paladin (Baen Books, 2002 re-issue)

   The Lord Saukendar, Imperial sword master and stalwart supporter of the
   Emperor is betrayed, falsely accused of an affair with his childhood
   sweetheart Lady Meiya, now the Emperor's wife. Meiya is dead, and
   hostile forces have command of the Emperor's regency. Wounded,
   desperate and cut off from his supporters, Saukendar runs for the
   border.

   In a homemade cabin high in the hills Saukendar survives crippled and
   alone, his warhorse Jiro and his regrets his only company, while the
   empire is bled by the rapacious warlords that are regent to the
   Emperor. Only occasional assassins dispatched by the Regent disturb his
   morose existence.

   Taizu, a country girl from Hua locates him, demands he teach her
   sufficient swordsmanship to exact her revenge for her people's
   suffering. Despite his better judgment and strenuous efforts to
   discourage her, she forces him to take her on as apprentice
   swordswoman. Shoka, as he prefers to be known to his friends, becomes
   fond of the girl.

   In the process of teaching her and supporting her cause, they become
   embroiled in the affairs of empire, becoming the spearhead of a revolt
   that rescues the Emperor from his Regent and his people from the
   clutches of the warlords.
