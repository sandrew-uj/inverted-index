   The novel is about a lonely young man, Frederick Clegg, who works as a
   clerk in a city hall and collects butterflies in his spare time. The
   first part of the novel tells the story from his point of view.

   Clegg is obsessed with Miranda Grey, a middle-class art student at the
   Slade School of Fine Art. He admires her from a distance but is unable
   to make any contact with her because he is socially underdeveloped. One
   day, he wins a large prize in the football pools. He quits his job and
   buys an isolated house in the countryside. He feels lonely, however,
   and wants to be with Miranda. Unable to make any normal contact, Clegg
   decides to add her to his "collection" of pretty, preserved objects, in
   the hope that if he keeps her captive long enough, she will grow to
   love him.

   After careful preparations, he kidnaps Miranda by drugging her with
   chloroform and locks her up in the cellar of his house. He is convinced
   that Miranda will start to love him after some time. However, when she
   wakes up, she confronts him with his actions. Clegg is embarrassed and
   promises to let her go after a month. He promises to show her "every
   respect", pledging not to sexually molest her and to shower her with
   gifts and the comforts of home, on one condition: she can't leave the
   cellar.

   The second part of the novel is narrated by Miranda in the form of
   fragments from a diary that she keeps during her captivity. Miranda
   reminisces over her previous life throughout this section of the novel;
   and many of her diary entries are written either to her sister or to a
   man named G.P., whom she respected and admired as an artist. Miranda
   reveals that G.P. ultimately fell in love with her and consequently
   severed all contact with her.

   At first, Miranda thinks that Clegg has sexual motives for abducting
   her; but, as his true character begins to be revealed, she realises
   that this is not true. She begins to pity her captor, comparing him to
   Caliban in Shakespeare's play The Tempest because of his hopeless
   obsession with her. Clegg tells Miranda that his first name is
   Ferdinand (eventual winner of Miranda's affections in The Tempest).

   Miranda tries to escape several times, but Clegg stops her. She also
   tries to seduce him to convince him to let her go. The only result is
   that he becomes confused and angry. As Clegg repeatedly refuses to
   release her, she begins to fantasize about killing him. After a failed
   attempt to do so, Miranda enters a period of self-loathing. She decides
   that to kill Clegg would lower her to his level. She refrains from any
   further attempts to do so. Before she can try to escape again, she
   becomes seriously ill and dies.

   The third part of the novel is narrated by Clegg. At first, he wants to
   commit suicide after he finds Miranda dead; but, after he reads in her
   diary that she never loved him, he decides that he is not responsible
   for what happened to her and is better off without her. He buries her
   corpse in the garden. The book ends with his announcement that he plans
   to kidnap another girl.
