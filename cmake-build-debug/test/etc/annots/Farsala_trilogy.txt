   The story switches between three main characters, Jiaan, Soraya and
   Kavi, and Farsala's history. There is war happening in Farsala, against
   the mighty Hrum empire.

   Jiaan: Jiaan is half blood, as his father is the commander of Farsala's
   army, and his mother a peasant woman. He is half brother to Soraya,
   although she does not acknowledge him as a brother. Jiann serves as his
   father's aide, taking notes during meetings and being kind of an
   apprentice. Jiann is traveling with his father and a band of deghans to
   find a secure flat terrain to fight the Hrum. Most of the book, he
   suffers rude comments and disrespect from the deghans about his
   half-blood. When the first battle occurs, Jiann is chosen to carry the
   banner behind the commander, a very honorable position. However, during
   the battle, he tries to help his father, the commander, fight, but ends
   up being knocked to the ground and nearly trampled. He watches as the
   commander, to end the battle, decides to fight against one other
   warrior in a duel to see who will win the battle. If the commander won
   the duel, his own army would win the battle. If his opponent won, then
   their side would win. Instead, the Hrum send a barrage of arrows
   towards the commander, and kill him that way instead. Jiann is overcome
   with grief at his father's death, and takes command of the army.

   Soraya: Soraya is very stuck-up, and selfish. She does, however, have a
   nicer side. She is her father, the commander, favorite child. She is
   half sister to Jiann, although she does not acknowledge that. Her
   father's priests are bribed by someone who wants to be commander, to
   say that the commander must sacrifice her to win the war. The commander
   fakes the sacrifice and sends her into hiding with a family on the
   country side. She is disdainful at first, but soon begins to lend a
   hand to putting food on the table. She hunts for the family, when one
   night she gets chased by jackals, and is saved by a tribe called the
   Suud. The lady who saved her, Maok, teaches her "magic" or how to speak
   to spirits of things like fire and water, trees and animals. She leaves
   the tribe after a month or two and returns to the countryside family to
   the news of her father's death. She vows to find the rest of her family
   and avenge her father.

   Kavi: Kavi's story is short. He used to be an apprentice smith, but due
   to an "accident" with a deghan, he loses the use of his hand and
   becomes a peddler selling minor smith goods. On his journey he is
   caught by the commander when he tries to sell a fake gold bracelet
   (bronze bracelet coated in gold), and is made to promise to check on
   Soraya on the countryside and report back to him. He is then caught by
   the Hrum, he learns about then and eventually acts as a spy for them.
   Kavi is indirectly the cause of the commanders death because he betrays
   the Farsalan army's plan to the Hrum. He is bitter towards the deghans
   and wishes them overthrown. When Kavi realizes that the deghans do not
   deserve to become slaves, and that not all Hrum are as good as they
   claim to be, he has a change of heart and becomes one of the main
   leaders of the resistance.
