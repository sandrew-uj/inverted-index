   The prologue introduces the setting, a future North America divided
   between rival criminal gangs the Syndic on the East Coast and the Mob
   in Chicago, who have driven the federal government into exile in
   Iceland, Ireland and other North Atlantic islands. Life has more or
   less returned to normal in Syndic territory - as long as protection
   money is paid on time. The rest of the world has collapsed into either
   peasant life or tribalism.

   Attitudes to sex are generally tolerant, with free sex outside of
   marriage and both polygamy and polyandry accepted. (However, male
   homosexuality is not, and lesbianism is never mentioned.)

   The protagonist, Charles Orsino, is a low-ranking member of the Syndic
   who collects protection money in New York. After a failed assassination
   attempt, he is invited to a meeting of the leaders of the Syndic, who
   suspect that the exiled government were responsible. To discover the
   truth, Charles volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the
   government, with a false personality created by hypnosis to fool lie
   detectors. He is taken to the main naval base on the shores of Ireland.
   He also visits Ireland outside of government territory: it is tribal
   and governed by sorceresses who have genuine powers of telepathy. It is
   mentioned in passing that England is also tribal and much weaker.

   While escaping home, he also visits Mob territory and finds it much
   more disorganised. He proposes that the Syndic becomes more like a
   regular government to protect itself. But his mentor rejects this, and
   the book ends on that note.
