   In the aftermath of World War III, the world has plunged into anarchy
   and chaos. Water is scarce and what is left of the human race scrounges
   for survival. Two opposing martial arts schools, North Star and
   Southern Cross, both devoted to bringing order to the world, were
   previously thrown into disarray after Southern Cross adept Shin turned
   against his masters and summarily executed North Star master Ryuken,
   leaving his son Kenshiro as the sole heir to the North Star. Shin then
   sought Kenshiro himself, defeated him and left him for dead after
   carving his chest with seven scars in the shape of the Big Dipper. Shin
   also abducted Kenshiro's fiancee and their shared love interest Julia,
   segregating her in his tower. Since then, Shin rules the land with an
   iron fist through a militia called the Crossmen, led by Jackal, a
   ruthless henchman whose bulging head is held in leather bandages after
   Kenshiro disfigured him in an earlier fight.

   Back in the current time, Kenshiro, who survived Shin's aggression,
   wanders the wasteland aimlessly. After killing a gang led by bandit
   Zeed, who attacked the homestead that had given him shelter for the
   night, Kenshiro continues on towards the town of Paradise Valley, home
   to one of the few remaining sources of pure water. There, he meets
   orphan siblings Bat and Lynn. After using a pressure point technique to
   restore Lynn's sight, which she lost after watching her parents
   murdered by Crossmen, Kenshiro departs, ignoring Lynn's plea to remain
   and protect them. Bat follows Kenshiro to talk him into joining the
   organized resistance against the Crossmen's incursions, to no avail.

   The Crossmen raid Paradise Valley and occupy it, commandeering the
   well. Jackal orders Lynn's execution for sedition, but halts it after
   she threateningly mentions Kenshiro, taking her prisoner instead to
   extort Kenshiro's whereabouts. As Lynn's screams from afar ring inside
   Kenshiro's head, Kenshiro turns back: he and Bat infiltrate the
   occupied town and free Lynn, but Bat is mortally wounded in a fight
   against Jackal. Kenshiro spares Jackal and sends him back to Shin to
   announce his arrival.

   By Shin's order, Jackal takes Julia to the tower's basement to hide her
   from Kenshiro. There, he engages in a cat-and-mouse game in an attempt
   to rape and kill Julia. Kenshiro breaks into Shin's tower and confronts
   him in the throne room. As Kenshiro gains the upper hand in the ensuing
   showdown, Shin lies about Julia's fate and takes advantage of
   Kenshiro's shock to overpower him. However, after noticing a bud that
   has sprouted from a seed he had given Julia long before, Kenshiro
   regains hope and defeats Shin, killing him. After freeing herself from
   Jackal by removing his bandages and causing his head to swell and
   explode, Julia rejoins Kenshiro. The surviving Crossmen bow to Kenshiro
   and Julia in deference.
