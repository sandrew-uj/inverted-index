   The Witcher (Polish: Wiedzmin, pronounced [|v;Edm;in]) is a series of 6
   fantasy novels and 15 short stories written by Polish author Andrzej
   Sapkowski. The series revolves around the eponymous "witcher," Geralt
   of Rivia. In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are beast hunters who
   develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle wild beasts and
   monsters. The books have been adapted into a film (The Hexer), two
   television series (The Hexer and The Witcher), a trilogy of video games
   (The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and The Witcher 3:
   Wild Hunt), and a graphic novel series. The series of novels is known
   as the Witcher Saga. The short stories and novels have been translated
   into numerous languages, including Chinese, English, French, German,
   Italian, Russian, Lithuanian, Czech, Spanish and Ukrainian.

   The books have been described as having a cult following in Poland and
   in Central and Eastern European countries.^[1]^[2] The video games have
   been very successful; as of 28 May 2020, The Witcher series has sold
   over 50 million copies worldwide.^[3]
