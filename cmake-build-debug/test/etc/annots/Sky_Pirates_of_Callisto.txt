   Jonathan Dark (Jandar), earthman mysteriously transported to the Jovian
   moon of Callisto (or Thanator), has in concert with the native Ku Thad
   succeeded in freeing the city of Shondakar from the occupying Black
   Legion and the opportunistic Zanadarian Sky Pirates. The only fly in
   the ointment is that Shondakar's rightful ruler, the princess Darloona,
   has been abducted by the fleeing Prince Thuton of Zanadar.

   To free Darloona, Jandar adopts the wild plan of taking one of the Sky
   Pirates' own captured airships to raid the enemy city. A Zanadarian
   prisoner brought along to help operate the craft treacherously scuttles
   the scheme by throwing Jandar overboard and sabotaging the airship.

   Plopped into the Corund Laj, Thanator's greater sea, Jandar finds
   himself close enough to land to swim to safety, only to be enslaved by
   the mercantile Perushtar who rule its waves. Ironically, this results
   in him reaching his destination after all, as he is sold to the
   Zanadarians as gladitorial fodder. He has his hands full simultaneously
   surviving as a gladiator, hiding his identity as the Sky Pirates' arch
   enemy, and stirring up a revolt among his fellow slaves.

   As the revolution ignites and he is found out, his allies' airship, now
   repaired, swoops in to administer the coup de grace. Zanadar is
   destroyed and the menace of the Sky Pirates ended by the explosion of
   the pocket of "lifting gas" over which the city is built and on which
   its air power is based. Best of all, Jandar at last finds favor with
   the rescued Darloona, whose relationship with him amid the perils and
   reverses of the previous books has been decidedly rocky.
