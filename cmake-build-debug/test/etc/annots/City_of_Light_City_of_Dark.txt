   An enigmatic race of beings known as the Kurbs are introduced at the
   story's outset. Except as serpentine extensions of shadow, they are
   rarely seen, and thrive only in darkness. Utilizing something called
   the Power, they are able to control the rhythm of day and night. When
   humans first arrived on Manhattan Island (a place of apparent
   significance to the Kurbs), a treaty was signed: the Ritual Cycle of
   Acknowledgment. The Kurbs would loan the island out for human use, and
   even share their source of power. But there were conditions: in
   synchronization with the summer and winter solstices, the source of
   Power would be ritualistically hidden somewhere on the island, and if
   it was not found in time, the Kurbs would reclaim the island, and
   everything would freeze. Over the years, the Power was hidden inside
   different objects, including an ear of corn, a musket ball, an oil lamp
   and, most recently, a subway token. A lineage of women were given the
   responsibility of carrying out the Ritual Cycle Of Acknowledgment, and
   were granted special powers through the Kurbs' source of Power, as
   well.

   This system works for centuries until evil Mr. Underton tried to steal
   the Power a few years back, and lost his eyesight. Now he is close to
   stealing it once again, and if he succeeds, the Kurbs will take back
   the City, reducing it to a dark and frozen tundra. It's up to two kids
   named Carlos and Sarah to find the subway token with the Power and keep
   the City safe, despite secrets of Sarah's history that are entwined
   with the token. What ensues is a race against darkness. A race against
   the lies of the past. And most of all, a race against time.
