   The first character introduced is a man called Paul Jonas, apparently
   an infantryman on the Western Front of the First World War. In what he
   at first believes to be a dream or hallucination, he meets a woman with
   wings, who gives him a feather. He wakes from the experience to find
   himself back in the trenches, but realizes the experience was not a
   dream when he discovers the feather. Two of his comrades, Finch and
   Mullet, begin to express doubts about his sanity. Eventually, Paul runs
   off into no-man's land. There, he finds the bird-woman but Finch and
   Mullet have pursued him, and they have been transformed into monstrous
   shapes: Mullet is grossly fat and Finch has no eyes. Paul flees in
   terror and falls through a hole in space. He discovers himself in a
   place similar to the chess-land in Lewis Carroll's Through the
   Looking-Glass, where he is caught in the battle between the red and the
   white, as well as hunted by Finch and Mullet. He escapes with a young
   boy he met at an inn, whose name is Gally. They find themselves on
   Mars, which is inhabited by creatures who demand a sacrifice of a
   princess from the planet Venus each year. He recognizes the chosen
   woman as the winged woman he met earlier, but he cannot remember when
   he met her. His memory does not even extend to his time in the
   chess-land. With the help of other men from Earth, he rescues the
   princess, then flees from the angry Martians. He sees Mullet and Finch
   again, however, and tries to escape in a hijacked airship. He loses
   control of the airship and finds himself in a conservatory with a harp,
   which shrinks to the size of his palm. Mullet and Finch confront him,
   demanding that he give them the harp, but he refuses and appears again
   on the airship, which is hurtling toward the ground. Transported to yet
   another world, he is rescued from a frozen river by a group of
   Neanderthals, and a voice comes from the harp, telling him that friends
   will search for him on the river.

   The story moves to the late 21st century. The most significant
   technological change is the wide availability of virtual reality
   interfaces among all parts of society. The internet has been replaced
   by "the Net," a vast network of online VR environments. In Durban, a VR
   programming instructor named Irene "Renie" Sulaweyo is teaching a
   Kalahari San named !Xabbu how to create such environments, while
   providing for her family. Her family is made up by her alcoholic father
   Long Joseph and her ten-year-old brother Stephen. Stephen spends much
   of his time online and frequently joins his friends in escapades to
   forbidden areas of the net. When he somehow ends up in a coma after
   visiting a forbidden club, she and !Xabbu decide to investigate. Inside
   the club, they discover a number of very unsavoury entertainments, and
   are very nearly trapped by the managers. Their most bizarre and
   horrifying discovery is a very powerful hypnotic entity, which Renie
   nearly dies trying to escape from. Convinced that the club is set up to
   damage the minds of children, as it has done to Stephen, she resolves
   to stop the people responsible. She finds an unusual and large piece of
   code, in the form of a golden diamond, on her machine, and consults her
   friend and mentor, Dr. Susan van Bleeck, about it. As they examine it,
   it erupts into an image of a golden city, then disappears. Renie's
   difficulties multiply, as it becomes clear that her investigations have
   earned her powerful enemies: she is stood down from her job and unknown
   persons set fire to her family's apartment complex. Finally, van Bleeck
   is brutally assaulted and dies after leaving Renie and !Xabbu with
   three names: Martine Desroubins, Blue Dog Anchorite, and Bolivar
   Atasco. The first two are hackers that agree to help them find the
   golden city, which is in a mysterious network called "Otherland", while
   the third is an anthropologist and archaeologist whose expertise is
   pre-Columbian Latin America. Blue Dog Anchorite reveals himself to be
   Murat Sagar Singh, a retired programmer who worked on the security
   system for Otherland, and whose colleagues on the same project have
   been dying in unusual circumstances. He also reveals that Otherland was
   commissioned by a secret organisation called "The Grail Brotherhood",
   and that Atasco, who oversaw the security project for Otherland, was an
   important member of that organisation. Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, and
   Singh plan to break into Otherland; Renie and !Xabbu, along with Long
   Joseph and van Bleeck's assistant Jeremiah Dako, travel to Wasps' Nest,
   a mothballed military base in the Drakensberg mountains, where there is
   equipment allowing Renie and !Xabbu to stay connected to the Net for
   extended periods. Preparations completed, they hack into Otherland, but
   Singh is confronted and killed by the security system. He is later
   found dead in his room from a heart attack. Renie, !Xabbu, and Martine
   manage to enter Otherland and make their way to the golden city, which
   is called Temilun. There, they meet the God-King, who reveals himself
   to be Atasco.

   In suburban California, a terminally-ill teenager named Orlando
   Gardiner has become the most celebrated warrior in Middle Country, an
   online VR MMORPG based on swords-and-sorcery. However, while playing
   the game, he is distracted by a vision of a golden city and killed by a
   low-level monster. With the help of his friend, Sam Fredericks, he
   begins to investigate. Their investigations lead to TreeHouse, an
   online fringe community, and to Melchior, a code name used by Singh and
   others. Following the trail, they are mysteriously taken to a beach on
   a river. Across the river, they can see the golden city. They build a
   raft to cross the river, but are stopped by the police and taken to the
   palace of the God-King.

   On an army base in North Carolina, the young girl Christabel Sorensen
   becomes friends with Mr. Sellars, a mysterious old man living on the
   base. She is unaware that he is under house arrest, and her father, a
   senior military security officer, is in charge of guarding him. She
   helps him to escape from his house into a network of tunnels lying
   underneath the base.

   The Grail Brotherhood emerges as a small number of the world's
   wealthiest and most powerful people who have formed an exclusive
   society. Otherland is their private network, where many of them own
   numerous simulation worlds (others being leased out for very large
   sums), and they intend to use it for even more mysterious purposes.
   They meet in a simulation based on ancient Egypt, where their leader,
   Felix Jongleur, appears as Osiris and obliges other members to present
   themselves as various Egyptian deities. Jongleur commissions an
   employee, John Dread, to carry out a task referred to as the "Sky God
   Project." Dread promises to accomplish his mission, although it is not
   stated what exactly he must do.

   Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, Orlando, Fredericks, and four other people in
   similar situations find themselves imprisoned in a virtual reality
   world so complex that it rivals reality. There, they meet Atasco and
   his wife, and learn that Atasco, though formerly a member of the Grail
   Brotherhood, has been uninvolved for some time (though he has been
   permitted to retain his simulation world), and is now secretly opposing
   the Brotherhood's plans. They meet the enigmatic Mr. Sellars, who tells
   them that the network is somehow built from the minds of catatonic
   children worldwide, and he calls upon the small group of adventurers to
   stop the Grail Brotherhood.

   Before they can get their questions answered, however, the meeting
   descends into chaos. Unknown to any of those gathered, Dread and a team
   of expert assassins have attacked the Atascos' island home in Colombia,
   and Bolivar and his wife are suddenly murdered. Sellars gives the
   adventurers some brief instructions: they are to search along the river
   for Paul Jonas, who is at large within Otherland's many simulation
   worlds, then he too vanishes. Even as the adventurers flee Temilun,
   Dread, with the help of criminal hacker Dulcie Anwin, hijacks the
   simulation body of one of their party. The group sails down the river,
   hoping to find the answers that will enable them to free the children
   from Otherland's hold.
