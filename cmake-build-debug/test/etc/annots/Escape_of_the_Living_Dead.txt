   Set in 1971, 3 years after the events seen in Night of the Living Dead,
   the comic starts out with a raid by police officers led by Sheriff
   Harkness on a medical lab run by Dr. Melrose. During the raid the
   officers manage to shoot Dr. Melrose. Before he dies he reveals he had
   been experimenting on the zombies for a government funded project and
   tells the officers about his son who is taking over the project.

   Meanwhile, one of the main characters, Sally Brinkman, is talking to
   her father Henry. It is revealed Sally is staying with her parents
   whilst going through a divorce and is working for her father at the
   local saloon.

   Also, two robbers for the gang Sons of Satan attempt to rob a truck by
   pouring sugar in the gas tank, and then robbing its contents. When they
   look in the truck, they find it is full of zombies that proceed to
   attack and eat them. With the zombies released they start walking
   towards the town.

   The zombies eventually reach the Brinkman farm and kill Sally's mother.
   The zombies then try to attack Sally, but she manages to avoid them and
   ride a horse to the saloon where her Dad works. However, zombies have
   also attacked the saloon as well; Henry attempts to fight the zombies
   off but hides in the saloon just as Sally appears. They both hide in
   the saloon and lock the doors.

   Meanwhile, the rest of the Sons of Satan gang attempt to meet up with
   the robbers from before, only to encounter them now as zombies. The
   three gang members, Bearcat, Slam, and Honeybear, kill the zombies
   before driving off. They eventually reach the saloon, where they are
   surrounded by zombies. Sally and Henry notice this and let them in.

   Eventually, the zombies start to break in, and the bikers attempt to
   escape, kidnapping Sally and stealing a truck in the process, leaving
   Henry to be eaten. During this, one of the bikers, Honeybear, is
   killed, while Henry manages to avoid the zombies and get a truck to
   chase after the bikers.

   Meanwhile, the two bikers and Sally have taken refuge in the nearby
   woods. Sally is now tied up when zombies attack the trio. Although they
   fight off the zombies, Slam is bitten and, in panic, kills Bearcat. He
   then forces Sally to take him to her house to help him.

   At this time, Sheriff Harkness discovers the truck that the zombies
   were originally transported in; he concludes this was the operation
   that Dr. Melrose mentioned. At this point Henry shows up, and helps
   Sheriff Harkness decide to get a posse together to kill the zombies.

   Back at Sally's farm, Sally is forced to help Slam clean his wounds;
   she unsuccessfully tries to kill him with his knife and flees, but Slam
   chases after her as she runs into the basement. Slam then tries to kill
   her, but is killed by a hidden zombie. Sally runs outside to find her
   father and a posse killing the zombies.

   The posse then fight a horde of zombies, which attack them. Although
   outnumbered, the military show up and kill all the zombies. After the
   fight Sheriff Harkness gets a call on the radio, saying that the Dr.
   Melrose that they killed at the beginning did not match the dental
   records, and thus was an impostor.

   The last pages shows a lone zombie being captured by the real Dr.
   Melrose and his son, implying the zombie epidemic is far from over.
