   The story takes place in a near-future Britain where society has broken
   down due to an unspecified disaster, referred to as "The Crisis." The
   new society that emerges after the collapse retains many features of
   the old world but is fundamentally different. What serves as a
   government in the post-crisis nation is unable to consolidate its
   authority and exercises little control over the populace. Newscasts can
   be heard and law and order are upheld by vigilantes and a handful of
   policemen. Education exists for those who pass as the wealthier
   survivors, while schools for the poor act as an apparatus of the army
   and are designed to control the population. Limited commercial activity
   continues, but scavenging is required to obtain rare goods.

   By the start of the novel, the situation in the society is starting to
   deteriorate as the edifice of the past society crumbles. The narrator
   describes people moving out of the city, and empty shelves indicate a
   food shortage. Rationing is in effect, and gangs migrate through the
   city block by block attacking residents. Many of the narrator's
   neighbours want to move out of the city as the situation becomes worse.

   The narrator, a middle-aged woman who lives a quiet life in a flat,
   unexpectedly ends up with 'custody' of a teenage girl named Emily
   Cartwright and her dog Hugo. The narrator seeks to please the new
   arrival and works hard to ensure that Emily has a high opinion of her.
   She often comments on Emily's competence and neatness and ponders the
   purpose of the girl's existence. Emily herself is intelligent and
   insightful but is also quite distant. The narrator and Emily somewhat
   enjoy each other's company and seem to form a tacit arrangement of
   tolerance between them.

   This idyllic time (in the words of the narrator) ends when a gang of
   young people take up residence in the community. Emily goes out to meet
   them but retreats when they tease her and threaten Hugo. Later that
   evening she meets with the gang again, and this time enjoys herself.
   Upon returning home, she remarks to the narrator that the gang members
   are at least able to enjoy themselves. Many different gangs pass
   through the community in the next few months, and Emily always
   interacts with them. This, coupled with Emily's abrasive wit, creates
   friction between her and the narrator, though the latter weathers
   Emily's remarks and remains stoic.

   As Emily grows older, she exhibits more and more signs of adolescence.
   She designs her own clothes, gains then loses weight, and works
   ardently to become more attractive. As the story progresses, a group of
   similar minded young people from the community begin to form a gang of
   their own, modelled after the previous gangs that visited the
   community. Emily happily joins them in their nightly revelry. Soon it
   becomes apparent that the gang is going to depart from the community,
   and the narrator believes that Emily will leave with them. However,
   Emily is conflicted about leaving Hugo behind. She tries to introduce
   him to the gang, but no progress is made. The next day three of the
   gang members go to the flat where Emily and the narrator live with the
   intent to eat Hugo but are dissuaded by the presence of the Narrator.
   Emily learns of this occurrence and decides that, for the moment, she
   cannot leave her longtime companion behind. The gang soon splits into
   two groups, and Emily stays with the group that chooses not to depart.

   The story continues to progress as Emily grows older. Outside of the
   narrator's flat, society begins to revert to a pre-industrial state,
   with agriculture becoming more and more common in the city. A few
   blocks away, a young man named Gerald organizes dispossessed children
   into a new group and begins to establish a new gang. Emily becomes
   infatuated with Gerald, and it is implied that they form a physical
   relationship. Emily's influence in the community continues to grow, and
   she is soon seen as one of the leaders of the young people. One day the
   narrator returns home and finds items missing from her flat. Emily
   finds out about this thievery, and orders the thieves (who are some of
   the children that she leads) to return the stolen goods, displaying her
   authority over the children and her ability to protect the narrator,
   who up until this point had protected her. She then leads the narrator
   upstairs, where a thriving market has formed in the upper floors of the
   apartment building.

   Emboldened by his successes, Gerald continues to solidify his control
   over his group of followers. Emily often helps him, though friction is
   created between the two when Gerald seeks out other partners.
   Eventually, Gerald (who, according to the narrator, has too kind a
   heart) adopts feral children who had inhabited the sewers into his
   gang. However, the children are filthy and vicious, with their
   behaviour leading to the collapse of Gerald's formerly well-managed
   gang. The people of the community gather to discuss what should be done
   about the children when the police arrive and break up the meeting.
   Fearing that the eyes of the authorities (described as "them") have
   fallen upon the community, many of the narrator's neighbours flee in
   the following months.

   Months go by and society continues to collapse. The feral children are
   ostensibly under Gerald's control, but often run wild in what remains
   of the neighbourhood. Water is in short supply, caravans and traders
   are often attacked, and it is implied that even the government is
   starting to abandon parts of the city. Emily and the narrator spend
   most of their time in the flat and are able to interact with the
   children due to Emily's relationship with Gerald, but both fear an
   attack in the future, as the children are actively raiding and killing
   other humans at night. By this point, most of the residents of the
   neighbourhood have departed for the lands to the north and west of the
   city, lands from which there is forebodingly no news. Eventually, the
   children turn on Gerald and attack him, while he remains incredulous
   that such young children could betray him. Emily is able to save Gerald
   and hurry him into the flat. Faced with a bleak existence, the small
   group of Emily, Gerald, Hugo, and the Narrator fall asleep, expecting
   an attack from the children. The narrator awakes to find that the wall
   has opened before her and a new world lays on the other side. Emily
   leads the group through, whereupon they step into a new, better world
   as the walls dissolve away.

   Periodically, the narrator is able, through meditating on a certain
   wall (see above) in her flat, to traverse space and time. Many of these
   visions are about Emily's sad childhood under the care of her harsh
   mother and distant father. At the end of the novel, the main
   character's strange new family breaks through dimensional barriers via
   the wall and walks into a much better world.
