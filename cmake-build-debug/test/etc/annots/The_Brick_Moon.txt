   "The Brick Moon" is presented as a journal. It describes the
   construction and launch into orbit of a sphere, 200 feet in diameter,
   built of bricks. The device is intended as a navigational aid, but is
   accidentally launched with people aboard.^[1] They survive, and so the
   story also provides the first known fictional description^[1] of a
   space station. The author even correctly surmised the idea of needing
   four satellites visible above the horizon for navigation, as in
   modern-day GPS.
