   While leading the Dendarii Mercenaries on a hostage rescue mission,
   Miles Vorkosigan has a seizure -- a recurring consequence of his death
   and resuscitation in Mirror Dance -- which results in his accidentally
   severing the rescued hostage's legs with his plasma arc weapon.
   Terrified of the consequences if his boss, Simon Illyan, the head of
   Imperial Security (ImpSec), finds out, Miles falsifies his mission
   report. However, Illyan finds out anyway from spies planted among the
   Dendarii, and Miles is forced to accept a medical discharge.

   Miles enters a period of depression, isolating himself in the
   Vorkosigan mansion, which is deserted due to his parents' taking charge
   of the new colony on the planet Sergyar. His cousin Ivan Vorpatril is
   sent to check on him. He arrives with Captain Duv Galeni of Imperial
   Security, who encountered Miles during the events of Brothers in Arms.
   They plunge Miles into an ice bath and then bully him into breaking out
   of his funk. Ivan moves into Vorkosigan House to keep an eye on Miles.

   Miles goes to Emperor Gregor, to apologize formally for his failures as
   an ImpSec officer. Gregor then surprises him by inviting him to a
   meeting with a Komarran guest. After years of refusing to marry any of
   the tall, slim, eligible Barrayaran ladies paraded in front of him by
   Alys Vorpatril, Gregor unexpectedly falls in love with a short,
   voluptuous Komarran, Laisa Toscane, a wealthy heiress and member of a
   Komarran economic delegation. However, Duv Galeni also has designs on
   Laisa, being Komarran himself.

   When Illyan suffers a sudden, crippling mental impairment, Miles
   attempts to investigate, but he receives no cooperation from Lucas
   Haroche, ImpSec's acting chief, so he asks Gregor to assign an Imperial
   Auditor, a top-level troubleshooter with practically unlimited
   authority and answerable only to the Emperor. Gregor unexpectedly
   decides that it would save many steps (and his time) by making Miles
   himself a temporary Auditor. There are several problems, including the
   fact that Miles himself would be a suspect in any crime against Illyan.
   Duv Galeni also falls under suspicion due to his Komarran background,
   and his tirade against the Vor class when he heard that Laisa had
   agreed to marry Gregor. Duv is also the son of Ser Galen, a Komarran
   terrorist who was responsible for several plots against Barrayar,
   including the attempt to replace Miles Vorkosigan with a clone in
   Brothers in Arms.

   Illyan's breakdown seems to be caused by the artificial memory device
   implanted in his head when he was a young lieutenant. This was a whim
   of the then Emperor Ezar, Gregor's grandfather, who set Illyan to keep
   an eye on Aral Vorkosigan. The device begins dumping random memories
   into Illyan's brain, causing him to lose track of reality. After a
   horrific time standing watch over Illyan in the hospital, trying to
   keep him sane with help from Ivan and Alys, while a surgeon prepares to
   remove the device, Miles sets out to discover what caused the
   breakdown. He recruits the arrogant, brilliant "Dr. Waddell", formerly
   Hugh Canaba, whom he extracted from a bio-engineering facility on
   Jackson's Whole in the story Labyrinth. Waddell analyzes the extracted
   device and announces that the breakdown was caused by a synthetic
   biological agent from Jackson's Whole. Alerted by a false record in the
   log of ImpSec's store room that seemed to show him entering on a
   previous occasion, Miles assigns Ivan to inventory the contents and
   quickly finds that the agent came from the stores, having been
   confiscated from Ser Galen's organization. Someone in ImpSec was
   responsible, and was trying to frame Miles. Duv Galeni is arrested, but
   Miles thinks that is also a frame-up.

   After Miles unravels the devious crime in remarkably quick time, his
   appointment is made permanent. This inevitably means giving up the
   leadership of his Dendarii Mercenaries, leaving his second in command,
   and sometime lover, Elli Quinn, to take over.

   Miles, as Gregor's "Second", conducts the formal betrothal ceremony
   with Laisa. Illyan and Alys, meanwhile, have become secret lovers, to
   Ivan's dismay. Duv Galeni, freed from the cells at ImpSec, announces
   his engagement to Delia Koudelka. Miles undergoes surgery to implant a
   device that can be used to induce mild seizures as a palliative
   measure, the underlying condition being incurable. This becomes
   important in the next novel, Komarr.
