   While the US was involving itself into three different wars, Korean,
   Cold, and Second Red Scare, The Dial Press was publishing "Go Tell It
   On The Mountain" in 1953. Baldwin decided to use art, literature, and
   the culture expansion of his hometown of Harlem for inspiration for the
   novel, despite all of the day to day war mediums.  He applied the
   previous African American Great Migration to his character backgrounds
   and to allow for contrasting views. James Baldwin's Go Tell It on the
   Mountain also reflects elements of African-American folklore, similar
   to the ones found in West Africa. Things like sermons, music, and
   spirituality in the novel took inspiration from African-American
   culture, but also the Wolof ethnic group of West Africa. This parallel
   is seen as a interpretation to Baldwin's relationship with Africa.
