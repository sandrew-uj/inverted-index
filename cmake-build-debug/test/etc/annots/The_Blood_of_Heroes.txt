   In a barren world caused by wars waged in the 20th century and now
   forgotten, most live from hand to mouth in enclaves known as
   "market-towns" or "dog-towns", scrounging out a bare subsistence
   harvesting hardy crops, raising dogs as food, and trading in trinkets
   from the past.

   What little entertainment exists comes primarily from a brutal sport
   known as The Game. It is played by bands of roving teams known as
   juggs, who challenge local teams. They might be considered professional
   athletes, as they make their living through the tribute paid by the
   town people, should they defeat the local team. Their trophy is the dog
   skull from the town. The Game involves two armoured teams of five
   attempting to score by placing a dog skull on the opposing team's
   goalpost. One unarmed player--the "quick"--runs with the skull while
   being protected by his/her teammates from attack by the opposing team.

   However, not all in this time live so sparsely. The Nine Cities, buried
   deep underground, are home to affluent and powerful members of the
   aristocracy. Each of The Nine Cities fields its own team of juggs in an
   organization known as The League, and its membership is maintained with
   a fresh stream of new players who are proven veterans of the travelling
   "dog-town" games by their collection of trophy skulls.

   Members of The League live in luxury almost equal to that of
   aristocrats. It is a dream among roving juggs to be good enough to get
   The League's attention and, with it, all of the luxuries afforded a
   League player.

   The team consists of Sallow (Rutger Hauer), Dog-Boy (Justin Monjo),
   Mbulu (Delroy Lindo), Big Cimber (Anna Katarina), and Young Gar
   (Vincent D'Onofrio).

   Sallow, the team leader, has played in the League of the Nine Cities
   before, but was cast out because of his indiscretions with an
   Overlord's daughter. Kidda (Joan Chen), an ambitious peasant girl,
   joins the team after a game in her dog town where she virtually
   destroyed her competition. She and Gar inspire Sallow to challenge The
   League and expunge his past.

   But Kidda and Gar do not realise that the City games are for much more
   than honour and victory, they will need to fight for their very
   survival. The Game is played much harder and meaner in the Nine Cities.
