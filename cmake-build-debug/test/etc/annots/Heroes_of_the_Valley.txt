   Halli Sveinsson loves to hear stories from the days when the valley was
   a wild and dangerous place, besieged by the bloodthirsty Trow. Now
   farming has taken over from fighting Trows, and to Halli's
   disappointment, heroics seem a thing of the past. But when a practical
   joke rekindles an old blood feud, he sees a chance for a daring quest
   of his own.

   The tale begins with the Battle of the Rock being told to a child. This
   was when twelve heroes of the valley joined together to fight the
   ruthless Trows (man eating monsters) who were devastating the land.
   Taking up positions on a large rock, they were finally attacked at dusk
   by the Trows, who they fended off all night. In the morning, when the
   people returned to see what had happened, all were dead, Trows and
   Heroes, including Svein, their leader.

   The heroes were buried under cairns along the borders of the valley
   with their swords, so that, even in death, they could guard the
   boundaries from the Trows. As long as no one crosses the cairn border,
   the legends say, no Trows can enter the Valley.

   Many years later, Halli is born. He is a very short, stout, and
   headstrong boy who longs for the days of the Heroes, when a man could
   fight for what he wanted and take what he could win. He longs to leave
   the valley, which is now ruled by a Council of women who demand peace
   and equality in the land. They have outlawed swords and other weapons
   to discourage wars. Halli looks very much like his uncle Brodir, whom
   he adores. He is the third and last child in his family, who are
   Arnkel, his father and Arbiter of Svein's House, Astrid, his mother and
   Law-Giver of Svein's House, Leif, his older brother who is immediately
   in line for the Arbiter after Arnkel, Gudny, his sister and Brodir, who
   is the only relative who seems to get along with him.

   When his uncle is murdered by the rival house of Hakonssons, Halli sets
   off to avenge him. Finally, he thinks that he will have a hero's quest
   of his own.

   But during his journey, Halli realizes that he isn't the pitiless
   avenging killer that he thought he could be. His interference and
   thirst for revenge leads two men to their deaths, and he becomes sick
   with guilt. He returns home to his relieved yet angry family, and his
   distrusting and fearful fellow villagers. His actions eventually lead
   to an attack by the House of Hakon, and he alone can accept
   responsibility and take charge of his defenseless village.

   The enemy arrives and they have an obvious advantage--swords. Halli
   realizes that his peoples' only hope is if he lures the enemy in the
   dark past the cairn boundaries. He does so with the help of his friend,
   Aud Arnsdottir, and to his relief, it works. The Hakonssons are eaten
   by monsters in the moorlands. However, Halli and Aud also come under
   attack. Much like the heroes of old, they take their last stand on a
   large rock and await the unseen monsters.
