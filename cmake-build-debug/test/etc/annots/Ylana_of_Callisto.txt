   The storyline begins during events covered in the previous volume in
   the series, Lankar of Callisto, in which most of the evil Mind Wizards
   threatening the Jovian moon of Callisto, or Thanator, were wiped out in
   the climactic battle. One last survivor of the villainous band seizes
   as hostages Ylana the jungle girl and her lover Tomar, and flees to
   take refuge with the Cave People, a tribe dominated by his race.

   Together with Ylana's father, lately deposed as chief of the tribe, the
   two captives escape and head for the territory of the rival River
   People, pursued by a hunting party. Ylana is kidnapped by a River
   faction intent on fomenting war between the tribes, but the eventual
   conflict is limited to young malcontents from both, strengthening the
   power of the traditional authorities.

   The threat of the Mind Wizard is ended when he is devoured by a
   plesiosaur, and all ends happily for Ylana and Tomar.
