   Pfeffer's novel Life As We Knew It was created after watching the
   original film Meteor (1979), noting that "it got  thinking about
   how the people who have the most to lose if the world comes to an end
   are kids," and wanted to see how her characters would cope with a
   situation that was out of their control. The Dead and the Gone occurs
   at the same time as the first novel, Life As We Knew It, but in New
   York City. She playfully mentioned that "I figure with 300 million
   people alive in the United States, even if I write about 10 people a
   book, I can still get another 2,999,998 novels out of that meteor, and
   that should keep me busy and entertained well past the foreseeable
   future."

   The Dead and the Gone uses a third-person narrative, while the previous
   book, Life As We Knew It, used a first-person narrative in a journal
   format. Asked about the change in narrative, Pfeffer replied quite
   simply that in her planning processes, she "just could not envision a
   teenage boy keeping a diary. It's as simple as that," accounting for
   the change.
