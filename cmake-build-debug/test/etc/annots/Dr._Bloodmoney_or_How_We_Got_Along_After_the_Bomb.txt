   Dr. Bloodmoney is set in a post-apocalyptic future. In 1972, before the
   start of the narrative, Dr. Bruno Bluthgeld (German for "Blood-Money")
   had led a project testing nuclear weapons as a protectionary measure
   against Communist China and the Soviet Union. However, a miscalculation
   caused an atmospheric nuclear accident leading to widespread fallout
   and mutations. More recently the United States has been involved in a
   prolonged period of hostilities with China and the Soviet Union
   erupting in a war in Cuba.

   In 1981, the now universally hated Bluthgeld seeks psychotherapy with
   Dr. Stockstill for his paranoia and guilt. Meanwhile, Stuart McConchie,
   Hoppy Harrington and Jim Fergesson, employees at Modern TV Sales and
   Service in Berkeley, California, go through a fairly typical day,
   pausing to watch Walt and Lydia Dangerfield being launched into orbit
   in the first stage of a colonization mission to Mars. This ordinary
   day, however, is disrupted by a massive nuclear strike. Orbiting
   overhead, Walt Dangerfield witnesses the tragic events as they unfold,
   while other characters are reduced to desperate measures in their
   struggle for survival. Fergesson is killed as his shop collapses.
   Meanwhile, Bluthgeld is convinced that he caused the strike in response
   to a universal conspiracy against him. Believing that he has shown the
   world his power, he sets out to heal and restore order through his
   imagined magical powers.

   The narrative jumps to 1988, when many communities have begun to
   rebuild a sort of order. A military government has arisen in Cheyenne,
   Wyoming, while in California government is by local community councils
   that view one another with varying degrees of hostility. Most pre-war
   technologies and amenities have been lost. Oil shortages result in
   disabled cars being pulled by horses or fitted with wood-burning
   (steam) engines. Former California ranch territory has been converted
   into agricultural land for corn and other crops. Human mutants have
   become more common, such as phocomeli, as well as conjoined symbiotes.
   At the same time, former domestic animals like dogs and cats have
   undergone mutations that have greatly enhanced their intelligence. Many
   of these former pets and zoo specimens have allied themselves into
   ferocious tribal units of their own. Bruno Bluthgeld's dog Terry is
   capable of imitating simple human speech, while some species of felines
   may have developed their own evolved languages.

   Walt Dangerfield, supplied with enough rations to last him for at least
   several more years, as well as a vast treasury of books and musical
   recordings, has become a disc jockey in orbit. His broadcasts help
   provide some sense of continuity with pre-war civilization in the
   isolated settlements that comprise the postwar world. His wife Lydia
   committed suicide at some point during the intervening period.
   Dangerfield has begun to experience symptoms of an unknown medical
   condition, causing some of his listeners to worry.

   In Marin County survivors including Bonny Keller, Dr. Stockstill, June
   Raub and Hoppy Harrington have organized into a self-governing
   community. Harrington, a Thalidomide baby missing all four of his
   limbs, harbors a quietly smoldering resentment of the patronizing and
   condescending attitudes he endured before the war. He has now become a
   successful mechanic thanks to electronic servo-mechanism technology as
   well as his gradually increasing abilities of psychokinesis or
   mind-over-matter. As such, he becomes a genuinely respected and
   absolutely indispensable member of the community. His ultimate goal,
   however, is to dominate and humiliate the people within his community
   through intimidation via his increasingly capricious and violent misuse
   of his ever-strengthening powers. He's been using his talents to
   gradually weaken Walt Dangerfield in order to take over Dangerfield's
   much-beloved satellite transmissions. Meanwhile, Bluthgeld, under the
   assumed name of Jack Tree, lives as a sheep farmer outside the
   community. One outsider searching for the infamous Bluthgeld was
   exposed by Bonny Keller and summarily executed for his troubles.

   Stuart McConchie has become a travelling entrepreneur in the
   post-apocalyptic world, selling "smart" robotic rat traps for a company
   based in post-war Berkeley. Still holding onto his ambitious pre-war
   salesman's mentality, McConchie travels to Marin County to meet Andrew
   Gill, a cigarette and alcohol entrepreneur, to discuss the
   re-introduction of automation within his factory as an agent of
   Berkeley-based business interests. His appearance in West Marin
   startles Hoppy Harrington and Bruno Bluthgeld, both of whom had last
   seen McConchie on the day of the "Emergency".

   Bluthgeld's increasing psychosis eventually leads to the discovery of
   his identity. His magical powers, however, do not appear to be entirely
   imaginary. In his ardent desire to silence the talking satellite he
   seems to initiate another series of atmospheric explosions merely by
   willing them to occur. Hoppy, viewing him as a potential rival as well
   as a direct threat to the community and the planet itself, kills him
   from several miles away. Harrington employs his own psychokinetic
   powers in flinging the mad scientist high into the air and then simply
   letting him fall back to the ground. The Marin County council decides
   to thank Hoppy by presenting him with gifts of Gill's tobacco, alcohol
   and a monument in Harrington's honor, but Hoppy scorns these gifts as
   being much less than he deserves. Bonny Keller begins to worry that
   Hoppy will set himself up as a vindictive little tin god, and so she
   flees the county with Gill and McConchie in hopes of eventually
   settling beyond the reach of his powers.

   Meanwhile, Edie Keller's conjoined twin brother Bill, a sentient fetus
   within her body, has been yearning for an independent existence. Bill
   Keller is able to communicate telepathically with the dead, and they
   warn him how dangerous Hoppy is becoming. When Edie approaches Hoppy's
   house, Harrington uses his powers to draw Bill outside of her in hopes
   of causing him to perish. Little Bill has a near-lethal adventure
   inside of an owl before finally engineering a body-swap with Hoppy
   which quickly proves fatal to Harrington. The idol with feet of clay
   has finally been toppled.

   At the conclusion of the book, Dr. Stockstill begins a course of
   psychotherapy, broadcast over the radio, with Walt Dangerfield, who
   seems to be slowly recovering from his illness in the absence of a
   jealous Hoppy Harrington's debilitating mental emanations.
