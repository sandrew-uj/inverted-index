   The novel revolves around two main characters: Anthony Malone, a young
   man from the Midwest who leaves behind his straight life as a lawyer to
   immerse himself in the gay life of 1970s New York, and Andrew
   Sutherland, variously described as a speed addict, a socialite, and a
   drag queen. Their social life includes long nights of drinking,
   dancing, and drug use in New York's gay bars. Though they enjoy many
   physical pleasures, their lives lack any spiritual depth. The "dance"
   of the novel's title becomes a metaphor for their lives. Malone is
   described as preternaturally beautiful; much of the plot concerns
   Sutherland's efforts to leverage Malone's beauty by "marrying" him to a
   young millionaire.

   The book switches perspective often. Sometimes characters are tracked
   closely using more traditional omniscient narrative techniques. On
   other occasions (especially later in the book), the lives of Malone and
   Sutherland are seen from the perspective of bystanders in the New York
   gay scene -- the book itself is literally written by the other dancers
   at the dance.
