   In 1982, a shady transaction is occurring between an East German
   scientist, Dr. Krause, and a group of Americans involving a substance
   known as MM88. MM88 is a deadly virus, created accidentally by an
   American geneticist, that amplifies the potency of any other virus or
   bacterium it comes into contact with. The Americans recover the virus
   sample, which was stolen from a lab in the US the year before, but the
   virus is accidentally released after the plane transporting it crashes,
   creating a pandemic initially known as the "Italian Flu".

   Within seven months, virtually all the world's population has died off.
   However, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees
   Celsius, and the polar winter has spared the 855 men and eight women
   stationed in Antarctica. The British nuclear submarine HMS Nereid joins
   the scientists after sinking a Soviet submarine whose infected crew
   attempts to make landfall near Palmer Station.

   Several years later, as the group is beginning to repopulate their new
   home, it is discovered that an earthquake will activate the Automated
   Reaction System (ARS) and launch the United States nuclear arsenal.

   The Soviets have their own version of the ARS that will fire off their
   weapons in return, including one targeting Palmer Station. After all of
   the women and children and several hundred of the men are sent to
   safety aboard an icebreaker, Yoshizumi and Major Carter embark aboard
   the Nereid on a mission to shut down the ARS, protected from MM88 by an
   experimental vaccine.

   The submarine arrives at Washington, D.C., and Yoshizumi and Carter
   make a rush for the ARS command bunker. However, they reach the room
   too late, and Carter dies in the rubble of the earthquake, deep in the
   bunker. Yoshizumi contacts the Nereid and tells them to try to save
   themselves, adding that the vaccine seems to have worked "If that still
   matters". "At this point in time, life still matters," the captain
   replies, telling Yoshizumi to stay where he is: He might be safe.

   Washington is hit by a bomb, and the screen fills with atomic bomb
   after atomic bomb exploding. From there the movie's ending diverges
   based upon the two cuts. In the American version, the screen goes black
   for a moment, and the end credits roll over footage of the Antarctic
   and a poignant song sung by a lone woman's voice. The refrain is, "It's
   not too late..." In the Japanese version, Yoshizumi survives the blast
   and walks back towards Antarctica. Upon reaching Tierra del Fuego in
   1988, he finds survivors from the icebreaker, immunized by a
   since-developed vaccine. They embrace, and Yoshizumi declares "Life is
   wonderful."
