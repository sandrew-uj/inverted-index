   The novel concerns the coming together of six extraordinary people with
   strange powers who are able to "blesh" (a portmanteau of "blend" and
   "mesh") their abilities together. In this way, they are able to act as
   one organism. They progress toward a mature gestalt consciousness,
   called the homo gestalt, the next step in the human evolution.
