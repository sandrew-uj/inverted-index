   In Toronto, a group of friends and family prepare for the end of the
   world, expected at midnight as the result of a calamity that is not
   explained, but which has been expected for several months. There has
   been panic and rioting after the imminent catastrophe was announced,
   but the chaos has since largely died down, with only sporadic murders,
   robberies, and vandalisms. On the last evening, Sandra's car was
   vandalized by passersby while she scavenges leftover in a supermarket
   leaving her stranded. Meanwhile, Patrick meets with his extended family
   for a mock Christmas dinner celebration; Duncan, husband of Sandra,
   spends much of the day calling his customers to reassure them that
   their heating gas will be kept on until the very end; Craig is having
   sex with Lily.

   Patrick left the dinner prematurely to spend his final hours alone in
   his apartment. However, he unexpectedly meets Sandra at the front door
   of his apartment. After Sandra's constant request, Patrick reluctantly
   let Sandra to visit his apartment and use his phone to contact Duncan.
   Patrick then suggests Sandra to steal a car as Sandra leave his
   apartment. Meanwhile, Craig and Mrs. Carlton are having sex, and Donna
   turn up the music and let go of herself in the power company after
   Duncan left.

   Patrick meets his high school friend Menzies who is driving around to
   dispatch tickets of his concert with his cousin while Patrick and
   Sandra are trying to hitchhike. Patrick later convinced Craig to borrow
   his car in Craig's apartment despite the Craig's reluctant. After
   Sandra left, Craig tries to convince Patrick to enjoy sex in the final
   hours and revealed his fantasy of experiencing sex using various
   methods and with various partners. Craig later tells Patrick that he is
   not belittling Patrick, but to inspire him to enjoy his final hours.
   While leaving Craig's apartment, Craig attempts to have a homosexual
   affair with Patrick, but Patrick refused despite that he loves Craig.

   In the final hour, Duncan opens the door upon hearing a gunshot on the
   street only to be held hostage by Marty; in the concert that only a few
   people attended, Mrs. Carlton quietly walk into the concert while
   Menzies play the piano on the stage. Sandra is stopped by a group of
   protestors who blocked the traffic and vandalized the car. Sandra
   therefore returned to Patrick's apartment. Using Patrick's phone,
   Sandra listens to Duncan's voicemail that was used to reassure their
   customer as a power company repeatedly. Upon realizing she will not
   reunite with Duncan, Sandra asks Patrick to join her suicide pact which
   she had with Duncan. Patrick refused the suicide pact stating that he
   needs to know her more to consider it, so they shared their stories,
   slowly progressing into serious topic: Patrick's lost loved one.

   As the midnight approaches, Craig meets with Donna and find it
   difficult to believe that she is a virgin. Donna find herself ashamed
   but Craig successfully turn the situation around and have sex with her.
   While Patrick and Sandra make their final attempt to contact Duncan, it
   was revealed that Duncan was killed. Patrick and Sandra both sit on the
   roof facing each other, listening to the song "Guantanamera," each
   holding a loaded pistol to the other's temple. However, as the final
   seconds approach, both characters are overcome with emotion and
   simultaneously let their pistols slip away as they slowly embrace in a
   kiss.
