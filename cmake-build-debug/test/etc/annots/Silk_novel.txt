   The novel tells the story of a French silkworm merchant-turned-smuggler
   named Herve Joncour in 19th century France who travels to Japan for his
   town's supply of silkworms after a disease wipes out their African
   supply. His first trip to Japan takes place in the Bakumatsu period,
   when Japan was still largely closed to foreigners. During his stay in
   Japan, he becomes obsessed with the concubine of a local baron. His
   trade in Japan and his personal relationship with the concubine are
   both strained by the internal political turmoil and growing
   anti-Western sentiment in Japan that followed the arrival of Matthew C.
   Perry in Endo Bay.
