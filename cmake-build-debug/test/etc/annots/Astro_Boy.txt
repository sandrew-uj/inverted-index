   Astro Boy is a science fiction series set in a futuristic world where
   robots co-exist with humans. Its focus is on the adventures of the
   titular "Astro Boy" (sometimes called simply "Astro"): a powerful
   android created by the head of the Ministry of Science, Doctor Tenma
   (known as Dr. Astor Boynton II in the 1960s English dub; Dr. Boynton in
   the 1980s English dub). Dr. Tenma created Astro to replace his son
   Tobio ('Astor' in the 1960s English dub; 'Toby' in the 1980s English
   dub and the 2009 film), who was killed in a self-driving traffic
   collision (first ran away, then was killed in the accident in the 2003
   anime; vaporized by the Peacekeeper in the 2009 film). Dr. Tenma built
   and adopted Astro in Tobio's memory and treated Astro as lovingly as if
   he was the real Tobio. However, Dr. Tenma soon realized that the little
   android could not fill the void of his lost son, especially given that
   Astro could not grow older or express human aesthetics (in one set of
   panels in the manga, Astro is shown preferring the mechanical shapes of
   cubes over the organic shapes of flowers). In the original 1960
   edition, Tenma rejected Astro and sold him to a cruel circus owner,
   Hamegg (the Great Cacciatore in the '60 English dub). In the 1980
   edition, Hamegg kidnapped Astro while Tenma was trying to find him. In
   the 2009 film, Tenma rejected Astro part-time because he could not stop
   thinking about his original son, but later during the film, Tenma
   realized that Astro made credit to replace Tobio; as a result, Tenma
   decided that he would readopt Astro. None these events about Astro
   being rejected (completely or temporarily) or kidnapped in both the
   1960 and 1980 cartoons as well as in the 2009 film happened in the 2003
   cartoon as Astro's birth was given by Professor Ochanomizu (Dr. Elefun
   in the 1960 and 1980 cartoons, as well as in the 2009 film; Dr. O'Shay
   in the 2003 cartoon).

   After some time, Professor Ochanomizu, the new head of the Ministry of
   Science (co-head of the Ministry of Science in the 2009 film), notices
   Astro Boy performing in the circus and convinces Hamegg to turn Astro
   over to him. (In a retcon the story becomes far more violent and
   complicated). He then takes Astro in as his own and treats him gently
   and warmly, becoming his legal guardian. He soon realizes that Astro
   has superior powers and skills, as well as the ability to experience
   human emotions.

   Astro then is shown fighting crime, evil, and injustice using his seven
   powers: 100K horsepower strength, jet flight, high intensity lights in
   his eyes, adjustable hearing, instant language translation, a
   retractable machine gun in his hips, and a high IQ capable of
   determining if a person is good or evil. Most of his enemies are
   robot-hating humans, robots gone berserk, or alien invaders. Almost
   every story includes a battle involving Astro and other robots. In one
   manga episode, Astro takes on the US Air Force, and stops it from
   bombing some innocent Vietnamese villagers (this was a time-travel
   episode, in which Astro went back from the 21st century to 1969).
