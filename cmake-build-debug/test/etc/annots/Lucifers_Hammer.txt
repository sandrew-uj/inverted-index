   When wealthy soap company heir and amateur astronomer Tim Hamner
   co-discovers a new comet, dubbed Hamner-Brown, the documentary producer
   Harvey Randall persuades Hamner to have his family's company sponsor a
   television documentary series on the subject. Political lobbying by
   California Senator Arthur Jellison eventually gets a joint Apollo-Soyuz
   (docking with Skylab B) mission into space to study the comet, dubbed
   "The Hammer" by popular media, which is expected to pass close to the
   Earth.

   Despite the scientific community repeatedly assuring the public that a
   collision with Earth is extremely unlikely, pieces of the comet's
   nucleus impact across the Western Hemisphere, with devastating results.
   The strikes on parts of Europe, Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, and the
   Pacific and Atlantic Oceans set off volcanoes, destabilize fault lines,
   including the San Andreas Fault, and cause tsunamis thousands of meters
   high, destroying major coastal cities around the world, killing
   billions and initiating long-term climate problems because of the
   massive quantities of vaporized seawater in the atmosphere.

   Immediately after the strike, China, anticipating the coming ice age
   launches a preemptive nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. The last
   Soviet premier reassures the US that it is not the target, and he
   requests help against the unprovoked attack.

   Jellison's ranch forms the center post of a fiefdom in the Sierra
   foothills, dubbed "the Stronghold," where he presides over a small
   population of survivors, including Randall and Hamner, who struggle to
   maintain civilization.

   Shortwave radio, the only surviving means of mass communication, is
   eagerly monitored and reveals a chaotic situation after the Fall.
   Several people, including some who had been officials of the former US
   government, claim to be the new or currently acting US President, but
   others are now self-proclaimed monarchs of various regions or areas.
   Many people subsist by looting former stores and by catching rats and
   various fish, especially the now-plentiful giant carp, which are mostly
   either former pet goldfish or their progeny, engorged by the massive
   supply of food available to them, primarily in the form of human and
   animal corpses. Some advanced technical knowledge was maintained by the
   means of the preservation of a collection of books, which had been
   wrapped in impermeable plastic and submerged in a septic tank shortly
   after Hammerfall and later retrieved by a JPL scientist, who realized
   their potential value and likely scarcity in a post-Hammer world.

   Reverend Henry Armitage manages to take control of a cannibalistic
   group of petty thieves and the remnants of a former US Army unit,
   integrating them into his pre-existing band of followers, the New
   Brotherhood Army. The Reverend's forces begin a rampage through the
   area, culminating in a series of battles with the inhabitants of the
   Stronghold. Jellison's force prevails with the help of chemical
   weapons, saving the Stronghold and also defending a nuclear power plant
   nearby, thus preserving a supply of electric power that is needed to
   rebuild civilization.
