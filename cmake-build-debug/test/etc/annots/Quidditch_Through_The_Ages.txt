   In 2001, Rowling penned two companion books to the Harry Potter series,
   Quidditch Through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,
   for British charity and offshoot of Live Aid, Comic Relief^[1] with all
   of her royalties going to the charity. As of July 2008, the books
   combined are estimated to have earned over $30 million for Comic
   Relief.^[2] The two books have since been made available in hardcover.
