   The narrative begins on a hillside, where the protagonist, Danny Lodge,
   encounters a man in a radiation suit, who confiscates his bike and
   orders him to return to his home town, the fictional Yorkshire town of
   Skipley. Arriving there, Danny finds the town in ruins, and learns that
   his family's shop has collapsed, killing his mother. His brother Ben
   and their father have survived, as they were in the cellar, which is
   used as a stockroom. With so much food in their stockroom, the Lodges
   have plenty to live on, but as the weeks pass, other people begin
   fighting over food. Shortly after the war, Danny meets a girl named
   Kim.

   The local Commissioner issues an order that the injured and infirm are
   to be taken out of the town and placed at the roadside so they can be
   taken to hospital: this turns out to be front for his secret plan to
   kill off those who will be a burden. After a while, the Commissioner
   implements a system of food and fuel rationing, with severe penalties
   introduced for hoarding. The injured, elderly, and people who have been
   emotionally traumatised by the nuclear attack are given poisoned
   rations. Mr Lodge refuses to allow his stock to be used for this
   purpose and, though Danny and Ben register for ration cards, they only
   visit the local feeding centre once.

   Presently, the Commissioner's men come to the shop and arrest Mr Lodge.
   The lorry bearing Mr Lodge explodes, killing everyone on board, and
   leaving Danny and Ben orphans. The brothers seek sanctuary at the home
   of Sam Branwell, a smallholder who, along with several other survivors,
   has formed a resistance movement called Masada, an acronym for
   "Movement to Arm Skipley Against Dictational Authority" and an allusion
   to the historic siege. Masada has the aim of overthrowing the
   Commissioner and preventing the creation of a feudal society; its other
   members include Keith Rhodes (who was responsible for blowing up the
   lorry), Danny's former P.E. teacher, and Kim.

   The protagonists discover that a concentration camp has been erected on
   a farm outside of Skipley, with the remaining able-bodied population
   being used as slave labour under the Commissioner's rule. Members of
   Masada decide to step up their campaign of resistance, and launch a
   night raid on the camp. After a battle, the Commissioner is overthrown
   and Branwell is established as the new leader.

   In the months after the raid, all the newly planted crops fail due to
   radiation damage. Kim's sister Maureen has become pregnant, and Kim is
   worried that the baby may be deformed; ultimately, the child is born
   without a mouth, and dies not long afterwards.

   Foreign troops arrive by helicopter, revealing there to be survivor
   communities all over Europe. Believing the Swiss troops will rescue
   them, the camp foolishly eat many of their rations. In fact, the Swiss
   confiscate their weapons and disable the few vehicles they have. By
   now, the camp's food supplies are exhausted, forcing the people to
   scavenge for whatever they can find, and many are dying. Gradually,
   people start to leave in small groups to fend for themselves. Shortly
   after Branwell dies from exhaustion during the second winter after the
   war, Danny, Kim and Ben leave the camp and head to Holy Island, where
   Danny hopes they will be safe.

   During the journey to Holy Island, they encounter a group on
   motorbikes, including Rhodes. Kim shoots Rhodes and another biker as
   they are about to shoot Danny in order to steal his food.

   Ben gradually becomes ill and dies of acute radiation syndrome: Danny
   and Kim bury his body in the garden of an empty house. Inside the
   house, Danny finds a ledger, and starts writing an account of his
   experiences after the war. He ends by saying that he plans to leave his
   account behind for future generations to read, hoping it will warn them
   not to go down the path which led to nuclear war. Finally, Danny
   dedicates his story to Ben, his "brother in the land".

   In 1994, the book was reprinted with an additional, final chapter. In
   this revised ending, Ben still dies, but, rather than leave his account
   behind, Danny takes the ledger with him to Holy Island. Kim is
   expecting a baby, the fourth of Holy Island, with Danny being the
   father. If the baby survives, it will be named after Ben.
