   Out-of-work former cavalryman and tank inspector Captain Richard is
   offered a job interview with a "catch" by a former comrade, Twinnings:
   namely, he suggests a morally questionable position with Giacomo
   Zapparoni, whose firm builds advanced robots; occasionally one of his
   engineers deserts, and he needs a man to "take care of" the problem to
   protect company secrets. At this point a reluctant Richard offers the
   first of many essayistic narrative asides, as he outlines the social
   magnitude of Zapparoni's creations, and the first of many
   autobiographical flashbacks, recounting his days in Military Academy
   under the guidance of his strict yet caring instructor, Monteron.

   Two days later, while nervously awaiting Zapparoni, Richard notices how
   Zapparoni's modest house appears strangely old-fashioned for a man who
   made his vast fortune in robotics. This tension between new and old
   prompts Richard to nostalgically reflect upon the historic demise of
   cavalry, supplanted by mechanized modern warfare.^[4]^[5] The suicide
   of his comrade Lorenz, who refused to adapt to the vertiginous pace of
   technological, social change, figures prominently in his reflection;
   for Richard, Lorenz's death exemplifies the fate of those who cannot
   "find firm ground under [their] feet in the present".^[6] Richard's
   ruminations then turn inward, as he narrates his own lack of worldly
   success and his negative evaluations by superiors as an "outsider with
   defeatist inclinations."^[7]

   When the elderly Zapparoni finally makes his entrance, Richard senses
   his latent power, remarking that there is more to him than his
   intelligence.^[8] In a narrative aside prompted by a question from
   Zapparoni, Richard contrasts his former comrades Fillmor, Lorenz, and
   Twinnings. Unlike either Lorenz and Twinnings, Fillmor, now a
   successful high officer, is driven entirely by ambition, yet totally
   lacks imagination. So when Zapparoni asks Richard for his opinion on
   Fillmor's memoir, Richard is unsure how to respond. Over the course of
   a tactical conversation, Zapparoni begins with familiar territory for
   Richard, namely war, yet is quickly able to master the discussion,
   forcing Richard into contortions and self-contradictions. Zapparoni
   then announces that he has other matters to attend to, and asks Richard
   to wait for him in the garden, warning him to beware of the bees.^[9]

   Out in the garden Richard, through a pair of sophisticated binoculars,
   discovers the glass bees. Watching them, he observes how these robotic
   bees are much more efficient at gathering nectar than real bees, and
   marvels at their construction. As he watches the bees, he notices a
   pond filled with severed ears. Richard briefly considers contacting the
   police but realizes that the powerful Zapparoni could easily frame
   him.^[10]

   Richard's predicament spurs a childhood reminiscence about Atje
   Hanebut, "chief" of Richard's neighborhood gang. One day, Atje has them
   savagely beat a member of a rival gang. Richard tries to stop Atje,
   calling his attention to the boy's bleeding nose, for which Atje has
   the boys beat Richard, after which they flee.^[11] The rival gang then
   finds Richard, beating him further in retaliation. Finally at home,
   Richard is beaten once more, this time by his father.

   Leaving the garden, Richard encounters Zapparoni, who reveals that the
   ears had been severed from humanoid robots, and were a test that
   Richard has unfortunately failed. Zapparoni then surprises Richard by
   offering him a different job requiring sharp moral discrimination,
   which Richard accepts. On the way home, Richard buys Teresa a red
   dress, they go out for dinner, and Richard begins to forget the events
   in Zapparoni's garden.
