   Schaine Madduc returns to Koryphon from school off-world, met by her
   brother Kelse. They and Gerd Jemasze are to meet their father, Uther,
   who has said he just learned something that is a splendid joke. An
   acquaintance, Elvo Glissam agrees to visit Uaia with them. However,
   Uther is ambushed and killed by Retent Uldras. Schaine, Kelse, Gerd,
   and Glissam survive a similar ambush and reach the Madducs' domain
   Morningswake.

   Uther Madduc was exploring the Palga plateau before he was killed.
   Gerd, Glissam, and the Madducs' Uldra foreman Kurgech go into the Palga
   to discover what he found. After various encounters with the
   Wind-runners, they find the secret: an ancient temple built by Erjins,
   who are in fact fully sentient.

   They return to Morningswake to learn that the Mull, the seat of
   government on the island continent of Szintarre, has ordered the land
   barons to give up their domains. The land barons defy this decree, and
   form their own Order of Uaia. The Uldra leader Jorjol, a childhood
   friend of the Madducs and the so-called Gray Prince, incites several
   hundred Retent Uldras to invade Morningswake. This attack is defeated
   by the Order's militia.

   A committee of the Mull arrives at Morningswake. Gerd escorts them to
   the Erjin temple, where he explains the first part of Uther Madduc's
   joke. The Mull has demanded that the land barons yield to the claim of
   the Uldras, who were there first. But the temple shows that the Erjins
   are sentient, which makes the Szintarrese slaveowners.

   Near the temple is the depot from which tamed Erjins are shipped. There
   they discover that the Erjin mounts and servitors exported by the
   Wind-runners are actually warriors, who at that very same moment are
   uprising and destroying their supposed masters. Erjin "servitors" seize
   control of Szintarre from its effete inhabitants. Erjin "mounts" turn
   on their Retent Uldra riders, but the combative Uldras defeat them. The
   Order of Uaia's militia (including Submission Uldras) fly south and
   defeat the Erjins in Szintarre. Returning to Uaia, they defeat a second
   and larger Uldra attack incited by Jorjol.

   This experience chastens some of the Szintarrese reformers, but the
   others persist in their campaign. Now Gerd Jemasze reveals the rest of
   Uther Madduc's joke. The temple shows that the Erjins were there before
   the Uldras, so they have an even better claim to the land. Furthermore,
   the temple's decorations depict Erjins arriving in spaceships and in
   combat with the semi-intelligent Morphotes: the Morphotes are in fact
   the original inhabitants of Koryphon and "rightful" claimants to the
   land.

   Gerd, speaking for the land barons, tells the Szintarrese that to be
   consistent they should either revoke their decree against the land
   barons, or else give their own country to the Morphotes as well.
