   The Edge Chronicles is a children's fantasy novel series^[1] by Paul
   Stewart and Chris Riddell.^[2] It consists of four trilogies, plus four
   additional books, and other books related to the universe (The
   Edge).^[3] The series was originally published by Doubleday, a
   subsidiary of Penguin Random House,^[4] and has sold more than three
   million copies, according to its publisher.^[5]

   The stories of The Edge Chronicles take place in the fictional world of
   The Edge, a vast cliff with no apparent bottom.^[6] The majority of
   books are grouped into sagas, with each saga focusing on one
   character.^[3] The series covers a 600-year period, divided into three
   "Ages of Flight". In The first age, floating rocks were used to stay
   airborne but then stone sickness, which made the rocks crumble, hit.
   Then, floating wood was used, and finally phrax-power. The power of
   flight is a major theme of the books, with each age defined by the
   current technology used for air travel.^[7] The series is notable for
   its flora and fauna, along with the maps of various locations in The
   Edge.^[6]

   The first three trilogies were released over the course of 1998 to
   2006, with a standalone saga serving as a conclusion to the first two
   ages of flight and a beginning to the third released in 2009.^[3] The
   series was planned to end after the tenth book,^[8] with the author's
   blog, Weird New Worlds serving as the continuous adventures with weekly
   'chapter' installments.^[9] After the completion of the 66 chapters of
   the blog, the authors decided to revisit the series with the fourth
   trilogy which would adapt the characters and stories from the blog,
   with the first and second books released in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
   The series also includes a number of short stories, along with a
   companion book.^[citation needed]
