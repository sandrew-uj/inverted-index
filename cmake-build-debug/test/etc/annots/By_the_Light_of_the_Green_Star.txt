   As Karn ponders on how to get past Klygon (who Gurjan Tor had ordered
   to kill him in case of failure), Klygon then tells him that they should
   escape together--as Gurjan Tor will also kill Klygon a "master
   assassin" even more tortuously, and as Klygon has no wish to kill his
   only remaining true friend. The two escape on their black-painted
   zaiphs tethering them a short distance outside Ardha (as night travel
   is extremely dangerous). In the morning, they see a flight of Akhmim's
   warriors pursuing the sky-sled (which Karn knows they cannot catch, due
   to its speed exceeding that of any zaiph). When the two set out for
   Phaolon at a higher altitude, a huge shadow comes over them. Klygon
   looks toward the shadow's source which turns out to be a dinosaur-sized
   hawklike bird or zawkaw. They attempt to flee from the zawkaw only to
   find that its speed exceeds that of their zaiphs; before fleeing Karn
   observes a beautiful (not in effeminate sense) bald, ebon-skinned human
   riding it. At that point, Karn finds the zoukar (an invention of the
   kaloodha, the lightning-emitting wand which Sarchimus had used to kill
   the phuol) and slays the zawkaw, panicking its rider who falls from its
   back into the abyss. However, he and Klygon are not able to regain
   control of their zaiphs till these hit the forest floor (which kills
   the zaiphs).

   In the meantime Janchan, Niamh and Zarqa (along with a captive Arjala)
   prepare to restart after a night spent parked; at this point Arjala's
   haughtiness comes to the forefront as she criticises the rude breakfast
   they have--and her feeling of humiliation is aggravated when Niamh
   reminds her that she (Niamh) too is a Goddess (as Princess/Goddess are
   integrated in Phaolon). When they restart the sky-sled at high
   altitude, they see a large floating city from which zawkaw with
   ebon-skinned riders (similar to the one that chased Karn and Klygon)
   flying around it. A flight of the zawkaw lands near the quartet, who
   are taken captive by the riders and taken into the city. There, an old
   man tells them the city is named Calidar, at which Arjala is initially
   overjoyed (she had earlier welcomed the ebon-skinned men as her
   "cousins", though they gave her no recognition)--but her joy is turned
   to horror as the old man, Nimbalim of Yoth, informs her that she is
   viewed as merely another captive. Niamh is thrilled at meeting Nimbalim
   (whom she had always been told had died a thousand years prior--even
   his city had been destroyed sometime later by the Blue Barbarians
   during one of their madness-times).

   Karn and Klygon have meantime taken shelter, but are disappointed at
   the forest floor as it provides only some tasteless (though plentiful)
   food items. They are captured by a tribe of albinos who ride on huge
   earthworms (known as sluth) and taken into caves in the trees'
   root-networks. There, they meet a blue-skinned man who identifies
   himself as "Delgan of the Isles" (the "of the Isles" particularly
   intrigues Karn who has lived entirely in the treetops), to whom Klygon
   takes an immediate dislike. Karn notices that Delgan is rather refined
   for a "Blue Barbarian" (the only race of which he knows having such
   skin colour). The troglodytes, led by Gor-ya, add Klygon and Karn to
   their herd of slave tenders of grubs known as ygnoum. Gor-ya also warns
   them that they must keep the ygnoum safe from enemies he terms kraan.
   When the kraan (hippo-sized red ants) later attack the troglodytes and
   slaughter many of the ygnoum, Gor-ya tries to punish Klygon by whipping
   him to death, but is stopped when Karn thrusts a torch in his face
   giving him serious burns--for which Karn is sentenced to be killed by
   the largest of the sluth (suggested to Gor-ya by Delgan).

   One of the younger of the black men of Calidar, Ralidux, finds Arjala
   fascinating; he discusses this with an elder, Clyon, who attempts to
   dissuade him. The travellers (including Nimbalim) plan on escaping
   Calidar but are initially stymied by the sky-sled's being too
   small--for which Niamh finds a solution, capturing (and riding) one of
   the zawkaw. Eventually, Zarqa is able to tap Ralidux' mind and use him
   to control a zawkaw--on which Niamh and Arjala ride with him. The
   travellers' escape is detected however, and a flight of the
   zawkaw-riders armed with a pain-rod (less-powerful version of the
   zoukar) knocks Zarqa (piloting the sky-sled) unconscious. Janchan then
   takes control and brings the sky-sled to a stop.

   Delgan visits the condemned Karn and gives him his weathercloak,
   witchlight, rapier and zoukar--and tells him to hurry so they can
   escape. As they do so, the troglodytes awaken the huge sluth which
   pursues the trio. Karn then pushes a button on the witchlight (warning
   Delgan and Klygon to cover their eyes), and turns away. The witchlight
   has one lightning-bright flash which kills the huge sluth--but the
   reflection on the water's surface blinds Karn. The trio escape in a
   boat made from a fallen leaf to the inland sea, and land on a small
   isle--where Delgan strikes Klygon unconscious and robs the two of
   weathercloak, rapiers and zoukar. Mockingly he states, "in my land, I
   am a king; I go to reclaim my throne". Klygon regains consciousness,
   and he and Karn hear the wings of the zawkaw (piloted by Ralidux, now
   free of Zarqa's mind-control) overhead.
