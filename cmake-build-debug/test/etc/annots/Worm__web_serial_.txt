   Taylor Hebert is a fifteen-year-old parahuman who has developed the
   power to sense and control insects following a traumatic event. She
   lives in the fictional city of Brockton Bay, a hotspot of parahuman
   activity, and seeks to become a superhero. On her first night out in
   costume, she defeats a superpowered gang leader and is subsequently
   mistaken for a villain by a team of teenage parahuman thieves known as
   the Undersiders who work jobs for a mysterious benefactor. Taylor
   infiltrates the team, hoping to learn the identity of their boss before
   turning them into the authorities. However, Taylor grows increasingly
   close to the Undersiders whilst having repeatedly poor run-ins with the
   parahuman law enforcement agency known as the Protectorate and finds
   herself unable to betray them. She commits to the Undersiders, adopting
   the moniker "Skitter" and abandoning her dream of becoming a superhero.
   After a job, Taylor learns that the Undersiders unwittingly assisted
   their boss, revealed to be a parahuman gang lord known as Coil, in the
   kidnapping of Dinah, a girl with powerful precognitive powers, and is
   wracked with guilt over her own part.

   Brockton Bay experiences a period of instability, culminating in an
   attack by Leviathan, one of three powerful monsters collectively called
   the Endbringers, devastating the city. In the aftermath and at Coil's
   direction, the Undersiders seize territory and begin to operate as
   makeshift warlords in the ruined city. Privately, Taylor and the
   Undersiders plot to depose Coil if they cannot secure Dinah's release.
   When Jack Slash, the theatrical leader of a notorious gang of parahuman
   serial killers, invades Brockton Bay, Dinah predicts he will bring
   about the end of the world in two years if not stopped. The city
   weathers the incursion, but its parahumans fail to kill either Jack or
   his prized protege Bonesaw, a young girl kidnapped and moulded by the
   gang of serial killers. In the process of escaping the city, Jack
   learns of Dinah's prophecy and decides his ultimate show will be
   fulfilling it and ending the world.

   Coil, valuing Dinah's precognitive abilities too highly to consider her
   release, attempts to assassinate Taylor when she pushes the issue. She
   survives and the Undersiders kill Coil in retaliation, positioning
   themselves to take over the remnants of Coil's criminal empire and
   fully entrenching themselves as the shadowy rulers of Brockton Bay,
   though it remains ostensibly governed by the United States of America.
   Together, Taylor and the Undersiders carefully balance staving off
   attempts by regional criminal organisations to establish footholds in
   their city with scuffles against the legal authority of the city and
   assisting the remaining civilian population. At Dinah's counsel, Taylor
   decides to surrender herself to the authorities and in the fallout is
   forcefully recruited to the Protectorate as the new probationary
   superhero "Weaver," leaving Brockton Bay for the city of Chicago.

   Over the next two years, Taylor serves out her probation as Weaver with
   the Chicago Wards, a team of teenage superheroes attached as a youth
   group to the Chicago Protectorate. When Dinah's deadline passes, Jack
   returns from hiding at the head of an army of cloned parahumans,
   forcing Weaver and her allies to go to war against Jack Slash to
   prevent the apocalypse. They manage to successfully hold off Jack and
   his army, however, at the last minute, Jack convinces Scion, the most
   powerful superhero of all to kill billions in an interdimensional
   rampage. It is revealed that Scion is the avatar of an unfathomably
   powerful alien Entity called The Warrior, responsible for seeding the
   planet with superpowers in the first place.

   Taylor, with her power surgically altered to now control people rather
   than insects, seizes complete control over the trans-dimensional array
   of parahuman defenders and ultimately defeats Scion before having her
   connection to her power removed for good by another powerful
   precognitive parahuman, Contessa. Contessa is shown to be the final
   agent and architect of the interdimensional conspiracy known as
   Cauldron, suggested to be responsible for many of the previous events
   of the story with the aim of combatting the alien Scion. In a series of
   epilogues, the short-term fate of the remaining Undersiders is
   addressed and Taylor finds herself living as an unpowered human on the
   largely untouched Earth-Aleph, the alternate universe which most
   closely mirrors the real world.
