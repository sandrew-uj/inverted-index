   In May 1137, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury Abbey is determined that the
   Abbey must have the relics of a saint. Finding no suitable local saint,
   Robert finds one in nearby Wales.

   Brother Cadfael has two novices assisting him in his herb and vegetable
   gardens: John (practical, down-to-earth, whose vocation Cadfael doubts)
   and the ambitious Columbanus (of whose illness Cadfael is sceptical,
   although he treats him with sedating poppy syrup). Columbanus and
   Brother Jerome, Robert's clerk, go to Saint Winifred's Well in North
   Wales for a cure. When they return Columbanus says Saint Winifred
   appeared to him, saying that her grave at Gwytherin was neglected; she
   wished to lie somewhere more accessible to pilgrims. Abbot Heribert
   approves the trip to Wales to retrieve Winifred's remains. Robert,
   Sub-Prior Richard, Jerome and Columbanus are joined by Cadfael (fluent
   in Welsh) and John (for menial work).

   The bishop of Bangor and Owain Gwynedd (prince of Gwynedd) consent.
   When the monks reach Gwytherin (on the Cledwen River) the local priest,
   Father Huw, objects to Winifred's remains being removed without
   approval by the free men of the parish. Rhisiart, the community's most
   influential landowner, opposes Winifred's removal. Robert tries to
   bribe him, and Rhisiart storms off. The assembly dissolves, agreeing
   with Rhisiart. Father Huw persuades Robert to ask Rhisiart for another
   meeting the next day, to which he agrees. While John helps the servants
   (and Jerome and Columbanus keep vigil at Winifred's chapel), Robert,
   Richard, Cadfael and Huw await Rhisiart; he does not appear. The
   landowner is found dead in the woods, with an arrow in his chest
   bearing the mark of Engelard (an Englishman in love with Rhisiart's
   daughter, Sioned). When Engelard appears, Robert insists he be taken
   into custody. Engelard flees, and Brother John impedes the only local
   man close enough to stop him. Robert orders John held for breaking the
   law of Gwynedd and his vow of obedience; this pleases John as he is
   held where his love, Annest, lives.

   Cadfael realises that Engelard's arrow did not kill Rhisiart: his back
   is damp, while his front is dry. Rhisiart was stabbed from behind by a
   dagger, falling face-down. After it rained, someone turned him over and
   pushed an arrow into the wound from the front. The locals see
   Rhisiart's death as an omen, and agree to Winifred's removal; Robert
   plans to exhume her remains after a three-night vigil. Cadfael hopes
   the superstition that a corpse will bleed if touched by the murderer
   will force a confession. At his suggestion Sioned asks that after each
   night's prayer, those keeping watch place their hands on Rhisiart's
   heart. Jerome does so, but Robert refuses. The third night, Cadfael and
   Columbanus keep watch. Columbanus has another seizure; he is removed
   unconscious in the morning, evading Sioned's request. He recovers after
   mass, saying that Winifred told him Rhisiart should be buried in her
   grave when she is removed.

   Winifred is exhumed, her linen-wrapped skeleton placed in the coffin
   brought from Shrewsbury and the coffin sealed with wax. As Rhisiart is
   prepared for burial, Sioned asks Peredur (another suitor) to place a
   jewelled cross on his body. Peredur refuses, confessing that he found
   Rhisiart dead and pushed Engelard's arrow into the wound so Engelard
   would disappear as rival for Sioned's hand. Cadfael finds the flask of
   poppy syrup (brought for Columbanus) nearly empty, recalling that when
   Rhisiart was murdered, only Jerome drank the wine provided for the
   vigil; if Jerome slept through the vigil, he would be ashamed to admit
   it. Before the monks depart, Columbanus offers to keep vigil and falls
   asleep; a vision of a young woman wakes him, asking why he murdered
   Rhisiart. Columbanus confesses, begging forgiveness. Touching her veil,
   Columbanus realises the saint is Sioned and slashes at her with a knife
   before fleeing. Cadfael and Engelard tackle him outside, and Engelard
   accidentally breaks Columbanus' neck. Cadfael acts quickly; he,
   Engelard and Sioned undress Columbanus, open Winifred's coffin, replace
   her above Rhisiart's body and place Columbanus's body in the coffin and
   ensure that the coffin appears undisturbed.

   Columbanus' sandals, shirt and habit are found on the chapel floor,
   with hawthorn petals around them. Robert proclaims that Columbanus's
   prayers have been answered. The villagers load the saint's coffin on a
   cart, and as they leave Cadfael sees John bidding them farewell.

   Two years later Bened calls at Shrewsbury, telling Cadfael that John
   and Annest are married and John will become smith after Bened. Sioned
   and Engelard, also married, have named their child Cadfael. Bened also
   notes that Winifred's former resting place is the scene of pilgrimages
   and cures; the Abbey reliquary is ignored by pilgrims. Cadfael muses
   that the saint will not mind sharing her grave with Rhisiart.
