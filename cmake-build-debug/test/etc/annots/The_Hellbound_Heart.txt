   Frank Cotton is a hedonist selfishly devoted to sensual experience even
   if it harms others. Believing he has indulged in every pleasure the
   world can offer, Frank pursues rumours of the Lemarchand Configuration,
   a puzzle box said to open a "schism" or portal to an extradimensional
   realm of unfathomable pleasure ruled by beings called the Cenobites. In
   Duesseldorf, Frank obtains the box and returns with it to his deceased
   grandmother's home in England. Solving the box, he is confused and
   horrified when the Cenobites arrive and are horribly scarified
   creatures whose bodies have been modified to the point that they appear
   sexless and in constant pain. The Cenobites warn he cannot renege on
   their agreement once it is made, but Frank still eagerly accepts the
   offer of experiences he has never known before. With Frank as their
   newest "experiment", the Cenobites subject him to total sensory
   overload and he realises their devotion to sadomasochism is so extreme
   and their personalities so removed from humanity that they no longer
   differentiate between pain and pleasure and have no care to ever stop
   even if their subject no longer wishes the experience. Frank is taken
   to the Cenobite realm, a hellish dimension where he will be subjected
   to an eternity of torture.

   Sometime later, Frank's brother, Rory, moves into the home in England
   with his wife Julia. Unknown to Rory, Julia had an affair with Frank a
   week before their wedding and has lusted after him since. While in the
   attic, Rory accidentally cuts his hand and bleeds on the spot where
   Frank was taken by the Cenobites. The blood, mixed with semen Frank had
   left on the floor before he was taken, opens a dimensional schism.
   Frank returns, his body now reduced to a desiccated corpse by the
   Cenobites' experiments. Julia later finds him and promises to restore
   his body so he can truly live and they can be together.

   While Rory works, Julia seduces men at bars and brings them to the
   attic where she murders them. Frank feeds on their bodies, causing his
   own to slowly regenerate. Kirsty, a friend of Rory's who has romantic
   feelings for him, suspects Julia is having an affair. Attempting to
   catch Julia in the act, she encounters Frank, who attempts to kill her.
   Kirsty grabs the puzzle box, using it as a weapon before fleeing. She
   collapses on the street from exhaustion and wakes up in a hospital
   later. While waiting, she solves the box and inadvertently summons a
   Cenobite. The Cenobite explains the box is called the Lemarchand
   Configuration and realizes Kirsty summoned it by accident, but then
   remarks this does not matter. The Cenobite intends to take Kirsty now
   that it is here, but she then reveals Frank is alive on Earth again.
   Though skeptical that one of their experiments could have escaped, the
   Cenobite is intrigued. It agrees that if Kirsty leads them to Frank and
   he confirms his identity, they will take him back and perhaps leave her
   alone.

   The Cenobite seems to vanish and Kirsty returns to the house. Rory and
   Julia claim they killed Frank but Kirsty realizes the man she is
   speaking to is Frank wearing Rory's skin. Another altercation ensues,
   during which Frank inadvertently kills Julia. Kirsty then baits Frank
   into admitting his true name out loud. The Cenobites appear, ensnare
   Frank and return him to their realm, telling Kirsty to leave.
   Downstairs, Kirsty sees Julia's disembodied head calling for help. The
   leader of the Cenobites, a being called the Engineer, then appears and
   seems to take away Julia as well before briefly bumping into Kirsty.
   After leaving the house, Kirsty realizes the Engineer gave her the
   puzzle box to watch over until another seeks it out.

   Looking at the box's surface, Kirsty imagines she sees Julia and
   Frank's faces but not Rory's. She wonders if there are other puzzles
   that may unlock doors to a paradise where Rory resides, but laments
   that she may never find one and that broken hearts might be puzzles
   that cannot be solved.
