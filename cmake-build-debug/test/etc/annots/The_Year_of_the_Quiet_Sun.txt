   During a vacation on a Florida beach in the summer of 1978, Brian
   Chaney, a demographer and biblical scholar, is approached by a woman
   named Kathryn van Hise. Initially assuming her to be a reporter
   interested in a controversial book he just published on the Dead Sea
   scrolls, she informs him that she works for the federal Bureau of
   Standards and that she is recruiting him for a physical survey of the
   future via a secretly constructed "TDV" or time displacement vehicle.
   When Chaney demurs, she informs him that his contract has been
   purchased from the think tank where he works, leaving him little
   choice.

   The reluctant Chaney travels by armored train to a military
   installation south of Joliet, Illinois. There he is teamed with two
   diversely talented military officers, United States Air Force Major
   William Moresby and United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Arthur
   Saltus. Chaney soon finds that he shares with Saltus an attraction to
   Kathryn, who is their civilian liaison, but unlike Saltus, Chaney lacks
   the assertiveness to pursue her aggressively. Instead he focuses his
   attention on the project, which is soon ordered by the President of the
   United States to embark on their first mission, a trip two years into
   the future to discover whether he wins the 1980 presidential election.

   The three travel to the Thursday after the election on individual
   trips, with first Moresby and then Saltus going first according to
   military seniority. Chaney, as a civilian, is the last to leave, but
   arrives earlier than the others due to a temporal navigation instrument
   error. They discover that the president, whom Chaney despises as a weak
   man (in fact, his name is given as "President Meeks"), wins the
   election in a landslide as a result of his successful handling of
   ongoing race riots in Chicago, and that these riots have resulted in
   the building of a wall down the middle of Cermak Road dividing the
   north of the city from the south. They also learn that the nation is
   under martial law after a failed attempt by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
   to take over the government by coup d'etat, one thwarted because of the
   advance knowledge the time travelers will bring back of it. While
   preparing for their return, Saltus informs Chaney of an additional
   discovery: a marriage license between him and Kathryn. With Saltus
   gloating in the knowledge of his inevitably successful courtship,
   Chaney concedes the pursuit to him.

   With the success of the initial mission, the three are authorized to
   travel further into the future. They plan to travel to dates of their
   own choosing within the coming two decades, with each trip to be
   separated by approximately a year in order to provide broader coverage.

   Moresby goes first and travels to July 4, 1999 ("It has significance,
   after all!" he says), only to emerge in the middle of a racial civil
   war in which Chicago had recently been attacked with a nuclear bomb
   launched from China on behalf of black guerrillas. Quickly getting
   involved in a battle between base troops and invading "ramjets", as the
   black guerrillas are called, Moresby dies in an attack on a ramjet
   mortar position.

   Saltus is the next to go, traveling to the date of his 50th birthday in
   2000. Upon his arrival he discovers remnants of the battle, and is
   nearly killed by survivors hiding out on the base. Wounded, he is
   assisted back to the displacement vehicle by an unknown figure and
   returns to the present, taking with him a tape-recorded report that
   Moresby had made upon his arrival.

   Forewarned by Saltus's experience, Chaney travels further into the
   future. Not having chosen a date, and disillusioned by his experiences
   on the 1980 trip, he arrives at an indeterminate point in "2000-plus",
   by which time the power from the base's nuclear reactor has been
   disrupted, causing the chronometers set up for the travelers to shut
   down. Venturing outside the building, he finds the base to be
   long-neglected, apart from a cistern and a grave. While further
   investigating the grave (which is that of Saltus), he is approached by
   a young man and a woman who identify themselves as Arthur and Kathryn's
   children. They take Chaney to Kathryn, now elderly, who reveals to
   Chaney that civilization collapsed as an indirect result of the time
   travel project; with the information from the future, the president
   made a series of disastrous decisions that led to war with China,
   followed by the civil war and societal destruction. When Chaney asks
   how much of this information he reports, she informs him that he
   reported none of it, that with the loss of power the time displacement
   vehicle could no longer return to the past and that Chaney was forever
   trapped in the future.

   Although it is foreshadowed earlier in the book, only at this point is
   the reader explicitly told a fact that makes Chaney's predicament all
   the more tragic. He is black, the only such member of the project.
   "Everyone fears you; no one will trust you since the rebellion,"
   Kathryn tells him. "I am the only one here who does not fear a black
   man."
