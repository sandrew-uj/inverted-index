   The novella and the film adaptation have the same alternate timeline
   setting, diverging with the failed assassination of President John F.
   Kennedy. Instead of concentrating on the Space Race, technological
   advancements in robotics, animal intelligence, and telepathy take
   place. A more heated Cold War takes place, culminating in a
   conventional World War III. A truce is signed, lasting another 25
   years, though mounting tensions lead to World War IV in 2007, this time
   involving massive nuclear warfare and only lasting five days.
   Civilization is almost entirely obliterated, leaving the surface of
   Earth reduced to a desolate, irradiated wasteland.

   Years later, in 2024, foragers who remain above ground must fight for
   the remaining resources. Most survivors in the former United States are
   male, as women were usually in the bombed cities while many men were
   out fighting in the war. In the novella, nuclear fallout had created
   horrific mutations, such as the feared burnpit screamers, known for
   their noise and deadliness (in the film, they appear in only one scene,
   though they are only heard).
