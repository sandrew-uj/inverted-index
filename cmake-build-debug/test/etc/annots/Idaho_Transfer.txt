   Teenager Karen Braden (Kelley Bohanon) is a troubled mental hospital
   outpatient who is taken by her father George and sister Isa to a
   government facility near the Craters of the Moon lava fields in Idaho.
   The project there was commissioned to develop matter transference, but
   made a different discovery: time travel. They also discovered that a
   mysterious ecological catastrophe will soon wipe out civilization.

   The time travel process has negative health effects, though. Adults
   "not much older than 20" are unable to survive for long, as their
   kidneys hemorrhage shortly after the experience. So the scientists
   decide to only send young people 56 years into the future so they can
   build a new civilization.

   After the government takes over the project, the transfer machines are
   turned off, trapping a large number of project members in the future.
   Now trapped, they begin exploring the future world. The last survivor
   from the project is picked up by a family dressed in futuristic
   clothing. She is placed alive in the trunk of their car, to be used as
   fuel. The small girl in the back seat asks what will happen when they
   run out of them (people from the past), "Will we have to use each
   other, then?"
