   King Ghidorah face-to-face with Gigan

   Unleashed takes place twenty years after Godzilla: Save the Earth,
   beginning when a meteor shower causes climate shifts and earthquakes.
   Simultaneously, monsters of Earth begin attacking cities across the
   globe as a result of crystals growing on the ground. Factions form
   among the members of Earth as well as the monsters attacking them,
   totaling four monster factions. Choices within the story affect later
   events, including the relationships between Earth factions and the
   monster ones. The Vortaak, returning from the previous games, choose to
   invade and use the crystals to seize Earth, but their mothership was
   knocked into the San Francisco Bay. It is revealed in the finale that
   the source of the crystals was SpaceGodzilla trying to escape his
   interdimensional prison that he was trapped in at the end of Save the
   Earth.

   The game has four different endings depending on what faction you are
   on. Earth Defenders and Global Defense monsters berid the crystals,
   defeat the mutants, run off the Vortaak, and are congratulated by the
   human forces. Players on the Alien Faction destroy the human forces and
   see Vorticia laugh in victory. Those on the Mutant Faction allow the
   crystals to spread rapidly, and will see SpaceGodzilla roar in victory.
   Any monster who has acquired all of the Power Surges will become
   corrupted and evil, with the reporter saying the player's monster was
   their only hope.
