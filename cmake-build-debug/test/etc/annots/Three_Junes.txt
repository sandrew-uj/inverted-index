   Three Junes follows the McLeods, a Scottish family, throughout their
   lives and relationships. Its members are Paul and Maureen, and their
   sons: Fenno, and twins David and Dennis. At the opening of the book,
   Paul is on a tour of Greece, Maureen has died from lung cancer, and
   Fenno is running a bookstore in New York City. Other important
   characters include Malachy, Fenno's friend who is a music critic and
   suffering from AIDS, and Fern, an unwed pregnant woman, whom Paul
   formerly met on his trip to Greece, trying to recover from his wife's
   death. Finally, another important character of the book is Tony, a
   photographer, who is a house-sitter, never living in the same house for
   more than a few months. He is a catalyst in the narrative development
   of Fern and Fenno. He is an old friend with Fern and he develops a
   tumultuous relationship with Fenno.

   The novel is written in three parts, using the flashback technique.
   The first takes place in 1989 and is told from Paul's perspective; the
   second, in 1995 and from Fenno's point of view; the third, in 1999 and
   from Fern's perspective. As Julia Glass has said herself, the book
   should be viewed not as a trilogy but rather a triptych - elements that
   may seem small in one section play a large role in another, like a
   triptych, rather than a consecutive series of novels in a trilogy.
