   Rudi Mackenzie and company stage a rescue of Mathilda Arminger, Odard
   Liu, and Ingolf Vogeler from High Seeker Kuttner. They manage to free
   their companions and kill Kuttner, but not before he becomes possessed
   and almost strangles Rudi. Following their victory, Frederick Thurston
   decides to travel with Rudi to Nantucket instead of staying in Boise to
   fight his brother Martin Thurston.

   Back in Twin Falls, the Prophet Sethaz orders High Seeker Twain and
   Major Graber to kill Rudi. Rudi meanwhile comes upon a group of Mormon
   rebels, including Rebecca Nystrup and her brother. They join up with
   Rudi and reach the Deseret town of Picabo, now occupied by Church
   Universal and Triumphant (CUT). Ingolf, Rudi, Edain Aylward, and Odard
   pose as slavers, with Rebecca acting as one of their slaves, in an
   effort to infiltrate the town. In order to preserve their cover,
   however, Edain is forced to attempt to shoot an apple off of Rebecca's
   head. He misses, killing her. Ingolf's plan goes off the night before
   the CUT forces leave but it is interrupted by Graber, who wounds Rudi.
   Ingolf manages to lead the party to safety while the Mormon rebels go
   into the wilds.

   Still chased by Graber, Rudi's company attempts to find a place they
   can hole up so Rudi can heal. While unconscious, Rudi has an
   out-of-body experience in which Odin tells him he will not die of his
   wounds but instead will die in an act of self sacrifice for his people.
   Ritva Havel is ambushed by a CUT scout while hunting. Ritva barely
   defeats him; in return for his life, he warns her that High Seeker
   Twain has captured her twin sister Mary. Ritva rescues Mary and kills
   Twain, but not before Mary loses an eye. The whole company is later
   discovered by a group of Buddhist monks and they winter in their
   monastery. While at the monastery, Ignatius receives a vision from Mary
   telling him to look after Mathilda.

   After leaving the monks, the company is joined by Virginia Kane. As the
   group enters Sioux territory, they are greeted by Sioux chief Red Leaf
   and his soldiers who demand that they leave. However, Virginia is the
   daughter of a prominent local rancher who was Red Leaf's blood brother.
   Her father was killed by a rival and his CUT allies. For Virginia's
   sake, Red Leaf gives the group sanctuary, but they run into the group
   of ranchers chasing her, along with Major Graber. Graber and Rudi
   fight; Rudi is victorious, but spares Graber. The ranchers and the CUT
   are driven away after the two forces accidentally upset some lions.
   Rudi and his group stay with Red Leaf's tribe, but leave just before
   Graber returns with reinforcements. With the help of Red Leaf's son,
   they manage to get on the other side of a huge stream of migrating
   buffalo, thus losing Graber.

   Rudi and company make it to Iowa and, thanks to Ingolf's connections
   with a local influential farmer, are able to make it to Des Moines,
   where they hope to finance a trip into the eastern deathlands. The
   group, however, is ambushed by the State Police. Rudi, Ingolf, Mathilda
   and Odard are captured. It appears that the Bossman of Iowa is angry
   with Ingolf for not completing a salvaging expedition he had paid for
   into the eastern Death zones. Rudi volunteers to retrieve the goods
   that were abandoned in Illinois. The Bossman agrees on the condition
   that Rudi must do it alone in one month.

   As Rudi continues his quest, events back in Oregon come to a boil. The
   leaders of the Meeting agree that the CUT threat is too great to
   ignore. They decide to attack Pendleton. An army is formed, led by
   Astrid Larsson with Lady Tiphaine as second in command. As the army
   marches toward Pendleton, Astrid leads a black op to capture the
   Bossman of Pendleton and his family. With the help of a spy in the
   service of Sandra Arminger, Astrid, Eilir Mackenzie, Alleyne Loring,
   John Hordle and other members of the Rangers, sneak into the city and
   get access to the Bossman's palace. Meanwhile, BD, a merchant in the
   service of the Meeting, gets invited to a party the Bossman is
   throwing. While there, she sees that both President Thurston and Sethaz
   are present along with soldiers from their respective nations.

   Astrid captures the Bossman and his family, but Sethaz incites the
   crowd to attack the Rangers, who are forced to flee with only the
   Bossman. Tiphaine is able to rescue them but Astrid has been injured
   and has to cede command of the army to Tiphaine. Thanks to a traitor
   from Boise, Tiphaine knows she is outnumbered by the combined forces of
   Boise, CUT, and Pendleton. She attempts a fighting retreat in an effort
   to buy time for the infantry to escape. Chuck Barstow, commander of the
   Clan Mackenzie forces, is killed during the battle. He awakens in an
   idyllic afterlife. The Bearkillers' commander Eric Larsson loses his
   hand and almost his life except for quick action by Mike Havel Jr., but
   the army succeeds in breaking contact with the enemy.

   Back home, the Mackenzies and Bearkillers mourn their dead. Oak vows in
   front of Juniper Mackenzie to not rest until the killers of his father
   are defeated. At Larssdalen, Mike Jr. is promoted to the rank of
   A-lister and is offered the position of his late father, Lord Bear. He
   respectfully declines saying he has much to learn before he can accept.
