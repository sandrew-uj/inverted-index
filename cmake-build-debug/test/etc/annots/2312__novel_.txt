   The novel is set in the year 2312, in the great city of Terminator on
   Mercury, which is built on gigantic tracks in order to constantly stay
   in the planet's habitable zone near the terminator. Swan Er Hong, an
   artist and former asteroid terrarium designer, is grieving over the
   sudden death of her step-grandmother, Alex, who was very influential
   among the inhabitants of Terminator. After the funeral procession, a
   conference is held among the family and the close friends of Alex, some
   of whom Swan has never heard of. This includes Fitz Wahram, a native of
   the moon Titan, whom Swan dislikes. Following the conference, Swan
   decides to head out to Io to visit another friend of Alex's, called
   Wang, who has designed one of the largest qubes, or quantum computers.
   While Swan is visiting Wang on Io, an apparent attack of some sort
   fails. An attack on Terminator shortly follows; a meteorite of
   artificial origin destroys the city's tracks, stopping the city and
   exposing it to sun, essentially cooking it. As Swan travels, she learns
   more of the mystery surrounding her grandmother's death and the
   destruction of her home-city of Terminator. With Wahram and Genette,
   Swan travels throughout the solar system and investigates an escalating
   series of conspiracies.

   Inspector Genette eventually discovers how the artificial meteorite
   that destroyed Terminator was created: someone launched a large number
   of smaller objects on trajectories that would eventually cause them to
   coalesce above Mercury, but low enough that the planet's defense system
   could not destroy the now large object in time. The complexity of the
   attack leads her to determine that quantum computers must have been
   used.

   Meanwhile, Swan and Wahram become involved in restoring and re-wilding
   the climate-change-ravaged Earth by returning thousands of species from
   space-based temporary environments to their home environments on the
   Earth.
