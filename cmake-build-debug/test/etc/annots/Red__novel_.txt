   In Red: The Heroic Rescue, Thomas has spent fifteen years in the "dream
   world," having been persuaded by his wife Rachelle to eat the
   "Rhambutan" fruit which will prevent him from dreaming. Only seven
   hours have passed in the world of Earth, but the plague has been
   released in several cities. Followers of Elyon live in the seven
   forests. The deserts outside of the forests are home to the Horde, with
   a much larger population than the forests. Members of the Horde
   (individually referred to as "Scabs") are subject to the degenerative
   skin disease of the fallen world and are constantly trying to conquer
   and destroy the inhabitants of the forest. They worship Teeleh,
   carrying banners with images of the Shataiki. Thomas is referred to as
   "General Thomas of Hunter" and is commander of the Forest Guard, and a
   legendary figure among the Forest Dwellers and the Horde alike.
   However, as the story unfolds, it is revealed that the Horde also have
   a legendary General emerging known as Martyn. One whose strategies are
   bolder and cleverer, and have yet to be seen by the Forest Guard.

   In the forests, the people keep Elyon's seven rules but have added to
   them, scrupulously trying to make it as difficult as possible to
   violate the actual rules. Interpretation of the rules is vested in a
   priest-like figure named Ciphus, from the Southern Forest. Members of
   the Horde are allowed to come and become part of the forest dwellers,
   but this is actively discouraged as Ciphus has determined there is not
   enough water in the lakes to support a much larger population. This is
   generally not an issue, as the skin disease of the Horde makes any
   contact with water agonizingly painful, and the Horde view themselves
   as "normal" and the forest dwellers as "defective." Occasionally,
   however, a Horde member will be washed, as is the case with a wise
   village elder named Jeremiah. Also, forest dwellers who go too long
   without bathing in Elyon's water begin to develop the skin disease,
   eventually losing the ability to think rationally and becoming members
   of the Horde. The Forest Guard has developed extensive procedures for
   carrying bathing water with them while on patrol in order to try to
   prevent this.

   Justin is a former member of the Forest Guard under Thomas. When Thomas
   offered him the rank of second in command, Justin declined and left the
   Forest Guard entirely. The young woman Mikil become Thomas' second in
   command. Justin begins to anger the leadership of the forest dwellers
   by his unorthodox ideas. It is revealed that Justin always seems to be
   clean of the disease even when he seems to have been unable to bathe.

   Justin attempts to broker a peace between the Horde and the forest
   dwellers, on one occasion speaking with Martyn in the middle of a
   battle to secure the safety of the Southern Forests Guard and their
   leader Jamous, (who is in love with Mikil) and to encourage good will
   between the two cultures. However, Justin is betrayed and sentenced to
   death by the leadership under Ciphus. Initially he is forced into a
   Gladiator-style face off against Thomas of Hunter. Justin exhibits
   equal if not superior skills in sword and hand-to-hand combat though he
   never harms Thomas. As Justin emerges the victor he leaves the arena
   and greets a waiting Martyn at the crest of the arena to a shocked
   audience. As Thomas signals his guard to move in on Justin and Martyn,
   Thomas himself confronts them face-to-face. When he draws his sword on
   Martyn he is horrified to discover Martyn to be the once innocent
   Johan, Thomas' brother-in-law. Johan had once been part of the guard
   under Thomas' command and was assumed to have been killed in battle
   when in fact he became stranded and the disease took him. Later, it is
   shown that Justin is Elyon in an adult form. Thomas doesn't makes a
   deal with Johan to pretend that Justin had betrayed both the Forest and
   the Horde, so that they can have him killed.

   A Horde Army is encroaching on the Forest, and demands the right to
   carry out the execution as they consider Justin to have betrayed them,
   too. Justin is sentenced to death with the Horde's most feared form of
   execution: drowning in water. He is first hung over the lake and beaten
   until his bones are broken and he is severely disfigured. Mysteriously,
   during his drowning, Justin's body begins to be covered with the Horde
   skin disease. Upon his death, Johan in a fit of rage attacks Justin and
   thrusts his sword into him. Justin's blood pours into the lake,
   violating Elyon's prohibition about blood entering the water.

   The next day, the water itself has turned blood red and the forest
   dwellers are all completely infected with the skin disease. Yet
   Justin's dead body cannot be found in the depths of the lake. Thomas's
   wife Rachelle remembers a command Justin had once given her to "follow
   me". First she, Thomas, Johan, and then others including both forest
   dwellers and members of the Horde, give up their lives in the red
   water, finding that they, too, are returned to life and completely
   cleansed of the skin disease. In fact, these new followers of Elyon
   through Justin discover that they need never be cleansed again: they
   are immune to the skin disease.

   Meanwhile, the leadership of the former forest dwellers have been
   corrupted by the disease and merge the religions of Elyon and Teeleh,
   inviting the Horde to come dwell in the forest. The sacrifice of
   drowning in the red water is unthinkable to those infected with the
   disease, and they view the cleansed people as defective "albinos." The
   "albinos" flee for their lives into the desert. On the way, however,
   Rachelle is shot with three arrows and dies.

   There, Justin himself meets them and excitedly proclaims his happiness
   over them. He proclaims the new group to be his "Circle" (a symbol of
   marriage dating back to the days of the colored forest) and to be his
   "bride," and ecstatically thanks his father for what he calls his
   "beautiful bride," referring to God as his "father." Justin reveals to
   the Circle that they will find more red pools hidden in the desert and
   that for the rest of their lives they will be his and will be charged
   with the mission of saving as many members of the Horde as possible by
   inviting them to drown in the pools.

   The title "Red" thus refers to the color of the blood shed by Justin to
   redeem his followers from the Fall, and to the blood-red pools in which
   his followers give up their lives in order to be reborn as Justin's
   people.
