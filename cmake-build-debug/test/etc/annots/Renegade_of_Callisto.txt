   In the final adventure set on the Jovian moon Callisto, or Thanator,
   three comrades of series hero Jandar are lost in a damaged airship.
   Jungle boy Taran, Yathoon warrior Koja and their pet othode Fido, drift
   away from the city of Shondakar into the plains ruled by the insectoid
   Yathoon hordes.

   Taken captive by one of the hordes, they meet fellow prisoner Xara,
   princess of Ganatol, waylaid on her way to Shondakar to secure an
   alliance against the mercantile Perushtar city-states.

   Koja and Borak, another Yathoon prisoner, escape and find sanctuary
   with Koja's own horde, while Taran and Xara are saved by another
   airship sent by Jandar to locate the missing protagonists. Xara falls
   in love with Vandar, the ship's captain. Unfortunately, rescued and
   rescuers are quickly retaken by the Yathoon and carried away to Sargol,
   the hidden capital of all the insectoid hordes.

   Koja, who has reassumed the leadership he once held over his own horde,
   is there as well. He challenges the Yathoon emperor to a duel for the
   right to rule the combined hordes. The contest takes the form of a game
   of Darza (Thanatorian chess), utilizing as pieces live players who must
   fight to the death. Taran, Xara and Valkar become some of Koja's
   "pieces."

   The game is interrupted by Fido and other othodes, and Koja and the
   emperor end up fighting singly. Koja is triumphant, becoming the new
   emperor of the hordes, and his human companions are saved. Jandar shows
   up in the denouement to help celebrate and take the protagonists home
   to Shondakar.
