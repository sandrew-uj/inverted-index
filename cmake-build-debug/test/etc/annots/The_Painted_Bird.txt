   The book describes the wandering boy's encounters with peasants engaged
   in all forms of sexual and social deviance such as incest, bestiality,
   and rape, and in other forms of extreme violence exciting lust. The
   book's title was drawn from an incident in the story. The boy, while in
   the company of a professional bird catcher, observes how the man took
   one of his captured birds and painted it several colors. Then he
   released the bird to fly in search of a flock of its kin, but when the
   painted bird came upon the flock, they saw it as an intruder and
   viciously attacked the bird until it fell from the sky.
