   A long-period meteor's orbit is determined to be crossing directly in
   the path of Earth's orbit. All of the world's nuclear states fire their
   missiles at the comet, but pieces of the comet continue to strike the
   Earth, contaminating the groundwater and causing millions to become
   sick.

   The story follows David Dmatti (Joe Lando) as he searches for his wife
   Kate (Claudia Christian) and sick daughter Allison (Madison
   McLaughlin). They were initially quarantined in the Las Vegas Valley.
   David finds and revives a young woman named Lynn (Cooper Harris) at a
   gas station and brings her with him to Las Vegas.

   When they arrive, they watch as most of the city is destroyed by a
   meteor shower and learn the quarantined were transferred to Los
   Angeles. David is also able to get an antidote for the mysterious
   illness. When it is discovered that the largest comet fragment will
   most likely hit Los Angeles, a panicked evacuation is begun. The
   problem is that the quarantined are left behind. While trying to rescue
   David's family, Lynn dies, leaving enough antidote for David's
   daughter. He and his family are soon reunited and watch the final
   fragment strike the city from a safe distance.
