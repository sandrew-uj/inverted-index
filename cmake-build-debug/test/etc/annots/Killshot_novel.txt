   Carmen and Wayne Colson live a quiet, suburban life. Carmen is a
   realtor while Wayne is an ironworker. Suddenly everything is violently
   changed when they stumble upon an extortion plot hatched by two crooks,
   Armand "Blackbird" Degas and his partner Richie Nix. While Richie is
   unstable and impatient, the Blackbird is calm and collected. After
   Wayne forces the two away with a Sleever Bar, the criminals decide to
   exact vengeance on the Colsons, leading to a tense climax.
