   Each volume of the Chronicles of Kylix is set on a different world in
   the magical solar system of the fictional star Kylix in the
   constellation of the Unicorn. The system consists of the five planets
   Zao, Olymbris, Thoorana, Zephrondus and Gulzund. Kellory the Warlock
   takes place on Zephrondus.

   Kellory is the last survivor of the Black Wolves tribe, descended from
   the Lost Kings of Illyriod. His people were massacred by the Thugoda
   Horde, who burned his father alive and held his own sword hand in the
   same fire so he could live to tell the tale but never raise a sword
   against his tormentors. He dedicates his life to revenge against the
   horde, becoming a warlock since he is no longer able to be a warrior.
   In time, he achieves his dark goal.
