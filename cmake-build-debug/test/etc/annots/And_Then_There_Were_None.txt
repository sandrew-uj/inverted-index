   Eight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast,
   each having received an unexpected personal invitation. They are met by
   the butler and cook-housekeeper, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, who explain
   that their hosts, Ulick Norman Owen and Una Nancy Owen, have not yet
   arrived, though they have left instructions.

   A framed copy of the old rhyme "Ten Little Niggers" hangs in every
   guest's room, and on the dining room table sit ten figurines. After
   supper, a phonograph record is played; the recording accuses each
   visitor as well as the Rogers of having committed murder, then asks if
   any of the "prisoners at the bar" wishes to offer a defence.

   The guests discover that none of them knows the Owens, and Mr Justice
   Wargrave suggests that the name "U N Owen" is a play on "Unknown."
   Marston finishes his drink and promptly dies of cyanide poisoning. Dr.
   Armstrong confirms that there was no cyanide in the other drinks and
   suggests that Marston must have dosed himself.

   The next morning, Mrs Rogers is found dead in her bed, and by
   lunchtime, General MacArthur has also died from a heavy blow to the
   head. The guests realise that the nature of the deaths corresponds with
   the respective lines of the rhyme, and three of the figurines are found
   to be missing.

   The guests suspect that U N Owen may be systematically murdering them
   and fruitlessly search the island. But as the island has no hiding
   places, and no one could have arrived or left, they are forced to
   conclude that one of the seven remaining persons must be the killer.
   The next morning, Rogers is found dead while chopping wood, and Emily
   Brent is found dead in the drawing room, having been injected with
   potassium cyanide.

   After Wargrave suggests searching all the rooms, Lombard's gun is found
   to be missing. Vera Claythorne goes up to her room and screams when she
   finds seaweed hanging from the ceiling. Most of the remaining guests
   rush upstairs, and when they return, they find Wargrave still
   downstairs, crudely dressed in the attire of a judge with a gunshot
   wound to the forehead. Dr. Armstrong pronounces him dead.

   That night, Lombard's gun is returned, and Blore sees someone leaving
   the house. Armstrong is absent from his room. Vera, Blore, and Lombard
   decide to stick together and leave the house. When Blore returns for
   food, he is killed by a marble clock shaped like a bear that was pushed
   from Vera's window sill. Vera and Lombard find Armstrong's body washed
   up on the beach, and each concludes the other must be responsible. Vera
   suggests moving the body from the shore as a mark of respect, but this
   is a pretext to acquire Lombard's gun. When Lombard lunges at her to
   get it back, she shoots him dead.

   Vera returns to the house in a shaken, post-traumatic state. She finds
   a noose and chair arranged in her room and a powerful smell of the sea.
   Overcome by guilt, she hangs herself in accordance with the last line
   of the rhyme.

   Scotland Yard officials arrive on the island to find nobody alive. They
   discover that the island's owner, a sleazy lawyer and drug trafficker
   called Isaac Morris, had arranged the invitations and ordered the
   recording. But he cannot be the killer, as he had died of a barbiturate
   overdose on the night the guests arrived. The police reconstruct the
   deaths with the help of the victims' diaries and a coroner's report and
   eliminate several suspects since, after each of their deaths, items had
   inexplicably been moved (for example, the chair on which Vera stood to
   hang herself had been set back upright). They also exclude Blore since
   suicide by falling clock seems highly unlikely. Ultimately, however,
   they are unable to identify the killer.

   Much later, a trawler pulls up in its nets a bottle containing a
   written confession. In it, Mr Justice Wargrave recounts that all his
   life, he had had two contradictory impulses: a strong sense of justice
   and a savage bloodlust. He had satisfied both through his profession as
   a criminal judge, sentencing murderers to death following their trial.
   But after receiving a diagnosis of a terminal illness, he decided to
   put into effect a private scheme to deal with a group of people he
   considered to have escaped justice.

   Before departing for the island, he had given Morris a lethal dose of
   barbiturates for his indigestion. His own 'death' on the island had
   initially been faked with the assistance of Dr. Armstrong under the
   pretext that it would help the group identify the killer. After
   eliminating the remaining guests, including Armstrong, he finally
   committed suicide in the same way, using the gun and some elastic to
   ensure that his true death matched the account of his faked death in
   the guests' diaries. Wargrave had written his confession and thrown it
   into the sea in a bottle in response to what he acknowledged to be his
   "pitiful human need" for recognition.
