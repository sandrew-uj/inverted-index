   Katie Mitchell is a quirky aspiring filmmaker in Kentwood, Michigan who
   often clashes with her nature-obsessed and technophobic father Rick,
   and has recently been accepted into film school in California. The
   evening before Katie leaves, Rick accidentally breaks her laptop after
   a fight between them over one of Katie's previous short films, leading
   the family to fear their relationship will forever be strained. To try
   to prevent this, Rick decides to cancel Katie's flight and instead take
   her, her mother Linda, younger brother Aaron, and family dog Monchi on
   a cross-country road trip to her college as one last bonding
   experience.

   Meanwhile, technology entrepreneur Mark Bowman declares his highly
   intelligent AI PAL obsolete as he unveils a new line of home robots in
   her place. In revenge, PAL takes over Mark's company and orders all the
   robots to capture humans worldwide and launch them into space. The
   Mitchells manage to avoid capture at a roadstop cafe in Kansas. Rick
   decides that his family should stay put in the cafe for their own
   safety, but Katie coerces him to help save the world instead. They bond
   with two defective robots that tried to capture them, Eric and
   Deborahbot 5000, who tell the family they can use a kill code to shut
   down PAL and all the robots.

   The Mitchells make it to a mall in Colorado to upload the kill code,
   but PAL orders all the PAL chip-enabled appliances to stop them. Katie
   tries to upload the kill code, but is stopped when a giant Furby
   pursues the family. They ultimately trap and defeat the Furby,
   destroying a PAL router in the process, which disables the hostile
   horde of devices. However, this also stops the kill code from
   uploading. On the way to Silicon Valley to upload the kill code
   directly to PAL, Linda reveals to Katie that she and Rick had
   originally lived in a cabin in the mountains years ago as it was his
   lifelong dream before he gave up on it.

   Upon arriving in Silicon Valley, the Mitchells disguise themselves as
   robots and head to PAL Labs HQ to shut it down, but PAL manipulates
   them by revealing surveillance footage from the cafe of Katie telling
   Aaron in secret that she was pretending to have faith in Rick so that
   he would take them to upload the kill code. As Rick becomes heartbroken
   by this, the Mitchells fail to reach PAL's lair and Rick and Linda are
   captured by PAL's stronger and smarter robots, dubbed PAL MAX Prime.
   PAL then reprograms Eric and Deborahbot into obeying her, while Katie,
   Aaron and Monchi escape the headquarters and hide from the robots.

   Katie discovers Rick's recordings of her childhood on her camera,
   realizing that Rick gave up on his lifelong dream to care for his
   daughter. In the meantime, Rick realizes the error of his ways after
   seeing one of Katie's videos that mirrors his relationship with Katie.
   Reinvigorated, Katie and Aaron infiltrate PAL Labs HQ again, this time
   using Monchi to malfunction the robots, as his appearance causes an
   error in their programming. With help from Mark, Rick and Linda free
   themselves and plan to upload a home movie of Katie's with Monchi in it
   to short-circuit the robots. However, Rick is outnumbered by the robots
   when he is about to upload the video, and Katie and Aaron are
   eventually captured.

   Facing PAL to justify saving humanity, Katie explains that no matter
   how hard her family struggles, they will always stay connected despite
   how different they are. PAL rejects this reasoning and callously drops
   Katie from her lair. Eric and Deborahbot, having been inspired by
   Rick's "reprogramming" himself that allowed him to use a computer,
   revert to their malfunctioning states and upload Katie's home movie,
   saving her and helping the rest of the Mitchells. The family bands
   together to fight the rest of the improved robots, with Linda leading
   the charge and destroying dozens. Katie eventually finds and destroys
   PAL by dropping her into a glass of water, freeing all the humans and
   disabling all the robots except for Eric and Deborahbot.

   A few months after the uprising, Katie and her family arrive at her
   college as she shares one last heartfelt goodbye with them before
   beginning her school life. She later joins them on another road trip
   with Eric and Deborahbot to Washington, D.C. to accept the
   Congressional Gold Medal.
