   The series is set many years into the future, where the world has been
   ravaged by a great nuclear holocaust known as the Great White. The few
   people left have formed a new way of living, led by a body called the
   Council.

   The Council realized that they had not escaped the effects of the Great
   White completely unscathed, and began burning any humans or animals
   born with deformities. The Council appointed a fledgling religious
   order called the Herder Faction to oversee these rituals. The Herders
   believed that Lud, their name for God, sent the Great White as
   punishment for a materialistic society. As a result, they destroyed all
   artifacts of the old world known as the Beforetime.

   Those who spoke out against the Herders, or researched the period
   before the nuclear holocaust or its technology, were declared
   Seditioners (from the word sedition) and were burnt alive. Council law
   and the Herder Faction gradually fused, and came to depend on each
   other. If the two governing bodies did not burn the dissidents, they
   sent them to work on Councilfarms. Orphan homes were set up to house
   those children of Seditioners not claimed by relatives.

   It later became clear that mutations of the mind could develop which
   were not visible at birth. The Council and Herder Faction decided that
   those few people affected by mental mutations, called Misfits, would be
   sent to the Councilfarms. They sent the more afflicted Misfits to the
   remote mountain estate of Obernewtyn to be treated, and to be isolated
   from normal people.
