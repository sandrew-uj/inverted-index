   Detective Chief Inspector E. Morse of the Thames Valley Police meets
   Anne Scott at a party hosted by Mrs Murdoch in North Oxford. Six months
   later Anne Scott is found hanging in her kitchen at 9 Canal Reach,
   Jericho, Oxford. Initially Chief Inspector Bell, from the closer Oxford
   Central station on St. Aldate's Street, is assigned to the case; but a
   fortnight later Morse takes over the investigation and subsequently
   both of Mrs Murdoch's sons, Edward "Ted" Murdoch and Michael Murdoch,
   as well as Anne Scott's former employers, brothers Charles Richards and
   Conrad Richards, and Charles's wife, Celia, come to the attention of
   Morse, as do Ms Scott's neighbours, including the nosy handyman George
   Jackson, and Sophocles's Oedipus Rex.
