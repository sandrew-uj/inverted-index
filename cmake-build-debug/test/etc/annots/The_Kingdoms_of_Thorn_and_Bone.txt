   The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone is the name of a fantasy novel series by
   Gregory Keyes, written between 2003 and 2008.^[1] They follow the story
   of Anne Dare, descendant of Virginia Dare, a famed ruler who used her
   magic to aid the kingdom of Crotheny.^[2] Her descendants rule the
   kingdom until a traitorous plot to overthrow them leads to tragedy.

   The books generally follow the overall fate of its several protagonists
   and the lands from which they hail. The events recounted deal mainly
   with the destiny of the kingdom of Crotheny. However, several strands
   of plotlines sometimes lead to one another while also expanding the
   history, characters and events of the series. The series leans more on
   its character development to develop the plot from several different
   perspectives, but is also peppered with legends, myths, detailed world
   backstory, kingdoms, wars and monsters that characterize the genre.
