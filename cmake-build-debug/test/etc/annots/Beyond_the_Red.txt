   On the fictional exoplanet of Safara, humans are second-class citizens,
   ruled over by a humanoid native species: the tall, tattooed Sepharon.
   The novels are written in first person, and switch back and forth
   between the perspectives of Kora and Eros. Kora is a young Sepharon,
   and the first female ruler of her province of Elja. Eros is a young
   half-human, half-Sepharon soldier who has grown up with nomadic
   "redblood" humans in a world where "half-breeds" like him are generally
   killed at birth.
