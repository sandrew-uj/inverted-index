   The novel takes the form of the unnamed protagonist's personal report
   to the Minister of Defence, thus becoming the 'IPCRESS File' of the
   title. Events begin soon after the protagonist's transfer from military
   intelligence to WOOC(P), a small civilian intelligence agency reporting
   directly to the British Cabinet, where he works under the command of a
   man named Dalby. An intelligence broker code-named "Jay" is suspected
   to be behind a series of kidnappings of British VIPs with the intention
   of selling them to the Soviets, and the protagonist is assigned to meet
   with Jay to secure the release of "Raven", a high-ranking scientist.
   After meeting Jay at a Soho strip club to negotiate Raven's release,
   the protagonist discovers Raven's unconscious body in a back room but
   is unsuccessful in trying to rescue him.

   WOOC(P) learns that Raven is to be transferred to the Soviets in
   Beirut, and a rescue mission is organised. The protagonist is assigned
   as a lookout and kills the occupants of a car which suddenly arrives on
   the scene, believing them to be operatives working for Jay; they
   instead turn out to be members of the US ONI. The operation is
   otherwise a success but investigation into Jay continues. A break
   appears when Housemartin, one of Jay's high-ranking operatives, is
   arrested in Shoreditch, but the protagonist and another operative
   arrive at the police station only to discover that Housemartin has been
   murdered in his cell. Information from the arrest enables WOOC(P) and
   the police to storm one of Jay's safe-houses, but it has been
   abandoned. To help with the administration of the department, the
   protagonist is assigned an assistant, Jean, a beautiful young woman
   towards whom he begins to develop romantic feelings.

   Dalby now reveals intelligence suggesting that Jay's operations will
   interfere with an American neutron bomb test in the Pacific. He, Jean
   and the protagonist are sent to the test site as British observers and
   while there the protagonist learns from an old friend that the
   Americans suspect him of being a double-agent due to the deaths of the
   US operatives. Jean reveals that Dalby has been visiting an abandoned
   Japanese bunker on the island and while following Dalby to the scene
   the protagonist is present when the site is sabotaged, setting back the
   bomb test and killing a military police officer. The protagonist is
   arrested by the Americans and interrogated, before apparently being
   transferred to Hungary on suspicion of being a Soviet agent. There he
   is drugged and subjected to psychological and physical torture, and
   nearly cracks before eventually managing to escape--only to discover
   that he is in fact in London. The protagonist takes refuge with Charlie
   Cavendish, the father of a friend killed during the Second World War,
   and attempts to reestablish contact with WOOC(P) without being
   arrested. Charlie is killed by Jay's operatives, forcing the
   protagonist on the run; he approaches Dalby at his home, but discovers
   Dalby meeting with Murray, Jay and another of Jay's
   operatives--confirming the protagonist's suspicions that Dalby is in
   fact the traitor.

   The protagonist is discovered by Murray, an undercover operative from
   military intelligence also investigating Dalby. The protagonist
   escapes, but is captured and taken to meet Jay--he has, however,
   allowed military intelligence to follow them, and Jay and Dalby are
   arrested by Colonel Ross. The protagonist reveals to Jean that Jay and
   Dalby were using a process called "Induction of Psycho-neuroses by
   Conditioned REflex with Stress" (IPCRESS) to brainwash the VIPs into
   loyalty to the Soviet Union. The links that Carswell had discovered
   were in fact indicators of the personality traits that Jay had used to
   determine which VIPs would easily succumb to the process. Colonel Ross'
   attempt to sell information to the protagonist had been a test of his
   loyalty. The novel ends with the protagonist concluding his report to
   the Minister, revealing that Jay has turned and began working for the
   British, while Dalby has ostensibly died in a car accident.
