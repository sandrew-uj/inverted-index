   In 1930s Edinburgh, six ten-year-old girls, Sandy, Rose, Mary, Jenny,
   Monica, and Eunice are assigned Miss Jean Brodie, who describes herself
   as being "in my prime," as their teacher. Miss Brodie, determined that
   they shall receive an education in the original sense of the Latin verb
   educere, "to lead out," gives her students lessons about her personal
   love life and travels, promoting art history, classical studies, and
   fascism. Under her mentorship, these six girls whom Brodie singles out
   as the elite group among her students--known as the "Brodie set"--begin
   to stand out from the rest of the school. However, in one of the
   novel's typical flash-forwards we learn that one of them will later
   betray Brodie, ruining her teaching career, but that she will never
   learn which one.

   In the Junior School, they meet the singing teacher, the short Mr
   Gordon Lowther, and the art master, the handsome, one-armed war veteran
   Mr Teddy Lloyd, a married Roman Catholic with six children. These two
   teachers form a love triangle with Miss Brodie, each loving her, while
   she loves only Mr Lloyd. However, Miss Brodie never overtly acts on her
   love for Mr Lloyd, except once to exchange a kiss with him, witnessed
   by Monica. During a two-week absence from school, Miss Brodie embarks
   on an affair with Mr Lowther on the grounds that a bachelor makes a
   more respectable paramour: she has renounced Mr Lloyd as he is married.
   At one point during these two years in the Junior School, Jenny is
   "accosted by a man joyfully exposing himself beside the Water of
   Leith." The police investigation of the exposure leads Sandy to
   imagine herself as part of a fictional police force seeking
   incriminating evidence in respect of Brodie and Mr Lowther.

   Once the girls are promoted to the Senior School (around age twelve)
   though now dispersed, they hold on to their identity as the Brodie set.
   Miss Brodie keeps in touch with them after school hours by inviting
   them to her home as she did when they were her pupils. All the while,
   the headmistress Miss Mackay tries to break them up and compile
   information gleaned from them into sufficient cause for Brodie's
   dismissal. Miss Mackay has more than once suggested to Miss Brodie that
   she should seek employment at a 'progressive' school; Miss Brodie
   declines to move to what she describes as a 'crank' school. When two
   other teachers at the school, the Kerr sisters, take part-time
   employment as Mr Lowther's housekeepers, Miss Brodie tries to take over
   their duties. She sets about fattening him up with extravagant cooking.
   The girls, now thirteen, visit Miss Brodie in pairs at Mr Lowther's
   house, where Miss Brodie frequently asks about Mr Lloyd in Mr Lowther's
   presence. At this point Mr Lloyd asks Rose and occasionally the other
   girls to pose for him as portrait subjects. Each face he paints
   ultimately resembles Miss Brodie, as her girls report to her in detail,
   and she thrills at the telling. One day when Sandy is visiting Mr
   Lloyd, he kisses her.

   Before the Brodie set turns sixteen, Miss Brodie tests her girls to
   discover which of them she can really trust, ultimately settling on
   Sandy as her confidante. Miss Brodie is obsessed with the notion that
   Rose, as the most beautiful of the Brodie set, should have an affair
   with Mr Lloyd in her place. She begins to neglect Mr Lowther, who ends
   up marrying Miss Lockhart, the science teacher. Another student, Joyce
   Emily, steps briefly into the picture, trying unsuccessfully to join
   the Brodie set. Miss Brodie takes her under her wing separately,
   encouraging her to run away to fight in the Spanish Civil War on the
   Nationalist side, which she does, only to be killed in an accident when
   the train she is travelling in is attacked.

   The original Brodie set, now seventeen and in their final year of
   school, begin to go their separate ways. Mary and Jenny leave before
   taking their exams, Mary to become a typist and Jenny to pursue a
   career in acting. Eunice becomes a nurse and Monica a scientist. Rose
   lands a handsome husband. Sandy, with a keen interest in psychology, is
   fascinated by Mr Lloyd's stubborn love, his painter's mind, and his
   religion. Sandy and Rose model for Mr Lloyd's paintings, Sandy knowing
   that Miss Brodie expects Rose to become sexually involved with Lloyd.
   Rose, however, is oblivious to the plan crafted for her and so it is
   Sandy, now eighteen and alone with Mr Lloyd in his house while his wife
   and children are on holiday, who has exactly such an affair with him
   for five weeks during the summer. Over time, Sandy's interest in the
   man wanes while her interest in the mind that still loves Jean Brodie
   grows. In the end, Sandy leaves him, adopts his Roman Catholic
   religion, and becomes a nun. Beforehand, however, she meets with Miss
   Mackay and blatantly confesses to wanting to bring a stop to Miss
   Brodie. She suggests that the headmistress could accuse Brodie of
   encouraging fascism, and this tactic succeeds. Not until her dying
   moment a year after the end of World War II is Miss Brodie able to
   imagine that it was her confidante, Sandy, who betrayed her. After her
   death however, Sandy, now called Sister Helena of the Transfiguration
   and author of The Transfiguration of the Commonplace, maintains that
   "it's only possible to betray where loyalty is due." One day, an
   enquiring young man visits Sandy at the convent, because of her strange
   book on psychology. He enquires about the main influences of her school
   years, asking her: "Were they literary or political or personal? Was it
   Calvinism?" Sandy answers him, instead, by saying: "There was a Miss
   Jean Brodie in her prime."
