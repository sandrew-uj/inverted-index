   Dragonriders of Pern is a science fantasy series written primarily by
   American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey,^[a] who initiated it in 1967.
   Beginning in 2003, her middle child Todd McCaffrey has written Pern
   novels, both solo and jointly with Anne. The series (as of July 2012)
   comprises 23 novels and several short stories. Most of the short
   fiction has been collected in two volumes or incorporated in one of the
   novels, so Dragonriders of Pern is sometimes identified with the 24
   books.^[b]^[1] Two of the novellas included in the first novel,
   Dragonflight, made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo or Nebula
   Award.^[2]
