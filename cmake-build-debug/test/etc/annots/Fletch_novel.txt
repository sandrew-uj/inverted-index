   The novel introduces I. M. Fletcher, a journalist and ex-Marine camping
   on a beach watching the drug culture for a story, waiting to find the
   dealer's source before publishing an expose.

   A millionaire businessman named Alan Stanwyk approaches Fletch to hire
   Fletch to murder him; the man tells Fletch that he is dying of bone
   cancer and wants to avoid a slow, painful death. Fletch accepts $1000
   in cash to listen to the man's proposition; the man offers him $20,000
   for the murder, and Fletch talks him up to $50,000 in an effort to see
   if the man is serious. He appears to be sincere, and Fletch begins
   investigating the man's story in between investigating the drug story
   on the beach and hiding from the two attorneys after him for alimony
   for each of his ex-wives.
