   The prequel novel New Spring takes place during the Aiel War and
   depicts the discovery by certain Aes Sedai that the Dragon has been
   Reborn. The series proper commences almost twenty years later in the
   Two Rivers, a near-forgotten district of the country of Andor. An Aes
   Sedai, Moiraine, and her Warder Lan, arrive in the village of Emond's
   Field, secretly aware that servants of the Dark One are searching for a
   young man living in the area. Moiraine is unable to determine which of
   three youths (Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, or Perrin Aybara) is the
   Dragon Reborn, and leads all three of them from the Two Rivers, along
   with their friend Egwene al'Vere. Nynaeve al'Meara, the village
   wise-woman, later joins them. Gleeman Thom Merrilin also travels with
   the group. The first novel depicts their flight from various agents of
   the Shadow and their attempts to reach the Aes Sedai city of Tar Valon.
   Thereafter the protagonists are frequently split into different groups
   and pursue different missions toward the cause of the Dragon Reborn,
   sometimes thousands of miles apart. As they struggle to unite the
   various kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is
   complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to lose their autonomy;
   by the zealots styling themselves 'the Children of the Light', who do
   not believe in the prophecies; and by the Seanchan, the descendants of
   a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire. The Aes Sedai also
   become divided on how to deal with the Dragon Reborn. As the story
   expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced.
   Deriving its name from that of Armageddon in Christian eschatology,
   Tarmon Gai'don is the apocalyptic battle wherein the Dragon Reborn
   opposes Shai'tan, while their followers fight elsewhere. Events and
   portents that foreshadow the Last Battle take place in Knife of Dreams
   and The Gathering Storm. The Last Battle itself takes place in A Memory
   of Light, in the form of a single 202-page chapter with the same title
   as the novel.^[8]
