   Colin "CD" Dobson lives a humdrum life at a critical point in history.
   The environment is being destroyed by a series of 'avalanches' - sudden
   upsets in the Earth's ecosystem, causing widespread destruction. The
   Stark conspiracy is a cabal of the world's richest and most influential
   men, who have long been aware that the planet's ecosystem is
   approaching total collapse. For decades, they have been launching
   unmanned spacecraft loaded with supplies into orbit around the Earth
   and the Moon. Seeking to save their own lives and leave everyone else
   to suffer from 'total toxic overload', they secretly build a fleet of
   spacecraft with the intention of colonising the Moon.

   Using crude intimidation, they purchase land from aborigines in Western
   Australia to use as a launch site. They sell their stocks and
   commodities to raise cash, dumping the assets at the same time and in
   high volumes to engineer a worldwide stock market crash and lower the
   price of the resources they need. They buy the Moon from the United
   States government, along with the hardware to reach it.

   Six vessels are designed to travel to the Moon, three of which will
   carry humans, with room for 250 humans in total. The vessels are named
   'Star Arks', referencing the Biblical story of Noah's Ark. The Star
   Arks contain human and animal embryos in suspended animation, as well
   as resources needed for life support. The Star Arks are prepared under
   the cover story that the consortium is building a desert resort.

   CD and his friends form a group called 'EcoAction'. Each of them has
   their own reason for fighting the consortium, with the collective goal
   of trying to protect the environment. They take action against the
   consortium's activities, and in the process uncover the conspiracy.
   They infiltrate the launch site and wreak havoc. CD and one of the
   conspirators, Sly Moorcock, compete for the affections of Rachel, who
   eventually joins the conspiracy as Sly's intended partner.

   EcoAction try to warn the rest of the world about the plan, but they
   are not taken seriously. The cabal kill many of those who have
   investigated or uncovered the conspiracy. Rachel turns on Sly at the
   last minute so she can sabotage the launch, but he overpowers and tries
   to abduct her. She escapes and rejoins the surviving members of
   EcoAction. The Stark Conspiracy blast off, but find that their
   existence is frustrating and lonely. Sly Moorcock eventually commits
   suicide. The narrative ends with an admonishment for the world's
   consumers over their inaction on environmental issues in the late 1980s
   and early 1990s.
