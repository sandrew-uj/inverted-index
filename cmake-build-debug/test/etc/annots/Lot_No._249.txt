   An illustration of the mummy from "Lot No. 249" by Martin van Maele.

   In 1884, Abercrombie Smith, an athlete and medical student at the
   University of Oxford, is called to the rooms of his neighbour and
   fellow student Edward Bellingham. Bellingham, a fanatical Egyptology
   student who owns many ancient Egyptian artefacts, has fainted from a
   severe shock. As Smith uses his medical skills to revive Bellingham,
   Bellingham's friend William Monkhouse Lee (to whose sister Bellingham
   is engaged) explains that Bellingham has a curious obsession with an
   Egyptian mummy that he purchased from an auction sale. Bellingham keeps
   the mummy in his room, and has named it "Lot 249," as those were the
   words the auctioneers put on its case.

   Over the next few weeks, Smith is frequently disturbed by the sound of
   mumbling and muttering from Bellingham's room. The building's
   caretaker, Thomas Styles, confides in Smith that he has heard something
   walking around Bellingham's room while Bellingham is out. Shortly
   afterwards, a student called Long Norton, against whom Bellingham bears
   a long-standing grudge, is violently attacked by a mysterious and
   seemingly inhuman figure. Suspecting Bellingham is connected with the
   assault, Smith vows to avoid his neighbour entirely.

   Not long afterwards, Monkhouse Lee issues a warning to Smith against
   Bellingham. He explains that he has called off his sister's engagement
   to Bellingham, after Bellingham confided in him a terrible secret about
   which he has sworn to keep silent. Later, when passing Bellingham's
   room, Smith witnesses the mummy seemingly vanish and inexplicably
   reappear in its sarcophagus.

   After discovering that Lee has been attacked in a similar manner to
   Norton, Smith concludes that Bellingham has brought the mummy to life
   and is sending it to attack people whom he dislikes. Smith confronts
   Bellingham angrily about the attack on Lee, but Bellingham denies any
   involvement. The following evening, Smith is pursued by the mummy while
   strolling along a dark country path. Fleeing in terror, he narrowly
   escapes the creature. He realises that his own life is now in danger
   and he must take action to stop Bellingham's evil. The next day Smith
   enters Bellingham's room and forces him at gunpoint to burn the mummy
   and all items associated with its animation. Once everything has been
   destroyed, Smith vows to return if Bellingham attempts any such
   activity again. Bellingham quits the university immediately and flees
   to Sudan.
