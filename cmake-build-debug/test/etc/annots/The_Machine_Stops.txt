   The story describes a world in which most of the human population has
   lost the ability to live on the surface of the Earth. Each individual
   now lives in isolation below ground in a standard room, with all bodily
   and spiritual needs met by the omnipotent, global Machine. Travel is
   permitted, but is unpopular and rarely necessary. Communication is made
   via a kind of instant messaging/video conferencing machine with which
   people conduct their only activity: the sharing of ideas and what
   passes for knowledge.

   The two main characters, Vashti and her son Kuno, live on opposite
   sides of the world. Vashti is content with her life, which, like most
   inhabitants of the world, she spends producing and endlessly discussing
   secondhand 'ideas'. Her son Kuno, however, is a sensualist and a rebel.
   He persuades a reluctant Vashti to endure the journey (and the
   resultant unwelcome personal interaction) to his room. There, he tells
   her of his disenchantment with the sanitised, mechanical world.

   He confides to her that he has visited the surface of the Earth without
   permission and that he saw other humans living outside the world of the
   Machine. However, the Machine recaptures him, and he is threatened with
   'Homelessness': expulsion from the underground environment and presumed
   death. Vashti, however, dismisses her son's concerns as dangerous
   madness and returns to her part of the world.

   As time passes, and Vashti continues the routine of her daily life,
   there are two important developments. First, the life-support apparatus
   required to visit the outer world is abolished. Most welcome this
   development, as they are sceptical and fearful of first-hand experience
   and of those who desire it. Secondly, "Technopoly", a kind of religion,
   is re-established, in which the Machine is the object of worship.
   People forget that humans created the Machine, and treat it as a
   mystical entity whose needs supersede their own.

   Those who do not accept the deity of the Machine are viewed as
   'unmechanical' and threatened with Homelessness. The Mending Apparatus
   - the system charged with repairing defects that appear in the Machine
   proper - has also failed by this time, but concerns about this are
   dismissed in the context of the supposed omnipotence of the Machine
   itself.

   During this time, Kuno is transferred to a room near Vashti's. He comes
   to believe that the Machine is breaking down, and tells her cryptically
   "The Machine stops." Vashti continues with her life, but eventually
   defects begin to appear in the Machine. At first, humans accept the
   deteriorations as the whim of the Machine, to which they are now wholly
   subservient, but the situation continues to deteriorate, as the
   knowledge of how to repair the Machine has been lost.

   Finally, the Machine collapses, bringing 'civilization' down with it.
   Kuno comes to Vashti's ruined room. Before they perish, they realise
   that humanity and its connection to the natural world are what truly
   matter, and that it will fall to the surface-dwellers who still exist
   to rebuild the human race and to prevent the mistake of the Machine
   from being repeated.
