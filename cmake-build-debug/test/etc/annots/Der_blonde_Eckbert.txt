   Eckbert lives an idyllic life, secluded in a castle deep within a
   forest in the Harz Mountains, with his wife Bertha. The two find
   happiness in their refuge away from the corrupting influences of
   society. They have no children but enjoy life together. Phillip
   Walther, Eckbert's one contact with society, shatters this harmony
   during a visit at the outset of the story. Walther had become a close
   friend of Eckbert over the years as the two frequently rode about
   Eckbert's demesne. Eckbert feels compelled to share his secret with
   Walther as his only confidant. He invites Walther to stay the night and
   enjoy familiarities and dine with Bertha. She reveals the secret of her
   childhood and begins the frame story.

   Bertha escaped from a life of hunger, poverty and abuse at a young age.
   She found herself at the center of fights between her mother and
   father. She ran away from their pastoral home, begged on the streets,
   and made her way into the woods. An old woman took Bertha to a cabin
   and taught her to weave, spin, and read as they live together with the
   old woman's animals--a dog and a magical bird. The anthropomorphic bird
   sings a variety of songs encased by the concept of Waldeinsamkeit,
   or the feeling of being alone in the forest, and the bird lays a
   precious stone each day. The birds songs always begin and end with
   Waldeinsamkeit. For instance:

   "Waldeinsamkeit,

   Mich wieder freut,

   Mir geschieht kein Leid,

   Hier wohnt kein Neid,

   Von neuem mich freut,

   Waldeinsamkeit "

   Bertha and the old woman find this arrangement pleasing, but Bertha
   yearns to meet a knight from the stories she has read. After six years
   of living with the old woman, Bertha steals a bag of precious stones
   and departs the home, taking the bird with her. As she runs away, she
   realises that the old woman and the dog won't be able to survive
   without her. She regrets her decision and wants to head back, but then
   she comes across her childhood village. She finds out about her parents
   deaths, and decides to head to the city instead of back to the old
   woman. She rents a house and gets a housekeeper, but she feels
   threatened by the fact that the bird keeps singing louder, about how he
   misses the forest. The bird terrifies her and she strangles it as she
   leaves and marries Eckbert. Walther listens to this story, reassures
   her that he can imagine the bird, and the dog "Strohmian". Walther and
   Bertha retire to bed while Eckbert worries whether his familiarity with
   Walther and the story will compromise him.

   Bertha becomes ill and lies dying a short time after confessing her
   sins to Walther. Eckbert suspects Walther may be to blame For Bertha's
   condition. He believes Walther may have been secretly planning for the
   death of Bertha. His paranoia and suspicions grow more intense after he
   realized that Walther revealed the name of Bertha's dog, Strohmian,
   when she never mentioned it during the story. Eckbert encounters
   Walther in the woods while on a ride and shoots his friend. Eckbert
   returns home to find his wife as she dies from a guilty conscience.

   After the death of his wife and friend, Eckbert finds solace in
   frequent excursions from his home and befriends a knight named Hugo.
   Eckbert suffers from a guilty conscience after witnessing his wife's
   death and murdering his friend. He becomes paranoid and increasingly
   finds it difficult to disentangle the perception of reality with his
   imagination. Hugo appears to be his murdered friend Walter and he
   suspects that Hugo may not be his friend and reveals the secret of
   Walther's murder. Eckbert fearfully flees into the forest and stumbles
   upon the place where the old woman found Bertha as a little girl and
   led her through the forest. He hears a dog barking. He recognizes the
   sound of the wondrous bird singing. Eventually he meets the old woman
   who immediately recognizes him. She curses him for Bertha's theft and
   abrupt departure. The old woman tells Eckbert that she was Walther and
   Hugo, at the same time, and that he and Bertha are half-siblings from
   the same noble father. Bertha had been sent away from home to live with
   a shepherd. This news of his incestuous relationship deeply affects
   Eckbert's already weakened constitution. He quickly descends into
   paranoia, delusion, and madness shrieking in agony before he dies.
