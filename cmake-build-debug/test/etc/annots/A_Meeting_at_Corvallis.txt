   Mike (Lord Bear) and Signe Havel of the Bearkillers and Juniper
   Mackenzie of Clan Mackenzie travel to Corvallis, a neutral city-state,
   to convince them to join in resisting the PPA. Meanwhile, the Dunedain
   Rangers have captured a major knight of the PPA leading a band of
   raiders into their territory and take him to Corvallis for his trial.
   Sandra Arminger and her servant/assassin Tiphaine also travel to
   Corvallis to speak in defense of the PPA. Sandra sends Tiphaine to kill
   the knight so he cannot be used as evidence against the PPA. Tiphaine
   successfully kills the knight and flees the scene even though she is
   ambushed by the Rangers. At the Corvallis Faculty Senate, the governing
   body of Corvallis originally composed of professors from Oregon State
   University, the allied forces are unable to convince Corvallis to side
   against the PPA; but they are successful in getting Corvallis to
   recognize the Dunedain Rangers.

   Months later, Lord Protector Norman Arminger finally begins his war
   against the Bearkillers, Mount Angel, and Clan Mackenzie. Arminger
   divides his forces into three armies and dispatches them to destroy the
   three factions. While Corvallis refuses to help, two thousand Corvallis
   volunteers arrive to reinforce the Bearkillers and help them win their
   battle against Protectorate forces. The Central Oregon Ranchers
   Association also pitches in, sending a few hundred light cavalrymen to
   help the MacKenzies break the siege of Mount Angel. The remaining
   Protectorate forces regroup and retreat back to PPA territory.

   Rudi Mackenzie (son of Juniper Mackenzie and Mike Havel) is captured in
   a PPA raid to free Princess Mathilda Arminger, and Sandra entrusts him
   to Tiphaine. Tiphaine takes the two children to her castle, where she
   holds them. Norman Arminger, however, decides to have Rudi captured and
   tortured, and sends one of his knights to collect him. A Ranger rescue
   mission to free Rudi, led by Astrid Larsson, arrives during the
   skirmish between the PPA factions, but Tiphaine is already victorious.
   Tiphaine had sworn vengeance on Astrid for killing Tiphaine's lover,
   Katrina, but Rudi and Mathilda persuade Astrid to leave Tiphaine alive
   and the women abandon their vendetta. Astrid and the Rangers leave with
   Rudi, leaving Mathilda with Tiphaine.

   The war breaks out again and this time the PPA has massed its entire
   army for one decisive battle. Ten thousand PPA lancers, spearmen, and
   crossbowmen take the field against the combined allied army. Lord Bear
   Mike Havel, feeling that the allies may lose the battle, publicly
   challenges Arminger to a personal duel. Arminger, with rebellions back
   home and knowing that looking weak in front of his nobles would destroy
   his nation, accepts the challenge. Havel and Arminger meet each other
   in single combat with lances, swords, and daggers, and after a long
   fight, Havel slays Arminger with a dagger thrust. Havel, however, is
   fatally wounded during the battle, and after giving his final orders
   and messages to his family and closest friends, he dies.

   With both leaders dead, the PPA force begins to break up and return to
   home. Sandra Arminger negotiates a truce with Juniper Mackenzie and the
   remaining Bearkiller leaders. They decide on an annual meeting to be
   held at Corvallis, a peace treaty, and agree that Princess Mathilda and
   Rudi Mackenzie would spend a few months each year in PPA and Mackenzie
   territory until they reach adulthood. Soon after, Mike Havel's funeral
   is held in Bearkiller territory.

   At the end of the book, Juniper has a vision during a Wiccan ceremony
   of an adult Rudi, leading a massive army, that is shouting his
   craft-name, "Artos."^[2]
