   In 2075, teenager Matt Dodson applies to join the prestigious Space
   Patrol. After a number of physical, mental, and ethics tests, he is
   accepted as a cadet. He makes friends with fellow recruits William
   "Tex" Jarman, Venus-born Oscar Jensen, and Pierre Armand from Ganymede.
   His first roommate is Girard Burke, the arrogant son of a wealthy
   spaceship builder. They are transported to the orbiting school ship PRS
   James Randolph for further training. Burke eventually either resigns or
   is asked to leave, and goes into the merchant service, but the
   remainder do well enough to be assigned to working Patrol ships.

   Dodson, Jarman and Jensen ship out on the Aes Triplex. Their first real
   mission is to help search for a missing research vessel, the
   Pathfinder, in the asteroid belt. They find it, but all aboard are
   dead, the unlucky victims of a fast-moving object that punctured the
   ship when the armored outer airlock door was open. Before the accident,
   a researcher on the Pathfinder had found evidence that the planet which
   blew up to form the asteroids was inhabited by an intelligent species,
   and that the explosion had been artificial. The captain of the Aes
   Triplex transfers half the crew to the repaired Pathfinder so that they
   can take the ship and the news of the startling discovery back to Earth
   quickly. With the remainder (including all three cadets), he plots a
   slower, fuel-efficient, elliptical voyage back to Earth.

   Then, he receives an urgent message to investigate an incident on
   Venus. He sends Lieutenant Thurlow and the cadets to the planet's
   surface. The lander touches down on a sinkhole, giving the crew barely
   enough time to get out before it disappears in the mud. With Thurlow
   comatose, injured when the lander fell over, Jensen assumes command. He
   contacts the sentient, usually friendly Venerians, but the entire party
   is taken captive. They soon find out why.

   These particular natives had never seen human beings before, until old
   classmate Burke showed up in a prospecting ship. He had taken the
   matriarch of the local clan hostage when she refused to give him
   permission to exploit a rich deposit of radioactive ores. The locals
   promptly attacked the ship and killed his crew; Burke managed to send a
   message for help before being taken prisoner.

   Jensen gains the matriarch's trust and convinces her that they are
   honorable and civilized, unlike Burke, and the Patrolmen are released.
   Unfortunately, neither the lander nor Burke's ship is flightworthy. To
   their amazement, the matriarch takes the stranded humans to the
   carefully preserved Astarte, the legendary first ship to set out for
   Venus over a century before and thought to have been lost en route.
   According to the log, the crew perished from disease. With the help of
   the natives, the cadets recommission the ship and fly it back to
   Venus's South Pole colony. Dodson is initially disappointed when they
   are not treated as heroes, but then realizes that what they
   accomplished was simply what was expected of Patrolmen.
