   The stories center on Tristen, brought into existence by a magical
   "shaping" by the ancient wizard Mauryl Gestaurien. Called "Kingmaker"
   for his role in the founding of the ruling Marhannen dynasty, Mauryl is
   the last living representative of the great Galasieni race. His once
   formidable power, however, is declining with age. Doubting his own
   abilities, he falters during the act of Tristen's summoning, leaving
   the shaping work partially unfinished.

   Tristen is thereby brought into the world not fully formed. Physically
   he is a normal young man, but he has no memory, knowledge of the world
   around him, or understanding of his personal identity. Mauryl
   deliberately leaves the question of Tristen's identity unanswered, and
   as such Tristen must discover it for himself. They are threatened by a
   dead sorcerer, Hasufin Heltain, an old enemy (and former student) of
   Mauryl who seeks to destroy Tristen and return to living corporeal
   form.

   The first novels in the series describe Tristen's coming of age and his
   developing relationship with Prince Cefwyn, heir to the Marhannen
   throne. Later novels in the series portray Tristen as he comes to
   understand his true origins and the full extent of his powers as he
   confronts his enemy Hasufin.

   Cherryh also dedicates significant effort to the development of
   Cefwyn's character as he also comes of age, ascends to the Marhannen
   throne and confronts the challenges of kingship. Cefwyn must unite the
   fractious nobles of his court and establish his authority over an
   independent-minded church hierarchy while simultaneously defending his
   lands from both internal treachery and external invasion.

   As the series develops, Cherryh continues to intertwine the storylines
   of Tristen and Cefwyn. Tristen becomes a critical bulwark of support
   for the young king, and Cefwyn helps Tristen to find his place in
   society with the grant of a peerage and through the close friendship
   they form. The two are further united by their common enemies, for
   Hasufin attempts to leverage both internal and external opposition to
   Cefwyn as a means to gain power and force a final confrontation with
   Tristen.
