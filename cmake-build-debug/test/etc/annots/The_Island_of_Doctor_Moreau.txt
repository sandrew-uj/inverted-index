   Edward Prendick is an Englishman with a scientific education who
   survives a shipwreck in the southern Pacific Ocean. A passing ship
   called Ipecacuanha takes him aboard and a man named Montgomery revives
   him. Prendick also meets a grotesque bestial native named M'ling who
   appears to be Montgomery's manservant. The ship is transporting a
   number of animals which belong to Montgomery. As they approach the
   island which is Montgomery's destination, the captain demands Prendick
   leave the ship with Montgomery. Montgomery explains that he will not be
   able to host Prendick on the island. Despite this, the captain leaves
   Prendick in a dinghy and sails away. Seeing that the captain has
   abandoned Prendick, Montgomery takes pity and rescues him. As ships
   rarely pass the island, Prendick will be housed in an outer room of an
   enclosed compound.

   The island belongs to Dr. Moreau. Prendick remembers that he has heard
   of Moreau, formerly an eminent physiologist in London whose gruesome
   experiments in vivisection had been publicly exposed, and who fled
   England as a result of his exposure.

   The next day, Moreau begins working on a puma. Prendick gathers that
   Moreau is performing a painful experiment on the animal and its
   anguished cries drive Prendick out into the jungle. While he wanders,
   he comes upon a group of people who seem human but have an unmistakable
   resemblance to swine. As he walks back to the enclosure, he suddenly
   realises he is being followed by a figure in the jungle. He panics and
   flees, and the figure gives chase. As his pursuer bears down on him,
   Prendick manages to stun him with a stone and observes that the pursuer
   is a monstrous hybrid of animal and man. When Prendick returns to the
   enclosure and questions Montgomery, Montgomery refuses to be open with
   him. After failing to get an explanation, Prendick finally gives in and
   takes a sleeping draught.

   Prendick awakes the next morning with the previous night's activities
   fresh in his mind. Seeing that the door to Moreau's operating room has
   been left unlocked, he walks in to find a humanoid form lying in
   bandages on the table before he is ejected by a shocked and angry
   Moreau. He believes that Moreau has been vivisecting humans and that he
   is the next test subject. He flees into the jungle where he meets an
   Ape-Man who takes him to a colony of similarly half-human/half-animal
   creatures. Their leader is a large grey unspecified creature named the
   Sayer of the Law who has him recite a strange litany called the Law
   that involves prohibitions against bestial behavior and praise for
   Moreau.

     Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not men?
     Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are we not men?
     Not to eat Fish or Flesh; that is the Law. Are we not men?
     Not to claw the Bark of Trees; that is the Law. Are we not men?
     Not to chase other Men; that is the Law. Are we not men?^[7]

   Suddenly, Dr. Moreau bursts into the colony looking for Prendick, but
   Prendick escapes to the jungle. He makes for the ocean where he plans
   to drown himself rather than allow Moreau to experiment on him. Moreau
   explains that the creatures called the Beast Folk were not formerly
   men, but rather animals. Prendick returns to the enclosure where Moreau
   explains that he has been on the island for eleven years and has been
   striving to make a complete transformation of an animal to a human. He
   explains that while he is getting closer to perfection, his subjects
   have a habit of reverting to their animal form and behaviour. Moreau
   regards the pain he inflicts as insignificant and an unavoidable side
   effect in the name of his scientific experiments. He also states that
   pain is an animalistic instinct that one who is truly human cannot
   have, cutting his thigh with a penknife with no apparent reaction, to
   further prove his point.

   One day, Prendick and Montgomery encounter a half-eaten rabbit. Since
   eating flesh and tasting blood are strong prohibitions, Dr. Moreau
   calls an assembly of the Beast Folk and identifies the Leopard-Man (the
   same one that chased Prendick the first time he wandered into the
   jungle) as the transgressor. Knowing that he will be sent back to Dr.
   Moreau's compound for more painful sessions of vivisection, the
   Leopard-Man flees. Eventually, the group corners him in some
   undergrowth, but Prendick takes pity and shoots him to spare him from
   further suffering. Prendick also believes that although the Leopard-Man
   was seen breaking several laws, such as drinking water bent down like
   an animal, chasing men (Prendick), and running on all fours, the
   Leopard-Man was not solely responsible for the deaths of the rabbits.
   It was also the Hyena-Swine, the next most dangerous Beast Man on the
   island. Dr. Moreau is furious that Prendick killed the Leopard-Man but
   can do nothing about the situation.

   As time passes, Prendick becomes inured to the grotesqueness of the
   Beast Folk. However one day, the half-finished puma woman rips free of
   her restraints and escapes from the lab. Dr. Moreau pursues her, but
   the two end up fighting each other, leading to their mutual deaths.
   Montgomery breaks down and decides to share his alcohol with the Beast
   Folk. Prendick resolves to leave the island, but later hears a
   commotion outside in which Montgomery, his servant M'ling, and the
   Sayer of the Law die after a scuffle with the Beast Folk. At the same
   time, the compound burns down because Prendick has knocked over a lamp.
   With no chance of saving any of the provisions stored in the enclosure,
   Prendick realizes that Montgomery has also destroyed the only boats on
   the island during the night.

   Prendick lives with the Beast Folk on the island for months after the
   deaths of Moreau and Montgomery. As the time goes by, the Beast Folk
   increasingly revert to their original animal instincts, beginning to
   hunt the island's rabbits, returning to walking on all fours, and
   leaving their shared living areas for the wild. They cease to follow
   Prendick's instructions. Eventually the Hyena-Swine kills Prendick's
   faithful companion, the Dog-Man created from a St. Bernard. With help
   from the Sloth Creature, Prendick shoots the Hyena-Swine in
   self-defence.

   Prendick's efforts to build a raft have been unsuccessful. Luckily for
   him, a lifeboat that carries two corpses drifts onto the beach (perhaps
   the captain of the ship that picked Prendick up and a sailor).^[8]
   Prendick uses the boat to leave the island and is picked up three days
   later. When he tells his story, he is thought to be mad. So he feigns
   amnesia.

   Upon his return to England, Prendick is no longer comfortable in the
   presence of humans, all of whom seem to him to be about to revert to an
   animal state. He leaves London and lives in near-solitude in the
   countryside, devoting himself to chemistry as well as astronomy in the
   studies of which he finds some peace.
