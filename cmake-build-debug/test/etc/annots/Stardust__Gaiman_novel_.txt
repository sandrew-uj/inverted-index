   On the outskirts of Wall, a small town in rural England, the Faerie
   Market is held every nine years on the other side of the wall dividing
   Faerie -- a mystical realm of magic -- from our world and for which the
   town of Wall is named. As the book begins, the market has just begun
   and the town is filled with visitors and vendors. A young man named
   Dunstan Thorn rents out his cottage to a stranger in exchange for his
   "Heart's Desire," in addition to a monetary payment. The next day in
   the market, he meets Una, a beautiful woman imprisoned by a witch named
   Semele. He purchases a glass snowdrop from Una with a kiss, and gives
   the flower to his fiancee Daisy. Enthralled by her beauty during the
   encounter, Dunstan later meets Una in the woods that night and makes
   love to her. A month later, Dunstan marries Daisy as planned. In
   February (a little over nine months later), he receives a baby in a
   basket -- his and Una's son, Tristran.

   Eighteen years after these events, Tristran -- now a young man with a
   half-sister named Louisa -- seeks the love of Victoria Forester, the
   town beauty. One night, while Tristran is walking her home from the
   shop where he works, he sees a shooting star land in Faerie, and he
   vows to bring it to her in exchange for a kiss, and perhaps her hand in
   marriage. Thinking that he will never actually do it, Victoria promises
   to do whatever he asks if he brings her the star. Tristran tells his
   father of the bargain, and Dunstan gives Tristran the snowdrop, as well
   as helping him pass the guards at the wall by alluding to his faerie
   heritage. Tristran enters Faerie and begins his search for the star.

   At Stormhold, in Faerie, the King of Stormhold gathers his sons to
   determine who will be his heir; he hurls the Power of Stormhold, a
   topaz that marks its bearer as the ruler of the land, into the sky,
   knocking that selfsame star from the sky. He then dies, and his sons
   leave together. Septimus departs on his own after poisoning Tertius at
   a nearby inn. Neither of the remaining brothers is aware that their
   other slain brothers, each one killed for the crown, are with them in
   ghost form.

   In a small, grey house in the woods, three ancient and mighty witches
   known as the Lillim learn of the fallen star by reading the entrails of
   a dead goat, and the eldest of the Lilim consumes their last reserves
   of "years", later revealed to be the heart of another fallen star, to
   become young again. She meets a farm boy, Brevis, at a crossroads,
   takes his goat, and transforms him into a second goat, using the two
   animals to pull her small chariot.

   Tristran meets a small hairy man who helps him through the woods. After
   Tristran helps them escape deadly trees called serewood, he learns he
   has the ability to find any location in Faerie. Tristran is taunted by
   tiny faeries, who say that he is "soon to face his true love's scorn."
   The hairy man gives Tristran a new outfit, a silver chain like the one
   used to imprison Una, and a candle-stub which allows one to travel
   great distances quickly while it burns, which he explains by
   referencing the nursery rhyme "How Many Miles to Babylon?".

   Tristran uses the candle to quickly reach the fallen star, but is
   surprised to find that the star is actually a young woman named Yvaine,
   whose leg was broken in the fall. Yvaine hurls mud at him and
   continuously insults him. He resolves to take her to Victoria anyway,
   tying her to him with the chain. However, the candle goes out before he
   can return, so the two sleep for the night.

   The next morning, Tristran tells Yvaine about his promise to Victoria
   and his intention to bring Yvaine to her. Tristran makes Yvaine a
   simple crutch to help her walk as her broken leg hinders her movement.
   They arrive at a clearing where they witness a fight between a lion and
   a unicorn over a golden crown. Yvaine asks Tristran to help the Unicorn
   when the Lion was about to kill it. Tristran, remembering the old
   nursery rhyme, The Lion and the Unicorn, picks up the crown and gives
   it to the Lion. With the crown upon its head, the Lion slips away into
   the forest. Tristran and Yvaine spend the night at the clearing beside
   the wounded Unicorn. Yvaine escapes on the Unicorn when Tristran leaves
   in search of food.

   The witch-queen, on her search for the Star, encounters Madam Semele.
   They share a meal and Madam Semele gives the witch-queen meat cooked
   with Limbus grass, which causes anyone who tastes it to speak nothing
   but the truth, forcing her to reveal the purpose of her journey. The
   enraged witch-queen puts a curse on her, which prevents her from
   seeing, touching or perceiving the star in any way and causing Semele
   to forget their meeting the moment the witch-queen leaves.

   On discovering that Yvaine is gone, a despondent and regretful Tristran
   spends the night under a tree. Tristran talks to a tree who says that
   Pan, the spirit of the forest, told her to help him. The tree tells
   Tristran that there are people looking for Yvaine and that there is a
   path in the forest with a carriage coming down it that Tristran can't
   miss. Then it gives Tristran a leaf and says to listen to it when he
   needs help the most. Tristran runs to catch the carriage and nearly
   misses it but for a tree that has fallen in the carriage's path.
   Tristran meets Primus, the driver of the carriage, and persuades him to
   allow Tristran to ride in the carriage.

   In the mountains the witch-queen transforms her chariot into an inn to
   catch Yvaine, who is coming her way. She turns the goat into a man, and
   the goat who used to be Brevis into a girl. Yvaine falls for the trap,
   and the witch-queen is preparing to carve out her heart when Tristran
   and Primus, who have also been attracted by the inn, arrive. The
   witch-queen decides to delay killing Yvaine until she has dealt with
   the two unwanted guests. She attempts to poison Tristran while he is
   tending to the horses, but the unicorn, which is also lodged in the
   stable, warns him just in time. He rushes back to the inn, but is too
   late to warn Primus. However he is able to rescue Yvaine by forming a
   makeshift candle from the remnants of the magical candle he had
   obtained earlier, burning his left hand in the process. Shortly
   afterwards, Septimus arrives and finds Primus' body. He sets off in
   search of the witch-queen, to fulfill an obligation to avenge his slain
   brother, and the topaz, to claim his birthright as the last surviving
   son of Stormhold.

   Tristran and Yvaine escape the witch-queen, but find themselves in an
   almost equally perilous situation. They walk past many scenes in the
   light of the candle, but eventually end up stranded on a cloud, miles
   above Faerie. They are rescued by the crew of a passing airborne ship.
   The captain of the ship agrees to help them on their way back to Wall,
   hinting that he is part of a mysterious 'fellowship' that wants to help
   Tristran for some unspecified reason. Tristran expresses regret for
   chaining Yvaine up. The star reveals that while Tristran no longer
   intends to force her to accompany him to Wall, the custom of her people
   dictates that, because he has saved her life, she is nonetheless
   obliged to follow him.

   Upon parting company with the ship and its crew, Tristran and Yvaine
   set off for Wall, and, after several adventures, encounter Madam
   Semele. Because of the witch-queen's curse, Madam Semele is unable to
   see Yvaine, but she agrees to transport Tristran the rest of the way to
   Wall, as she is on her way to the market herself. Tristran obtains a
   promise from Madam Semele that he will not be harmed, will receive
   board and lodging, and will arrive at Wall in the same manner and
   condition in which he departed. This promise, however, does not prevent
   her from transforming him into a dormouse for the duration of the
   journey. The star also rides on Madam Semele's wagon, unbeknownst to
   the old woman.

   Septimus seeks revenge on the witch-queen for killing Primus, but is
   himself killed by his intended victim, without ever reclaiming the
   topaz. Tristran (now returned to his human form), Yvaine, Madam Semele
   and the witch-queen all arrive at the Wall market.

   Tristran leaves Yvaine and crosses back into Wall, to tell Victoria
   that he has returned with the star. Meanwhile, Yvaine realises she has
   fallen in love with Tristran and, if he fulfills his promise to bring
   her to Victoria, she will not only lose him to another woman, but upon
   leaving Faerie, will be transformed into a piece of rock.

   Upon meeting Tristran, a dismayed Victoria (who is a month or two
   pregnant but does not yet know it) reveals she is already engaged to
   Monday, Tristran's old employer, and that she never believed that
   Tristran would fulfill his promise. She regretfully tells Tristran that
   she will keep her promise and marry him. Tristran, not wishing to force
   Victoria to marry him against her will, reminds her the promise wasn't
   to marry him, it was to give him anything he desired, and that he
   desires that she marry her own love, Monday.

   Tristran returns to Yvaine at the fair. She is delighted to learn that
   Victoria is to be married to someone else, and Tristran reveals that he
   returns her love for him.

   Una informs Madam Semele that she will soon be free, as her enslavement
   ends when the moon loses her child (Yvaine), if it happens in a week
   when two Mondays come together (the marriage of Victoria and Monday).
   The silver chain that binds Una finally fades away, and she demands
   payment for her services, which Madam Semele must give on pain of
   losing her powers.

   Una seeks out Tristran and Yvaine and reveals her true identity as Lady
   Una, only daughter of the Eighty-First Lord of Stormhold, and
   Tristran's mother, and thus Tristran is rightfully the last male heir
   of Stormhold. She instructs Tristran to ask Yvaine for the topaz she
   carries, and through its magic the power of Stormhold passes to
   Tristran. However he declines to immediately return to Stormhold,
   leaving Lady Una to reign in his stead while he and Yvaine travel
   around Faerie. But before Yvaine and Tristran can set off on their
   journey, an impossibly aged hag turns up wishing to speak to Yvaine.
   She reveals herself as the witch-queen, but Yvaine, no longer fearful,
   tells her the good news that she has given her heart to Tristran. The
   witch-queen claims she'd have done better to give it to the Lillim,
   since Tristran is sure to break it as all men do. The witch-queen then
   leaves them forever, fearful of the cruelty her sisters will inflict
   upon her for failing.

   Many years later, Tristran and Yvaine finally return to Stormhold, and
   Tristran assumes his duties as the Lord of Stormhold. When he
   eventually grows old and dies, Yvaine continues to reign as the
   immortal ruler of Stormhold.
