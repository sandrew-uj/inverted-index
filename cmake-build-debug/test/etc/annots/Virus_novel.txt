   A US space mission in 1964 gathers a group of microbes in Earth orbit
   and are later recovered by American biowarfare researchers. Two
   microbes are found to be coccus-shaped supergerms capable of surviving
   in absolute zero and have the potential to grow exponentially in
   terrestrial conditions. One of the researchers, Dr Meyer, discovers the
   germ's regenerative ability and tries to stop work on the project.
   However, a sample of the germs is stolen and sent to Britain's Germ
   Warfare Research Laboratory in Porton Down for further development.

   In February 196X (actually implied as 1970, later to be known as the
   Year of the Calamity), a scientist at Porton Down smuggles a sample of
   the developed virus, codenamed MM88, and gives it to a group of men who
   have been tasked to bring it to Dr. Leisener, a Czech molecular
   biologist who is skilled at developing antidotes for it. The scientist,
   Dr. Karlsky, insists that the germ must never be exposed to warm
   temperatures. However, the men double-cross him and an assistant later
   kills him under the guise of a suicide. The group flies out of England
   bound for a rendezvous with US intelligence agents in Turkey. They
   never make it; their plane crashes into the Alps in the middle of a
   snowstorm and the vial holding the virus breaks open. The crash site is
   investigated but investigators could not link it with the theft of the
   virus.

   The virus, which is designed to piggyback with other existing illnesses
   and make them more lethal, begins to reproduce with the advent of
   spring in the Alps. Although some local communities have been reporting
   small animals suddenly dropping dead in their area, an Italian matinee
   idol's death in an auto crash in early March sparks media attention.
   His girlfriend dies shortly after a press conference eight days later,
   but not before she reveals that the actor died of a heart attack just
   before the accident despite being in good health. Several European
   countries are also reporting sudden deaths of important livestock.

   Over the second quarter, outbreaks of influenza and polio take place
   around the world, and news of random heart attacks even hog the papers.
   Another disease also kills off chickens and their eggs just when
   scientists needed to acquire large stocks of eggs for developing
   vaccines. The outbreaks of something called Tibetan flu begin to
   inflict massive casualties, with a number of countries reporting
   hundreds of thousands killed from random heart attacks. The Soviet
   Union's premier and vice-premier die of the illness, and Meyer is
   forcibly committed to the Sloan-Kettering Institute to prevent
   revealing the truth about the virus. Things are also worse in the
   scientific community; the fact that no one except the now-dead Porton
   Down researchers know of the existence of the space microbes (which
   have been suppressed for secrecy reasons) cripples efforts to develop a
   vaccine. Nearly all life on Earth are dead of the disease by the end of
   August.

   As the pandemic spreads worldwide, meanwhile, the staff of several
   international research stations in Antarctica begin to pool their
   resources towards creating a new society in the ice under the so-called
   "Supreme Council of Antarctica (SCA)." A scientist at Sloan-Kettering
   gets in touch with Dr. Meyer and is able to piece together all
   information about the virus for broadcast to the Antarctic bases before
   he dies. A US Polaris ballistic missile submarine, the USS Nereid, and
   a Soviet sub, the T-232, make contact with the SCA and are welcomed
   into an improvised submarine base in Hope Bay.

   Over the next four years, the community in Antarctica - an estimated
   10,000 strong - gradually breaks down national affiliations and learn
   to live together while tapping the continent's natural resources. The
   large community only has 16 women - all of childbearing age, and the
   SCA moves to have them undergo consensual sex for procreation purposes.
   At the same time, the two submarines are sent on research duty around
   the world, giving Japanese seismologist Yoshizumi time to perfect a
   special method for predicting earthquakes.

   In late 1974, one of Yoshizumi's reports attract the SCA leadership's
   attention. He briefs them about a powerful earthquake somewhere in
   Alaska that is slated to take place in around spring 1975. Admiral
   Conway and Major Carter of the US reveals that the earthquake has the
   potential to destroy a Distant Early Warning Line station in the state
   and in the process trip the Automatic Reaction System (ARS), a command
   computer for the US strategic arsenal. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman
   General Garland activated the system before his death in the closing
   stages of the pandemic. The two American officers admit that the ARS
   was borne out of hardline anti-Soviet policies; a new regime that took
   office in 1969 was working towards a nuclear disarmament deal with the
   Soviets around the time of the pandemic. The Soviet contingent admits
   that some of their missiles may be targeted at a now-decommissioned US
   rocket base in Antarctica.

   In a special mission codenamed Operation Fireman, Yoshizumi and Major
   Carter volunteer to go to the ARS command bunker underneath the White
   House; two Soviet volunteers go to Moscow aboard the T-232 to shut down
   their own version of the ARS. Yoshizumi and Major Carter - who have
   been inoculated by French scientist Dr Henri Louis De la Tour with an
   experimental vaccine derived from samples of the virus irradiated with
   neutron energy - arrive in Washington at roughly the same time as the
   Alaska earthquake. They scramble to get down to the ARS bunker - just
   as the system goes into firing status. Already reeling from the pain of
   a snake bite and seeing a young skeleton resembling his dead daughter,
   Carter commits suicide and Yoshizumi stays in the bunker, alerting the
   Nereid to head for open water immediately as he sits out the nuclear
   exchange. The Soviet team's fate is left unknown, although it is later
   revealed by de la Tour that no Soviet missiles hit Antarctica and most
   of the warheads were actually neutron weapons; their radioactive rays
   mutate the virus into a form that does not affect humans. It is implied
   that the Nereid survived the nuclear strike.

   Two advance parties of survivors arrive in southern Argentina over the
   winter of 1978 and 1979. A third and much bigger group of survivors
   follow in December 1979. This group is stunned to see Yoshizumi emerge
   from hiding nearby - he spent the past several years trekking all the
   way from Washington, proving that de la Tour's vaccine worked. In
   August 1980, ten full years after the pandemic, the human colony in
   Argentina prepares to send an exploration team into the interior.
