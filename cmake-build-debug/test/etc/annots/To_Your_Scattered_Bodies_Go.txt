   British adventurer Richard Francis Burton dies on Earth and is revived
   in mid-air in a vast dark room filled with human bodies, some only
   half-formed. There, he is confronted by men in a flying vehicle who
   then blast him with a weapon.

   He next awakes upon the shores of a mysterious river, naked and
   hairless. All around him are other people in a similar situation.
   Shortly after they awaken, a nearby structure, nicknamed a
   "grailstone," causes food and other supplies to appear in the "grails"
   bound to each individual. Burton quickly attracts a group of
   companions: the neanderthal Kazzintuitruaabemss (nicknamed Kazz), the
   science fiction author Peter Jairus Frigate, and Alice Liddell. Among
   these is the extraterrestrial Monat Grrautut, earlier part of a small
   group of beings from Tau Ceti who had arrived on Earth in the early
   21st century. When one of their number was accidentally killed by
   humans, their spaceship automatically killed most of the people on
   Earth. Frigate and others alive at the time confirm Monat's story.
   Retreating into the nearby woods for safety, Burton's party chew gum
   provided by their grails, and discover that this gum is a powerful
   hallucinogen. As days and weeks pass, people's physical wants are
   provided for by the grails, which eventually produce a set of cloths
   used for clothing. Rumors reach Burton's region that the river
   continues seemingly forever. One night, Burton is visited by a
   mysterious cloaked figure, whom Burton dubs "The Mysterious Stranger",
   who explains that he is one of the beings who has constructed this
   world and resurrected humanity on its shores, and tells Burton to
   approach the headwaters of the river.

   After setting off, Burton's group encounters many adventures, but are
   enslaved by a riverbank kingdom run by Tullus Hostilius and Hermann
   Goering, against whom Burton leads a successful revolt. Goering himself
   is killed by Alice. After the revolt, Burton is part of the nation's
   ruling council. Later, the protagonists discover a person among them
   who they conclude is an agent of the beings who created this world.
   Before the man can be questioned, he dies of no apparent cause. An
   autopsy reveals a small device planted in the man's brain which
   apparently allowed him to kill himself at will. Burton is visited by
   the Mysterious Stranger and is warned that the beings who created this
   world, whom the Stranger refers to as "Ethicals", are close to
   capturing Burton. Desperate to escape, Burton kills himself to be
   resurrected elsewhere in the river valley, and continues thus to
   explore it. He often finds himself resurrected near Hermann Goering,
   who undergoes a moral and religious conversion and joins the pacifist
   Church of the Second Chance. After many resurrections, Burton finds
   himself resurrected not in the river but in the Dark Tower at the
   headwaters, and is interrogated by a council of Ethicals to discover
   the identity of Burton's "Mysterious Stranger". After fruitlessly
   questioning him, the Ethicals inform him that they will return him to
   the river valley, remembering nothing of themselves, and restore him to
   his friends, but the Mysterious Stranger prevents them from removing
   his memory and Burton resolves to continue pursuing the truth about the
   Ethicals and their intentions for the Riverworld.
