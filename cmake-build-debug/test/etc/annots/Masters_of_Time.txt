   Masters of Time is a collection of two science fiction novellas by A.
   E. van Vogt. It was first published in 1950 by Fantasy Press in an
   edition of 4,034 copies. It contains the unrelated novellas "Recruiting
   Station" (here retitled "Masters of Time") and "The Changeling". The
   latter features a recurring character of van Vogt's called Pendrake.
   Both works of fiction originally appeared in the magazine Astounding
   SF. More confusingly, the title novella has also appeared on the third
   title of "Earth's Last Fotress".
