   The Chanur novels are a series of five science fiction novels, forming
   three separate stories, written by American author C. J. Cherryh and
   published by DAW Books between 1981 and 1992. The first novel in the
   series is The Pride of Chanur (1981), which was nominated for both the
   Hugo and Locus Awards in 1983. The Pride of Chanur, originally a
   stand-alone story, was followed by the Chanur's Venture trilogy (also
   referred to as "Chanur's Revenge"), Chanur's Venture (1984), which was
   shortlisted for a Locus Award in 1985; The Kif Strike Back (1985)
   and Chanur's Homecoming (1986). These were followed by a later sequel,
   Chanur's Legacy (1992). The five novels were also published in two
   omnibus editions: the first three in The Chanur Saga in 2000 and the
   next two in Chanur's Endgame in 2007.

   An abridged version of The Pride of Chanur was published in the Science
   Fiction Digest in 1983.

   Set in Cherryh's Alliance-Union universe, but in a different region of
   space inhabited by numerous alien spacefaring civilizations, the Chanur
   novels are unusually realistic examples of space opera, with
   ship-to-ship shooting minimized in favor of coercion, manipulation,
   politics, pride contests, and clashing economic interests, driven in
   many cases by species-to-species miscommunication and misunderstanding.
