   The book continues to follow Ethan Wate, a teenage boy living in the
   small Southern town of Gatlin. He's in love with Lena Duchannes, a girl
   with the ability to work great magic - something she used to bring
   Ethan back to life after the events in the preceding book. She's
   managed to avoid having to make the choice between dark or light,
   however this doesn't mean that she is free to live her life as she
   chooses.
