   The year is 2452. Festina Ramos is an Explorer, assigned to the
   Technocracy Fleet ship Jacaranda. Her specific physical "qualification"
   for her job is a large port-wine birthmark on her right cheek. She and
   her fellow Explorer and partner Yarrun Derigha (who is missing half his
   jaw) are the two Explorers assigned to the ship; they lead the isolated
   existence typical of Explorers, isolated from the healthy and
   attractive members of the fleet as from the "beautiful people" of the
   larger society.

   Then Festina and Yarrun are plunged into a crisis: they are assigned to
   escort a Fleet admiral named Chee to planet Melaquin. Melaquin is the
   great question mark in the Technocracy's domain: for forty years
   Explorers have landed there, only to lose contact and disappear, cause
   unknown. The High Council has now acquired the habit of sending its
   troublesome admirals to Melaquin in the company of a team of Explorers,
   to rid itself of embarrassments without scandal or controversy. The
   fact that Explorers are lost in the process is accepted--since
   Explorers are expendable.

   Admiral Chee is precisely the kind of embarrassment the high council
   wants to dispose of, quickly and quietly. Well beyond the century mark
   in age, when doses of Youthboost are no longer effective in prolonging
   his life and health, he is "clearly unstable, possibly senile"--or else
   "suffering from Don't-give-a-shit-itis". Though they try to avoid the
   duty, and then concoct a plan of escape from their apparent sentence to
   oblivion, Festina and Yarrun must accompany Chee to the surface of
   Melaqiuin. There, things go quickly and badly wrong: Festina
   accidentally kills Yarrun while attempting an emergency tracheotomy,
   Chee dies of a stroke, and Festina is cut off from her ship, alone on
   Melaquin.

   The planet reveals itself to be amazingly Earth-like--so much so that
   it is clearly not natural, but a result of terraforming and genetic
   modification. Festina quickly meets one of the inhabitants of the
   planet--"A nude woman made of glass...like an Art Deco figurine." Their
   meeting does not go as the Explorer corps intends for first-contact
   situations. Eventually, though, the two establish contact; the glass
   woman introduces herself: "My name is Oar. An oar is an implement used
   to propel boats." She has learned English from the previous Explorers
   who came to the planet. A product of sophisticated genetic engineering,
   she is human, but flawlessly beautiful and possessing enhanced strength
   and intelligence; yet she has the emotional maturity of a spoiled
   child. Through Oar, Festina gains contact with the dying subsurface
   civilization that lingers on Melaquin, begins to unravel the mysteries
   of the planet, and pursues the trail of the Explorers who came before
   her.

   Now "friends", Festina and Oar set off in search of the other Explorers
   and the truth behind Admiral Chee and the high council's involvement
   with Melaquin. The two find the Explorers building a spaceship; if the
   Explorers can get to interstellar space and send a distress call, the
   rules of the League may mandate that they be rescued and returned to
   society--if the Fleet does not stop them first. In due course Festina
   meets an old flame (a cross between a schoolgirl crush and the love of
   her life), who reveals himself to be a profound danger instead of a
   welcome ally. Oar sacrifices herself for her friend, and Festina
   manages to return to the Fleet and the Technocracy in a way she could
   never have anticipated.
