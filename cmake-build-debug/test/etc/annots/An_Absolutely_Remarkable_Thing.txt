   Protagonist April May discovers a large robot sculpture in Midtown
   Manhattan. She and her friend Andy Skampt decide to film it and post
   the video online, which goes viral and makes April an overnight
   celebrity. All over the world identical structures--known as
   "Carls"--have appeared in major cities at exactly the same time.

   It turns out that there are 64 Carls distributed in cities across the
   globe, which have miraculously appeared at once. As well, gradually
   almost all of humanity find themselves entering an interactive Dream
   when they sleep, within an identical landscape filled with puzzles that
   provide clues when solved. Over the course of a few months April and
   her friends work to solve the codes and riddles of the Carls through
   the Dream.

   Several governments restrict access to Carls, leading April to become
   more politically active, which leads to April being interviewed on one
   news show alongside the conservative pundit Peter Petrawicki, who has
   written an already bestselling 20-page book called Invaded arguing that
   the Carls, representing a foreign invader, could be dangerous. For the
   following months, April cultivates a friendly persona, and writes her
   own book, saying that people should use the social internet in a
   positive way to work together at solving the sequences, some of which
   require specific knowledge and collaboration.

   April then tries to solve the final clue, a unique sequence only she
   has access to, which would complete the vector image. After she
   discloses to the public that the 767 sequence exists, Robin tells her
   that the Defenders have solved it. Miranda gives April the apparent
   solution: a nearby address and the words, "Only April. No One Else." In
   her haste to beat the Defenders to the solution, April rushes to the
   address against Maya's advice, where she finds a large empty warehouse.
   She live-streams herself on Facebook, expecting to communicate with
   Carl. The warehouse is a trap, however, the product of tampered hex
   numbers.

   April is locked in the warehouse, which becomes engulfed in flames.
   Facebook commentators realize that the lyrics to a song playing in the
   warehouse--David Bowie's "Golden Years"--have been changed to say, "In
   every town around the world each of us must be touched with gold". In
   an epiphany, April tells her hundred-million-strong worldwide audience
   to touch a sample of gold to each of the Carls simultaneously. The
   police tell April to break a window and jump out, but after she does
   so, a burning wooden beam falls on, crushes, and presumably kills
   April.

   April, suddenly transported into the Dream, talks to Carl and learns
   that Carl indeed arrived to observe humanity. In addition, Carl
   specifically picked April to make First Contact.

   In the real world, New York Carl launches into the air, and every Carl
   in the world simultaneously vanishes. In the next few weeks, the world
   reacts to April's death, and The Defenders are completely discredited
   for their actions. Eventually, the world returns to normal. Months
   later, Andy hears a knock at his door and receives a text from April
   saying, "Knock Knock".
