   Asa Leventhal's wife Mary has left the city for a few weeks in order to
   help her elderly mother move from Baltimore to her old family home in
   the South. While she is away, Leventhal must take of many tasks of
   caring for himself which his wife would ordinarily undertake for him.
   The action of the story begins when Leventhal is at his job as a
   copy-editor and receives a frantic phone call from his sister-in-law.
   She tells him that his nephew is terribly ill and that she desperately
   needs his assistance. During their conversation we learn that Asa's
   brother Max is a negligent husband and father who has practically
   abandoned his wife and two sons for itinerant work in Texas. His family
   subsists on the money he sends to them.

   On his way to his brother's apartment, Leventhal reflects on the
   annoyance of being disturbed at work and the shameful treatment which
   Max is visiting upon his young family. But these reflections quickly
   take on a tone of self-reproach as Leventhal briefly admits to himself
   that he has allowed his obligation to this extended family to lapse
   inexcusably. Throughout the novel, Leventhal flirts with the
   possibility of widening his arc of responsibility to include humans
   other than himself and his wife. Usually, however, he finds a way to
   preserve his positive image of himself and to shirk responsibility for
   others.

   This theme is expanded one evening when Leventhal, while walking in the
   park, is abruptly confronted by a man whose face he is unable
   immediately to place. Slowly, through conversation and subterfuge, the
   stranger reveals himself to be an old acquaintance named Kirby Allbee.
   Leventhal initially regards Allbee, who looks down on his luck, with a
   mixture of alarm and pity, but is swiftly put on guard, for Allbee's
   stream of false courtesy is barbed with anti-semitism, and it emerges
   that Allbee holds Leventhal responsible for his having lost his job at
   some point in the past.

   As they stand there, Leventhal scrambles to recall the details of their
   acquaintance. He does recall Allbee's references to a party at which
   Allbee had angered Leventhal with anti-semitic remarks, and also that,
   while looking for a job himself, he had had a disastrous interview with
   Allbee's old boss. But Allbee has clearly become a 'crank' and a drunk,
   and Leventhal at first rejects out of hand Allbee's accusation that
   Leventhal's disastrous interview has lost him his job. Allbee asserts
   that Leventhal's angry behavior at the interview was deliberate
   provocation, payback for Allbee's anti-semitic remarks at the party,
   directed at Leventhal's close friend, Dan Harkavy, who had nonetheless
   contacted Allbee to help secure the disastrous interview for Leventhal.

   Allbee confronts Leventhal several more times over the following weeks
   and it is revealed that in recent years Allbee has led a life of
   dissipation and poverty. The loss of his job, his wife's subsequent
   decision to leave him and her ultimate death in an auto accident have
   left him without resources. Leventhal mulls over his angry behavior at
   the interview and begins, despite the fact that Allbee is stalking him
   and spying on him and eventually turns up on his doorstep late at
   night, to accept some degree of responsibility. He enters into painful
   introspection about his stance toward others and interpretations of
   their behavior. We learn that Leventhal's mother was institutionalized
   for mental illness, that Leventhal's 'nerves' are shot, and thus
   despite Allbee's alarming behavior the reader accepts Leventhal's
   doubts about his own assessments of people's motives.

   Interwoven with his struggles with Allbee are Leventhal's uneasy
   interactions with the family of his brother Max. After his initial
   visit to their lowly apartment, Leventhal is convinced that Max has
   neglected his young wife and children unconscionably and he resolves to
   give Max a piece of his mind. Leventhal convinces his sister-in-law to
   allow her son to be admitted to a hospital for treatment. When the
   young boy takes a turn for the worse, Max returns to the city just at
   the time of his son's death.

   Bellow uses the twin events of the death of Leventhal's nephew and the
   jarring conflict with Allbee to portray a period of self-examination
   and growth in the life of the protagonist. Although his tangles with
   Allbee nearly end in disaster, he parts with his brother on good terms,
   and in a final chapter, we learn that he has been promoted, looks
   younger despite graying hair, and is about to become a father.

   The end describes a chance meeting between Leventhal and his old
   tormentor Allbee--both early-middle-aged, in a theatre, just before the
   final act. Allbee's fortunes are superficially reversed: he is dating a
   Hollywood actress and is richly attired. Leventhal is dismayed when
   Allbee hails him, but Allbee comes close to apologizing for his past
   aggression, saying that now he has learned that 'the world wasn't made
   exactly for me' and that he has come to terms with 'whoever runs
   things'. But since Allbee has in the past bruited his belief that 'the
   Jews' run everything, Leventhal's parting words to him are, 'Wait a
   minute, what's your idea of who runs things?' Poignantly, we part with
   Leventhal and his 9-months-pregnant wife in the dark, being shown to
   their seats by an invisible 'usher'.
