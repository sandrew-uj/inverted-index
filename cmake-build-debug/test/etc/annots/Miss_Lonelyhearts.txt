   In the story, Miss Lonelyhearts is an unnamed male newspaper columnist
   writing an advice column for the lovelorn and lonesome, a duty that the
   other newspaper staff considers a joke. As Miss Lonelyhearts reads
   letters from desperate New Yorkers, he feels terribly burdened and
   falls into a cycle of deep depression, accompanied by heavy drinking
   and occasional bar fights. He is also the victim of the pranks and
   cynical advice of Shrike, his feature editor at the newspaper.

   Miss Lonelyhearts tries several approaches to escape the terribly
   painful letters he has to read: religion, trips to the countryside with
   his fiancee Betty, and affairs with Shrike's wife and Mrs. Doyle, a
   reader of his column. However, Miss Lonelyheart's efforts do not seem
   to ameliorate his situation. After his sexual encounter with Mrs.
   Doyle, he meets her husband, a poor crippled man. The Doyles invite
   Miss Lonelyhearts to have dinner with them. When he arrives, Mrs. Doyle
   tries to seduce him again, but he responds by beating her. Mrs. Doyle
   tells her husband that Miss Lonelyhearts tried to rape her.

   In the last scene, Mr. Doyle hides a gun inside a rolled newspaper and
   decides to take revenge on Miss Lonelyhearts. Lonelyhearts, who has
   just experienced a religious enlightenment after three days of
   sickness, runs toward Mr. Doyle to embrace him. The gun "explodes", and
   the two men roll down a flight of stairs together.
