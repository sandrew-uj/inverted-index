   The Third Doctor and UNIT are called in to investigate a murder at
   Project Inferno, an effort to drill through the Earth's crust to
   harness great energies within the planet's core. It transpires that the
   drilling is producing a green ooze that transforms all who touch it
   into savage humanoid creatures called Primords, who can only be killed
   via extreme cold. Unbeknownst to anyone, the project leader, Professor
   Stahlman has been infected and is in the early stages of the change.
   After quarrelling with Stahlman, the Doctor attempts an experiment on
   the detached TARDIS console, but a freak accident transports him into a
   parallel space-time continuum.

   In this new universe, where Great Britain is a totalitarian republic,
   the Doctor is captured and interrogated by Brigadier
   Lethbridge-Stewart's counterpart, a sadistic, eyepatch-wearing military
   commandant known as the Brigade Leader, along with the counterpart of
   the Doctor's companion Liz, who in this universe became a military
   officer instead of a scientist. When the drill penetrates the Earth's
   crust it unleashes immense amounts of heat and poisonous gases, along
   with more of the ooze, which Stahlman's counterpart uses to transform
   most of the remaining project staff into more Primords. The Doctor
   determines that the unleashed energies of the core will eventually
   disintegrate the planet, and is able to persuade the surviving staff
   members to help him return to his own dimension and prevent a similar
   catastrophe. They eventually succeed in restoring power to the TARDIS
   console despite repeated Primord attacks, but Liz's counterpart is
   forced to kill the Brigade Leader when he turns on the Doctor, who
   narrowly escapes as the Project Inferno facility is destroyed by a
   massive volcanic eruption.

   Back in his own reality, the Doctor urgently tries to have the drilling
   stopped, but like in the other reality his warnings are ignored. This
   time, however, the slower pace of the drilling means that Stahlman
   fully transforms into a Primord before the crust is penetrated instead
   of afterwards, and after the Doctor kills him with a fire extinguisher,
   the drilling is stopped in time to prevent disaster. Satisfied that the
   TARDIS console is now working again, the Doctor attempts to depart,
   only to end up landing in a local rubbish dump.
