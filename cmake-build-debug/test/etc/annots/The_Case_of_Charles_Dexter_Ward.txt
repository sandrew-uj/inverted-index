   The first installment of The Case of Charles Dexter Ward was promoted
   with an outsized banner headline on the cover of Weird Tales.
   The second installment received a less prominent headline.

   Charles Dexter Ward is a young man from a prominent Rhode Island family
   who has disappeared from a mental asylum. He had been incarcerated
   during a prolonged period of insanity, during which he exhibited minor
   and inexplicable physiological changes. His empty cell is found to be
   very dusty. The bulk of the story concerns the investigation conducted
   by the Wards' family doctor, Marinus Bicknell Willett, in an attempt to
   discover the reason for Ward's madness and physiological changes.
   Willett learns that Ward had spent the past several years attempting to
   discover the grave of his ill-reputed ancestor, Joseph Curwen.

   The doctor slowly begins to reveal the truth behind the legends
   surrounding Curwen, an eighteenth-century shipping entrepreneur and
   alleged alchemist, who was in reality a necromancer and mass murderer.
   A raid on Curwen's farm was remarkable for the shouted incantations,
   lights, explosions, and some not-quite-human figures shot down by the
   raiders. The raiders swore any witnesses to strict secrecy about what
   they saw and heard.

   As Willett's investigations proceed, he finds that Charles had
   recovered Curwen's ashes, and through the use of magical formulae
   contained in documents found hidden in Curwen's home in Providence, was
   able to call forth Curwen from his "essential saltes" and resurrect
   him. Willett also finds that Curwen, who resembles Charles enough to
   pass for him, murdered and replaced his modern descendant and resumed
   his evil activities. Although Curwen convinces onlookers that he is
   Charles, his anachronistic mindset and behavior lead authorities to
   certify him insane and imprison him in an asylum.

   While Curwen is locked up, Willett's investigation leads him to a
   bungalow in Pawtuxet Village, which Ward had purchased while under the
   influence of Curwen. The house is on the site of the old farm which was
   Curwen's headquarters for his nefarious doings; beneath is a vast
   catacomb that the wizard had built as a lair during his previous
   lifetime. During a horrific journey through this labyrinth, in which
   Willett sees a deformed monster in a pit, he discovers the truth about
   Curwen's crimes and also the means of returning him to the grave. It is
   also revealed that Curwen has been engaged in a long-term conspiracy
   with certain other necromancers, associates from his previous life who
   have somehow escaped death, to resurrect and torture the world's wisest
   people to gain knowledge that will make them powerful and threaten the
   future of mankind. While in Curwen's laboratory, Willett accidentally
   summons an ancient entity who is an enemy of Curwen and his fellow
   necromancers. The doctor faints, awakening much later in the bungalow.
   The entrance to the vaults has been sealed as if it had never existed,
   but Willett finds a note from the being written in Latin instructing
   him to kill Curwen and destroy his body.

   Willett confronts Curwen at the asylum and succeeds in reversing the
   resurrection spell, returning the sorcerer to dust. News reports reveal
   that Curwen's prime co-conspirators and their households have met
   brutal deaths, and their lairs have been destroyed.
