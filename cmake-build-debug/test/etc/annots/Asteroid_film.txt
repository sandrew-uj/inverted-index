   Late one night, near Billings, Montana, a gas tanker is driving by when
   a meteoroid suddenly hits in front of the truck. The driver attempts to
   swerve out of the way, but loses control and overturns and the tanker
   explodes, causing a massive fire.

   The next morning, the fire is burning out of control and it is reported
   that the tanker was hit by a lightning bolt. With the area evacuated,
   FEMA Director Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn), and a colleague, Adam
   Marquez (Carlos Gomez) are flying via helicopter over the area,
   inspecting the fire, when they notice that two people are still in the
   area. It's a man on the roof of his house, trying to save it, despite
   his wife's protests. Jack and Adam land and take the woman aboard. Her
   husband starts to suffer from smoke inhalation when Jack manages to get
   him aboard the helicopter. Jack just barely manages to escape as a
   propane tank causes a massive explosion and destroys the home.

   Later that evening, at the National Observatory in Boulder, Colorado,
   Dr. Lily McKee (Annabella Sciorra), the Observatory's director, is
   observing a comet which is going to pass by Earth on the 4th of July.
   Later on, when she goes home and looks at some photos, she sees what
   she believes are asteroids.

   The next day, she informs Jack and Adam of the possibility of an impact
   and calls them in. She tells them of two asteroids: Helios and Eros,
   whose orbits have been disrupted by the comet and may hit the Earth.
   Helios would hit with the force of 1,000 Hiroshima bombs and generate
   temperatures five times hotter than the Sun in the area of impact.
   Everything within a 150-mile radius would be destroyed and the impact
   would also spray molten rock another 70 miles.

   Eros is four miles across and would cause a global ecological disaster
   if it did indeed hit. Then, Max Jenson (Brian Hill), one of Lily's
   assistants, informs Lily, Jack and Adam that Helios is getting closer
   to the Earth and that the observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii had picked
   up some smaller asteroids that the National Observatory cannot see and
   they believe that a small one hit Montana. Jack and Adam realize that
   the fire was indeed caused by an asteroid impact.

   Later on, Lily and Max check Helios' trajectory and realize that it
   will indeed hit the Earth. Their numbers show that Helios will hit the
   Kansas City area within about 48 hours. They inform the President and
   he orders that the city be evacuated. Ultimately, a fragment of Helios
   strikes a dam in the Kansas City area, causing flooding in the city.
   Wallach, who drives into the city to rescue two stranded firefighters
   and a drunk driver who struck their vehicle, gets caught in the flood.
   He and the firefighters survive, but the drunk driver dies.

   Unfortunately, it is discovered Eros will hit also and will be an
   extinction-level event. The United States attempts to destroy Eros
   using lasers mounted on three jet fighter aircraft, but one of the
   lasers is damaged when the jet carrying it takes off and climbs to
   altitude through a violent storm. After making some last-minute
   adjustments, the lasers on the other two aircraft are used to seemingly
   destroy Eros. It is discovered that the mission was only partially
   successful. Instead of destroying the asteroid, the lasers broke it
   into many small yet deadly pieces.

   The largest piece and several smaller fragments of Eros hit Dallas,
   Texas, where Lily's son and father are. The city is devastated by the
   impacts. Lily desperately searches the city for her father and son, who
   survive the blast and aftershocks. Her father ends up trapped and hurt
   in the ruins of the hospital where he worked, while her son Elliot
   wanders off trying to find help. After a search, Lily locates her
   father and with the help of nearby firemen, rescues him, but goes on to
   try to rescue Elliot. After searching the ruined city, she finally
   locates Elliot in a large impact crater. Jack arrives to help in a
   helicopter. He rescues Elliot and the four return to base where they
   watch the comet pass by Earth, and are relieved it won't return to
   cause trouble for another 4,000 years.
