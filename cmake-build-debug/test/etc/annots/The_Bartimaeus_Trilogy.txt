   As the books in the trilogy progress, three story arcs become evident.
   The largest and overarching plot line is the rise and fall of London as
   a global hegemon. The second and third are more personal: the boy
   changing from the pitiful, yet noble, Nathaniel to the power-hungry,
   arrogant John Mandrake, and finally earning back his humility and
   nobility; and the third, involving Kitty and Bartimaeus, in which Kitty
   proves her faith to Bartimaeus by doing something only one non-demon
   (Ptolemy) had ever done when she goes to the Other Place. John Mandrake
   (Nathaniel) also shows unusual courage and loyalty when he dismisses
   Bartimaeus, as surely they were both going to die, thus eventually
   saving the life of a demon. They end up restoring each other's faith in
   their races.

   Each of the books is named for a magical artefact or spell: the Amulet
   of Samarkand, named after the city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, renders
   the wearer invulnerable to magical attacks; a Golem's Eye is an
   enchanted piece of clay in the form of an eye that when placed in the
   forehead of a Golem, enables one to control the golem; Ptolemy's Gate,
   named for a fictional member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, is a method that
   enables a human to enter the realm of spirits; and the Ring of Solomon,
   which invests the wearer with unshakable dominion over all spirits.
