   The plot is typically topsy-turvy. Whereas in the authors' earlier
   novel The Space Merchants the world was ruled by advertising agencies,
   in this novel corporate lawyers, especially the secretive firm of
   "Green, Charlesworth", have gained a stranglehold on the world.
   Business Law is an extremely lucrative career, while Criminal Law pays
   enough to afford some of the luxuries of life but not enough to save
   for the future.

   Success means living in a luxurious automated "bubble home" constructed
   by "GML", a corporation which is nominally public but whose shares are
   never traded openly. All work contracts include GML housing as part of
   the pay scale. Not having a contract job means having to live in a
   community such as "Belly Rave", originally a post-war suburban
   development for returning soldiers, now a slum ruled by gangs of
   teenagers and children. Its original name was "Belle Reve", which is
   French for "Beautiful Dream", in ironic contrast to the present ugly
   reality.

   For the common people, there are bread-and-circuses entertainments in
   the form of gladiatorial games of various kinds, with monetary rewards
   for the winners. Some games pit elderly people against each other armed
   with padded clubs, but others are more deadly.

   There are two main protagonists. One is Norvell Bligh, a nebbish
   designer of game spectacles for a second-rank corporation who is thrown
   out of his job and his GML home, a victim of office politics. His
   gold-digger wife, instead of leaving him, returns with him to her roots
   in the slum, kicking her daughter out to join a gang and bring in some
   money.

   The other is Charles Mundin, an attorney scratching out a living in
   criminal practice, barred from more lucrative commercial work by the
   licensing monopolies of the large law firms.

   By chance they encounter siblings Norma and Donald Lavin, who inherited
   25% of GML stock from their father, the inventor of the Bubble House.
   Donald placed the share certificates in a safe deposit box, and then
   was kidnapped and "conditioned", as are many common criminals. He can
   no longer tell anyone where the stock certificates are, and any attempt
   to obtain duplicate certificates from GML will surely result in more
   foul play.

   Helping the Lavins, they discover the truth behind GML and confront
   "Green, Charlesworth", whose true nature is more bizarre than anyone
   could imagine.
