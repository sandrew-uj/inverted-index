   The film flips back and forth between events that take place one year
   apart from each other.

   In the present, Robinson Laborde (Mathieu Amalric) lives in Biarritz in
   his parents' apartment. He has one hand and a prosthetic. One year
   before, while visiting his parents with his wife, Chloe (Karin Viard),
   and daughter Melanie (Manon Beaudoin), he sees a very attractive woman,
   Laetitia (Omahyra Mota), on the beach and falls hopelessly in love with
   her. He starts an affair and, as the film develops, it is evident that
   he has left his family to be with her.

   In the present, Robinson is looking for a notebook; the sales lady,
   Ombeline (Catherine Frot), tells him that paper has become scarce and
   all she can offer is a cooking book with blank spaces for notes. Later
   on, Ombeline happens to meet Robinson at a bar and starts small talk
   with him: she seems to know him but he does not remember.

   In the past, Laetitia has suddenly left Robinson; she is into
   pornography and prostitution although she denies having any sexual
   involvement with her "clients". There is news about a virus that is
   wiping everyone in the world but life goes on as usual. Robinson stops
   in a bar and finds his friend Theo (Sergi Lopez), a tenor. Theo tells
   him a story about the time he was a music teacher to the Marquise
   d'Arcangues (Sabine Azema), who had a baby by him, that included Iris
   (Clotilde Hesme), who is tending the bar. The Marquise told Theo that
   she had a dream that if he and Iris made love, they would save the
   world.

   In the present, Biarritz is suddenly evacuated; Robinson decides to go
   to Zaragoza, in Spain, to track Laetitia down. He stops in an abandoned
   boarding school and there is an earthquake. Robinson continues his trip
   and arrives in Pamplona, where everyone is celebrating the Sanfermines.
   He finds Ombeline and the two walk their way through town trying to
   find a place to stay, to no avail. Ombeline tells Robertson that her
   husband has left her to search for another woman in Spain. He starts
   telling her his story, which he has been writing in the cooking book
   she sold him. Suddenly, there are terrorist attacks in Pamplona and the
   two leave for a hotel in the mountains; Ombeline manages to secure a
   suite that is usually reserved for the Royal Family. While Robinson and
   Ombeline make love, helicopters are seen through the windows. Later
   that night, while having dinner, Ombeline sees her husband with the
   other woman, Iris. Since Robertson will do nothing, she calls him a
   coward and he leaves. While leaving the hotel, he receives a video from
   his daughter who is doing well off in a ship. As he records an answer,
   Ombeline has stolen her husband's car and they finally reach Zaragoza.
   Ombeline reveals that she was his father's lover, but they suddenly
   stopped their relationship.

   In the past, Robinson and Laetitia are living together and travel to
   Taiwan. He is trying to have a nice traditional vacation but she
   manages to ruin everything. She disappears once again and he is forced
   to go back to France because his parents have gone missing. Laetitia
   suddenly reappears in Canada, he meets her there, and, as they are
   enjoying the snow, a couple of gangsters appear and take Laetitia back;
   they leave Robinson to find his way back to civilization. Due to
   frostbite, he loses his right hand.

   In the present, Robinson tracks Laetitia's mother (Baya Belal) down but
   she has no idea where her daughter is. The alarms go off and all are
   evacuated. Robinson and Ombeline arrive by train in Toulouse, the new
   capital city of France. There, he meets with his wife again who asks
   him to join her at her hotel, which is the new government headquarters.
   Robinson and his ex-wife make love but are interrupted by a call and
   new alarms. In the TV monitors, news is seen that the world is sinking
   into chaos. Robinson abandons Ombeline and decides to go to the theatre
   where Theo shall be singing; as the opera goes, Ombeline finds
   Robinson, she is furious because he had left her, but is forced to sit
   and watch the opera. She wonders about men and is tired of their
   infidelity. She reaches into her purse and takes out Robinson's
   father's lamp-knife and cuts her throat. The opera is interrupted but,
   also, the sound of a bomb going off evacuates the theatre. Robinson
   wanders the streets and finds his wife who offers to take him in a
   military airplane to a safe place, because nuclear missiles shall be
   launched upon France, but he decides to stay to find Laetitia. She then
   decides to stay and, as she goes off to tell her party to leave, a
   terrorist attacks the van killing all; Robinson is injured by the
   debris. The next morning, all streets are deserted. Robinson stumbles
   back to the hotel and finds Theo there. They talk and Theo confesses
   that Robinson has been the love of his life. They kiss but Robinson
   suddenly stops. He opens the windows as Theo showers, but as he comes
   out of the bathroom, he jumps off the balcony and dies.

   Robinson leaves the hotel with Iris, who had spent the night with Theo
   - her father. She tells him of a castle where there is a fall-out
   shelter and she knows the code to enter, they stop to eat in a country
   hotel where all the guests are dead. Iris dies too, it is unclear if
   because of the virus or due to overdose.

   Robinson reaches the castle and enters with the code, he finds a
   decadent party going on where all the guests are enjoying their last
   moments on earth before going into the shelter. They are watching porn
   and having sex, while drinking blue martinis. Robinson breaks the news
   of Iris' death to the Marquise, who lays down in bed with a crucifix on
   her chest. Robinson spots a screen where he sees Laetitia and realises
   that she is still alive. As he tries to track her down on the internet,
   he is knocked off by an old man. The next day, all is quiet. As he
   wanders through the castle, he finds all the guests dead in the main
   salon; the servants poisoned the martinis to take over the shelter.
   Robinson leaves.

   A couple of days later, he arrives in Paris and he walks through the
   deserted streets. He goes to an apartment and finally meets with
   Laetitia, who has been waiting for him. A bomb goes off and Robinson
   dreams of him and Laetitia walking naked through the living streets of
   Paris. They reach a building where they hide and kiss. A second and
   fatal bomb explodes.
