   Mine inspector Ralph Burton (Harry Belafonte) becomes trapped in a
   cave-in in a mine in Pennsylvania. He can hear rescuers digging towards
   him, but after a few days they slow down and then stop completely.
   Alarmed, he digs his own way out. Reaching the surface, he finds a
   deserted world. (No bodies are seen at any time in the film.) Discarded
   newspapers provide an explanation: one proclaims "UN Retaliates For Use
   Of Atomic Poison", another that "Millions Flee From Cities! End Of The
   World". Ralph later plays tapes at a radio station that reveal that an
   unknown nation had used radioactive sodium isotopes as a weapon,
   producing a dust cloud that spread around the world and was completely
   lethal for a five-day period.

   Travelling to New York City in search of other survivors, he finds the
   city vacant. Ralph busies himself restoring power to a building where
   he takes up residence. Just as the loneliness starts to become
   intolerable, he encounters a second survivor: Sarah Crandall (Inger
   Stevens), a white woman in her twenties. The two become fast friends,
   but Ralph grows distant when it becomes clear that Sarah is developing
   stronger feelings for him. Despite living in a post-apocalyptic world,
   Ralph cannot overcome the inhibitions instilled in him in a racist
   American society.

   Ralph regularly broadcasts on the radio, hoping to contact other
   people. Eventually, he receives a signal in French, indicating there
   are at least a few other survivors. Then ill white man Benson Thacker
   (Mel Ferrer) arrives by boat. Ralph and Sarah nurse him back to health,
   but once he recovers, Ben sets his sights on Sarah and sees Ralph as a
   rival. Ralph is torn by conflicting emotions. He avoids Sarah as much
   as possible, to give Ben every opportunity to win her affections, but
   cannot quite bring himself to leave the city.

   Ben finally grows tired of the whole situation, realizing he stands
   little chance with Sarah as long as Ralph remains nearby. He warns
   Ralph that the next time he sees him, he will try to kill him. The two
   armed men hunt each other through the empty streets. Finally, Ralph
   passes by the United Nations headquarters, climbs the steps in Ralph
   Bunche Park, and reads the inscription "They shall beat their swords
   into plowshares. And their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not
   lift up sword against nation. Neither shall they learn war any more",
   from the Book of Isaiah. He throws down his rifle and goes unarmed to
   confront Ben, who in turn finds himself unable to shoot his foe.
   Defeated, he starts walking away. Sarah appears. When Ralph starts to
   turn away from her, she makes him take her hand; then she calls to Ben
   and gives him her other hand. Together, the three walk down the street
   to build a new future together. The film ends not with "The End", but
   with "The Beginning".
