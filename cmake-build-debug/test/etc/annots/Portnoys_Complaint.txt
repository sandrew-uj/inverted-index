   Structurally, Portnoy's Complaint is a continuous monologue by narrator
   Alexander Portnoy to his psychoanalyst, Dr. Spielvogel; Roth later
   explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a
   psychoanalytic session was motivated by "the permissive conventions of
   the patient-analyst situation," which would "permit me to bring into my
   fiction the sort of intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive
   language that  in another fictional environment would have struck
   me as pornographic, exhibitionistic, and nothing but obscene."

   The novel is set primarily in New Jersey from the 1940s to the 1960s.
   Portnoy is "a lust-ridden, mother-addicted young Jewish bachelor",
   and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage
   of his life; every recollection in some way touches upon his central
   dilemma: his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures
   even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever
   more creative (and, in his mind, degrading and shameful) acts of
   eroticism; also, much of his dilemma is that "his
   sense of himself, his past, and his ridiculous destiny is so
   fixed." Roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of
   his book. On the first page of the novel, one finds this clinical
   definition of "Portnoy's Complaint", as if taken from a manual on
   sexual dysfunction:

     Portnoy's Complaint: A disorder in which strongly felt ethical and
     altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual
     longings, often of a perverse nature ...

   The title also alludes to the common literary form of complaint, such
   as "A Lover's Complaint", which typically presents the speaker's
   comments on being a spurned lover.

   Other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation
   experiences of American Jews, their relationship to the Jews of Israel,
   and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the
   son of a Jewish family.

   Portnoy's Complaint is also emblematic of the times during which it was
   published. Most obviously, the book's sexual frankness was both a
   product of and a reflection on the sexual revolution that was in full
   swing during the late 1960s. And the book's narrative style, a huge
   departure from the stately, semi-Jamesian prose of Roth's earlier
   novels, has often been likened to the stand-up performances of 1960s
   comedian Lenny Bruce.

   The novel is notable for its explicit and candid treatment of
   sexuality, including detailed depictions of masturbation using various
   props including a piece of liver which Portnoy's mother later
   serves for dinner.
