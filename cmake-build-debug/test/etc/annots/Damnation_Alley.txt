   The story opens in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, in a hellish
   world shattered by nuclear war decades before. Several police states
   have emerged in place of the former United States. Hurricane-force
   winds above five hundred feet prevent any sort of air travel from one
   state to the next, and sudden, violent, and unpredictable "garbage
   storms" and giant, mutated animals and insects make day-to-day life a
   mini-hell. Hell Tanner, an imprisoned killer, is offered a full pardon
   in exchange for taking on a suicide mission--a drive through "Damnation
   Alley" across a ruined America from Los Angeles to Boston--as one of
   three Landmaster vehicles attempting to deliver an urgently needed
   plague vaccine.
