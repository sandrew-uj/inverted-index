   Before writing Pattern Recognition, the author, William Gibson,
   published seven novels (one co-written) and numerous short stories
   beginning in 1977. His previous novel, All Tomorrow's Parties, was
   published in October 1999 as the conclusion of the Bridge trilogy.
   Pattern Recognition was written between 2001 and 2002 while Gibson was
   living in Vancouver, British Columbia and released in February
   2003. Pattern Recognition was originally intended to be a stand-alone
   novel, but afterwards Gibson wrote Spook Country and Zero History
   which take place in the same universe and use some of the same
   characters.

   Gibson traveled to Tokyo in 2001 to prepare for this new novel, which
   takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to
   London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet
   resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about
   100 pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after
   watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and "realized
    had become a story that took place in an alternate time
   track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened". He considered abandoning
   the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as
   a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a
   2003 interview he said, "There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no
   idea what the summer of 2002 was going to be like. ... In the original
   post-9/11 draft, London felt more like London is feeling right now.
   Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers. But I took that out,
   because as it got closer to the time, it wasn't actually
   happening."
