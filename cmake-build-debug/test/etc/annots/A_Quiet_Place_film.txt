   After 89 days, most of Earth's human population has been annihilated by
   blind creatures with hypersensitive hearing that attack anything making
   any type of sound. The alien creatures are covered in armor-like skin
   that is impervious to bullets and explosives.

   The Abbott family - wife Evelyn, husband Lee, deaf teenage daughter
   Regan, and younger sons Marcus and Beau - silently scavenge for
   supplies in a deserted town. Going barefoot while outdoors, the family
   communicates in American Sign Language. Inside a store, four-year-old
   Beau is drawn to a battery-powered space shuttle toy, but Lee takes it
   away due to the noise it would make. Regan returns the toy to Beau, who
   also takes the batteries that his father removed from it. Beau
   activates the toy when the family is crossing a bridge, alerting a
   nearby creature, which kills him.

   Over a year later, Regan struggles with guilt over her brother's death,
   Evelyn enters the final stages of pregnancy, and Lee tries to make
   radio contact with the outside world. Lee attempts to upgrade Regan's
   cochlear implant with scavenged miniature amplifiers to restore her
   hearing, but the devices are ineffective. Later, Lee takes Marcus to a
   nearby river with a large waterfall to teach him to fish, while Regan
   sneaks off to visit Beau's memorial. Lee tells Marcus it is safe to
   talk when louder background noise masks their voices from the
   creatures. Marcus says that Regan blames herself for Beau's death and
   needs her father to tell her he still loves her.

   Alone at the house, Evelyn goes into labor. While making her way to
   their basement, she accidentally steps on an exposed nail with her bare
   foot and drops a glass picture frame, alerting a nearby creature.
   Evelyn flips a switch that changes the exterior house lights to red as
   a signal to the others and struggles to remain silent during her
   contractions. Arriving at the farm and seeing the lights, Lee instructs
   Marcus to set off fireworks as a diversion. Lee finds Evelyn hiding in
   the bathroom with their newborn son. They make their way to the
   improvised soundproofed basement. Lee leaves to find the other
   children. Evelyn falls asleep but awakens to discover the basement is
   flooded from a broken water pipe and that a creature is inside with
   her.

   Regan and Marcus take refuge atop a grain silo and light a fire to
   signal their father. However, they run out of lighter fluid and the
   fire dies before attracting Lee's attention. A hatch door suddenly
   gives way, and Marcus falls into the silo. The falling door distracts
   the creature that was stalking Evelyn and it instead targets Marcus and
   Regan. Regan, who jumped in after Marcus, sinks into the corn and
   nearly suffocates, but Marcus saves her. Regan's cochlear implant
   reacts to the proximity of the creature by emitting a high-frequency
   sound that repels it. The children escape the silo and find their
   father.

   The creature returns, attacking and wounding Lee, while Marcus and
   Regan hide in a pickup truck. Marcus shouts, attracting the creature
   away from his father to the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he loves her
   and always has, before yelling to draw the creature to him. The
   creature then attacks and kills Lee. Regan and Marcus roll the truck
   down a hill to escape and reunite with Evelyn and the baby at the
   farmhouse. The four retreat to the basement. When the creature returns,
   Regan, who realizes that the sound made by the implant distresses the
   creature, switches the device back on and places it on a nearby
   microphone, amplifying the feedback. Painfully disoriented, the
   creature exposes the flesh beneath its armored head, allowing Evelyn to
   fatally shoot it with a shotgun. The family views a CCTV monitor,
   showing two creatures attracted by the noise of the shotgun blast
   approaching the house. With their newly acquired knowledge of the
   creatures' weakness, Evelyn reloads.
