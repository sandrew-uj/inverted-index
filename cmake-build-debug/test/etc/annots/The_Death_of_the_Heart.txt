   At the beginning of the novel, Portia moves in with Anna and Thomas
   Quayne after her mother dies. Portia is Thomas's half sister. Mr.
   Quayne (Thomas's father) had an extramarital affair with Irene
   (Portia's mother) while married to Thomas's mother. When Irene became
   pregnant, and Mrs. Quayne learned of it, she was adamant that he do
   what was the right thing: so, at his own wife's unyielding insistence,
   Mr. Quayne divorced Thomas's mother and married Irene. Mr. Quayne,
   Irene, and Portia then left England and traveled through Europe as
   exiles from society and from the Quayne family, living in the cheapest
   of lodgings. Irene and Portia continued to live in this fashion until,
   when Portia was 16, Irene died. Portia was sent to live with Thomas and
   Anna after Irene's death. The plan is that she is to stay with them for
   one year at which time Portia will leave and move in with Irene's
   sister (Portia's aunt).

   Portia is a naturally awkward girl, and this aspect of her personality
   has been intensified by her strange childhood which was one of constant
   travel, change, and strangers, while at the same time being incredibly
   isolating. She is uniquely innocent in her observations of people, and
   is baffled by inconsistencies between what they say and what they do,
   and wonders why people say things they do not mean. She keeps a diary
   detailing the lives of those around her, particularly Anna, trying to
   understand the key to people she thinks she is missing. Anna finds and
   reads Portia's diary; she is incensed by the idea of the girl observing
   her every move, and rages about the girl to her friend St. Quentin, a
   writer and frequent visitor to the Quaynes's home. It becomes clear
   over the course of the novel that Anna dislikes Portia because she is
   strange. Anna and Thomas are generally uncomfortable with Portia in
   their home but try to make do. They send her to classes where she makes
   friends with a girl named Lilian.

   Portia's love interest, if she can be said to have one, is a man named
   Eddie. Eddie works at Thomas's advertising agency. He also has a
   flirtatious relationship with Anna prior to Portia's arrival. Eddie
   does not truly love Portia.

   Partway through the novel, Anna and Thomas go on vacation to Italy and
   send Portia to live with Anna's former governess, Mrs. Heccomb, for the
   duration of the trip.

   The climax of the novel occurs when St. Quentin, a friend of Anna's,
   tells Portia that Anna has been reading her diary. As a result of this
   Portia runs away. She first goes to Eddie who becomes overwhelmed by
   her and sends her away telling her that he is Anna's lover (which is
   not true). Portia then takes refuge with an acquaintance of Anna's
   named Major Brutt. Portia goes to Major Brutt's hotel and begs him to
   run away with her and to marry her. Major Brutt then calls Thomas and
   Anna to tell them where Portia is. The novel ends with Thomas and Anna
   sending their maid, Matchett, to Major Brutt's hotel in order to fetch
   Portia.
