   The story is told by a spirit to a young man who comes upon its cave
   while traveling in Syria. The protagonist, Omegarus, is the son of the
   King of Europe and the last child born there in a far future in which
   the earth is becoming sterile and the human ability to reproduce is
   fading. He sees a vision of Syderia, the last fertile woman. She lives
   in Brazil, so he travels there in an airship. After various adventures
   there, including meeting Ormus, the Spirit of Earth, who urges the two
   to begin a rebirth of the human race, Omegarus returns to Europe with
   Syderia by his side. There they meet Adam, the first man, who has been
   condemned by God to watch all the damned among his descendants enter
   Hell, and who is now charged with persuading Omegarus and Syderia not
   to prolong the life of humanity, which God has determined must now end.
   He succeeds in having Omegarus leave Syderia, who then dies. Ormus, who
   cannot survive without humanity, despairs, and the world begins to end
   and the graves of all the dead to open, initiating the eventual Rapture
   and the events described in the Book of Revelation.
