   For ten years the Terran Confederation has been at war with a reptilian
   species, called the Saurians, who are controlled by the unknown
   Masters. It's been a losing war for the Terrans and their allies and
   now the Scandian system is under attack. Geoffrey (Jeff) Knowland, a
   junior officer of Star Watch must lead a fighting evacuation of the
   planet Northolm. He succeeds, but the Frontier Coordinator, Heath
   Knowland, his father, reprimands him for losing men in a diversionary
   raid.

   Needing a rest, Jeff goes to Earth to present his father's plan for
   defending the Confederation to the ruling Council. The war isn't going
   well and the prospects don't look good: the Masters' empire extends
   across most of the galaxy while the Terran Confederation spans only 200
   light years.

   While the Council debates the plan that Jeff has presented, the
   Saurians attack the main Star Watch fleet and defeat it, killing Jeff's
   father. Shocked, the Council agrees to the Knowland Plan and also to an
   attack by a Terran Expeditionary Force into enemy space to knock the
   Saurians off balance. Heading out to Orion, the force defeats several
   Saurian fleets, destroying enemy ships faster than they lose their own.
   They conquer a vast volume of space and then seek to make allies of the
   subjugated people whom they find.

   After a period of rest, repair, and reinforcement, the Expeditionary
   Force sets out again, fighting its way across thousands of light years.
   It then encounters a giant force controlled by the Masters. A quick and
   daring attack forces the Masters to flee and the human fleet scatters
   its attackers. In the wreckage of an enemy ship the humans find an
   intact set of star charts and use them to locate the Masters' home
   worlds.

   Using a new astrogation system, the fleet proceeds directly to the
   Masters' star cluster. The Saurians there are completely unprepared and
   are easily defeated. Jeff then confronts one of the Masters on the
   Masters' ancient home world. The Master tells Jeff that having won the
   war, he is now responsible for an empire comprising eighty billion star
   systems, and then the Master vanishes.
