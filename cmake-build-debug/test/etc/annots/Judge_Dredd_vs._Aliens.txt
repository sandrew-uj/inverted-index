   A shoot out in a traffic jam, an all too common occurrence in the
   teeming and turbulent Mega-City One, inevitably draws the attention of
   the judges. Carlos Lenning a.k.a. Jeremiah, the anti-judicial activist,
   is in hot pursuit of Jimson James "Jimmy" Godber, a small-time crook,
   headed for Eisenhower Hospital. But Godber only arrives inside in time
   for a chestburster to erupt from his chest. Judge Dredd gets on the
   case and summons the Verminator team in order to follow up the various
   leads on the criminal associates of the late Godber.

   The Verminators seal off the hospital and begin their search.
   Meanwhile, the judges learn that Godber had planned to exploit the
   Aliens for illegal pit fighting and wagering, leading them in turn to
   Godber's warehouse hideout and a deadly clutch of Alien eggs. They also
   find Godber's dead neighbor, murdered in revenge for noise pollution,
   and the dead husks of face huggers. Suddenly Judge Brubaker is ambushed
   by a live facehugger suddenly hatching from an egg. Leaping to his
   defense, the Verminators discover that Aliens bleed deadly acid. The
   Judges have underestimated the danger and are losing control, as the
   Alien attacks.

   As the body count rises steeply, the judges rush back to the hospital
   where things are just as bad. Evacuating the hospital they eventually
   eliminate a second alien, but then reassessing the trace evidence leads
   to the conclusion that there may already be many more Aliens on the
   loose. Jeremiah's driver, Futsie, is still at large. Futsie has
   descended into the Undercity where he meets with Mr Bones, the
   architect of the entire evil plan.

   Walking with Futsie ever deeper into his lair, Bones outlines his plan
   for the 'Incubus' as he calls the Aliens. Bones discovered them during
   his days as a space pirate and brought some back to serve his scheme
   for revenge upon Mega-City One. It rapidly becomes clear that there is
   already a vast hive beneath the city ready to be unleashed.

   Throwing Futsie to the monsters, Bones prepares the final stages of his
   dastardly plan. The Alien hive has been cultivated directly beneath the
   Grand Hall of Justice and Bones deploys a shaped charge to blow an
   entry for hordes of killer aliens into the Grand Hall. Things look grim
   for the judges, even backed by assault squads and the Verminators.
   Judge Giant, with the command codes, is able to fight his way to the
   sub-armory to activate the four Mechanismo robo-judges, finally turning
   the tide and repelling the Aliens back underground.

   But in the struggle, the raw recruit Judge Sanchez is taken by the
   enemy, and Dredd goes in alone to bring her back. They both become
   infected in the rescue. Dredd and Sanchez must find the way to destroy
   the Aliens and save themselves. Bones wears a special device to prevent
   the Aliens from turning upon him. As they escape, Dredd and Sanchez
   destroy Bones device, leaving Bones to be torn apart by the Aliens.
   Then upon discovery of the Alien Queen, the source of all the eggs,
   Dredd and Sanchez open fire upon a nearby geothermal heating tower to
   Mega-City One above, in hopes of releasing the magma to destroy her.
   But the geothermal heating tower proves too solidly constructed until
   Packer, leader of the Verminators, soaring in to the fray, fires upon
   the geothermal heating tower with her own heavier weaponry. The ensuing
   magma flow finally wipes out the deadly Alien hordes. Dredd and Sanchez
   escape and doctors remove the chestbursters just in time before they
   can erupt. The doctors are eager to study the extracted Alien
   chestbursters, but thinking better of that idea, Judge Dredd summarily
   executes the deadly creatures. "I'm just not the motherly type" quips
   Dredd, sardonically.
