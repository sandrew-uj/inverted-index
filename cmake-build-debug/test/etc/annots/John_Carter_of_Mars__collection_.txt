   John Carter of Mars is the eleventh and final book in the Barsoom
   series by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is not a novel, but
   rather a collection of two John Carter of Mars stories.

   The first story was originally published in 1940 by Whitman as a Better
   Little Book entitled John Carter of Mars. Although credited to Edgar
   Rice Burroughs, it was written (and illustrated) by his son, John
   Coleman Burroughs^[1] and was later expanded and re-published in the
   January issue of Amazing Stories in 1941 as "John Carter and the Giant
   of Mars", the name it goes under in the collection.^[2]

   The second story, "Skeleton Men of Jupiter", was first published in
   Amazing Stories in 1943. Intended as the first in a series of
   novelettes to be later collected in book form, in the fashion of Llana
   of Gathol, it ends with the plot unresolved, and the intended sequels
   were never written. Several other writers have written pastiche endings
   for the story.^[citation needed]

   The first edition of John Carter of Mars (a title that Burroughs never
   used for any book in the Barsoom series) was published in 1964 by
   Canaveral Press, fourteen years after his death.
