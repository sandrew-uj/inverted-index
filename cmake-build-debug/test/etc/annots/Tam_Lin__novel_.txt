   The protagonist of Tam Lin is Janet Carter. Written in the indirect
   third person, from Carter's point of view, the novel is set during her
   years as a student in the early 1970s at the fictional Blackstock
   College in Minnesota. The characters include her fellow students,
   professors at the college, her family, and a childhood friend. The plot
   combines the story of a young woman's life at college with a retelling
   of the traditional Scottish fairy ballad "Tam Lin".
