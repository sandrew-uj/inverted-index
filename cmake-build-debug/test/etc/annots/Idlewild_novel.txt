   A young man wakes up with no memory of who he is, where he is, or
   anything about his life and is initially unable to move.

   After a short period of time, he regains motion, but no memories. Over
   the next few pages, he is faced with flashing lights, disembodied
   voices, a cathedral, teddy bears nailed to wooden posts, graveyards,
   the realization that he is both alone and that his world is impossibly
   small, and terrifying creatures known as Nightgaunts, before meeting
   with Jasmine, a 'human' who identifies him as Halloween.

   As the book progresses, Halloween realizes where he is. He's in a
   virtual reality school that his parents have sent him to. Upon
   completion of the school, each student will receive both a scholarship
   to go through college and a position in a prestigious medical company
   called Gedaechtnis Corporation (in German, Gedaechtnis means memory, or
   ability to recall). The ten students are Mercutio (Adam), Pandora
   (Naomi), Simone, Isaac, Lazarus, Vashti, Tyler, Champagne (Charlotte),
   Fantasia (Gina), and Halloween (Gabriel) himself. Fan, Merc, Hal, and
   Ty are considered the "clods" while Simone, Isaac, Laz, Vashti, Cham,
   and Pan are the "pets". Where pets study and follow all of the rules,
   clods do the opposite. The digital teacher of the school is named
   Maestro, but the clods call him Mae$tro (pronounced 'Maeshtro') and do
   not respect or care for him. Each student is given a digital world that
   they may edit to their liking; this is where they 'live' while in IVR
   and where Halloween first finds himself at the beginning of the book.
   They are also assigned a "Nanny," a digital being that can help a
   student with anything they need help with. For example, when Halloween
   realizes that Jasmine is not real, he asks Nanny to bring her back to
   life (she died in a fight against Fantasia), and Nanny does so. Because
   of Halloween's suspicions that he may have killed Lazarus, he does not
   confide in anyone for a long period of time.

   Mercutio asks Halloween if he'd like some food, and they decide to dine
   at the Taj Mahal. Mercutio begins to order a steak, but halfway through
   his order, the entire world freezes up. Merc has triggered a jammer so
   that he and Hal can escape IVR, and they both wake up in their beds in
   the school. They decided to visit their favorite diner, Twain's, and
   enjoy a nice meal before Merc decides to head back to IVR. Halloween,
   however, chooses to call his parents and report that he is dropping
   out. After a tough time with both his parents and Ellison, the school's
   headmaster (and the man Maestro was modeled after), Halloween is sent
   back to IVR.

   Halloween "graduates" all of the remaining students, waking them up
   from IVR. They decide to fulfill Gedaechtnis' plans for them to rebuild
   the world, but Halloween rejects the plan. The book ends with Halloween
   standing in the woods of Michigan, angry at the world for robbing him
   of his illusions, the girl he loved and his two best friends.
