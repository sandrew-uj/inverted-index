   The Imperial prison barge Purge breaks down in a distant, uninhabited
   part of space. Its only hope appears to lie with the Star Destroyer
   Vector, drifting nearby, derelict and seemingly abandoned. When a
   boarding party from the Purge is sent to scavenge for parts, only half
   of them come back, bringing with them a contagion so lethal that within
   hours, almost all aboard the Purge are dead - the half-dozen survivors
   include two teenage brothers, Kale and Trig Longo, the ruthless captain
   of the guards, Jareth Sartoris, and chief medical officer, Zahara Cody,
   all of whom seem to possess natural immunity.

   The Purge's onboard computer informs Cody that there are also two
   survivors in isolation, and Cody leaves the medibay to release them and
   administer an antidote synthesized from her blood by the incumbent 21B
   medical droid "Waste". The isolated prisoners are Han Solo and
   Chewbacca who initially are skeptical of the situation, but allow her
   to immunize them, and make their way back to medical. Upon returning to
   medical they find it empty, and Waste destroyed. The dead have become
   undead and begin to hunt the survivors who are forced to abandon Purge
   and take shelter in the Vector, unaware that the Destroyer is not the
   better place to be.

   All the survivors are separated: Sartoris faces the few living
   survivors who have become cannibalistic, and are hiding in an Imperial
   Assault shuttle previously captured by the Vector tractor beam. Solo
   and Chewbacca make their way to the bridge in an attempt to either fly
   the Vector, or at least turn off the tractor beam. Kale dies from an
   infected wound, returns to life as a zombie, and is subsequently killed
   again by Trig. Cody finds herself in the Vector medbay, and with the
   aid of the Destroyer's own 21B discovers the cause of the contagion:
   Codenamed Blackwing, it is an artificially created virus - intended to
   slow the onset of decay and rigor mortis, and increase the healing
   capacity of the human body prior to death. The Vector was taking it to
   an isolated outpost for testing. However, the contagion - characterised
   by a grey goo - leaked from its containers and infected the ship,
   converting its 8,000 crew into the undead. Cody observes from her
   vantage point that the remaining ships in the docking bay are being
   filled with the zombies, who are attempting to leave the Vector and
   spread their contagion throughout the galaxy.

   After escaping from the shuttle, Sartoris meets up with Solo, Chewbacca
   and Trig, then sacrifices himself to allow them to escape, after
   revealing he has been bitten by an undead and is himself turning into a
   zombie. They return to the shuttle and successfully leave the Vector,
   but discover that a zombie has made it aboard the shuttle and killed
   the two remaining original survivors. The zombie is shot by Cody - who
   they had previously thought killed when the shuttle ready room she was
   hiding in was destroyed by the zombies - and she points out that the
   rest of the escaped ships are no longer controlled, as they watch two
   infested TIE fighters collide with each other and explode. Cody
   theorises that Blackwing is only effective when in range of the
   original contagion source on the Destroyer, and that now removed from
   the source the zombies have again "died".

   The four survivors leave the Vector and the now-derelict ships, and
   find a planet where they sell the shuttle to a pirate group. Solo and
   Chewbacca leave to re-buy their impounded ship, while Cody and Trig use
   their share of the sale to visit a distant planet - home to one of the
   dead prison guards, and deliver a note he was in the process of writing
   when Blackwing took him.
