   The book focuses on Lilly and her path to Woodbury, Georgia, a rural
   town that is barricaded and walled off to separate the living from the
   undead. It seems to be the perfect sanctuary. Life appears idyllic,
   with plenty of food, shelter and security provided to its residents.
   The town expands and grows stronger every day, and its leader, The
   Governor (Philip Blake), keeps the citizens in line.

   Lilly begins to suspect all is not as it seems. Blake, who relishes his
   title as The Governor, has disturbing ideas about law and order. Lilly
   and a group of rebels band together to fight The Governor. Mayhem and
   destruction result when they challenge his reign.
