   Rockabilly singer Byron Harley survives a mountain top plane crash and
   finds himself stuck in fairy time in Tufa territory. Sixty years go by
   after he spends only one night in the mountains. Bo-Kate Wisby and
   Jefferson Powell are young lovers banished from Cloud County by the
   Tufa for murder; a curse prevents them from returning home and strips
   them of their magical abilities. All three hate the Tufa for ruining
   their lives. The curse persists for fifty years, but then starts to
   weaken and Bo-Kate finds a way to circumvent it and recruits Byron to
   enact her revenge on the Tufa.
