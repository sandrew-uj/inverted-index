   A bruised and bloodied woman wakes chained to a wall, unable to
   remember her name or how she arrived in her situation. Her captor, a
   crazed woman named Molly Southbourne, tells her a story. Molly was
   raised in a secluded farm. Every time she bleeds, another molly
   appears. (The blood of other mollies, however, does not create more
   mollies). At first the mollies appear friendly, but in three days or
   less they will "turn bad" and try to murder her.

   At college, Molly begins a short-lived relationship with a man named
   Leon. Molly's parents are killed by a molly. She drops out of college
   and is hired as a research assistant by anatomy professor James Down,
   whom she eventually dates. Molly finds a letter from her mother. As a
   government spy, her mother was ordered to steal the biomedical research
   of a professor investigating declining female fertility. She injected
   herself with an experimental fluid, leading to Molly's condition. James
   discovers that Leon was killed by his own molly, a slow-growing clone
   that eventually ruptured and killed him. James has been infected and
   will soon die as well. Molly builds a dungeon in her basement.

   Molly reveals that the woman chained to the wall is the eleventh molly
   to appear since the construction of the dungeon, and the first which
   has not gone insane. Molly commits suicide and allows the new molly to
   take her place.
