   The game's story continues 3 years after the events of The Legend of
   Spyro: The Eternal Night. Spyro and Cynder, who are now teenagers, are
   broken free of their crystalline prison by mysterious enemies known as
   Grublins. The two are tethered together with mysterious green energy
   chains created by the Dark Master before being carried away while Sparx
   is found by Hunter of Avalar, who was watching them from the shadows.
   Meanwhile, Spyro and Cynder find themselves in a dark, volcano-like
   area. When they try to leave, they find out that they can't as they are
   chained to the platform they awoke on. After defeating several waves of
   Grublins and avoiding an earth Golem that attacks them soon after,
   Spyro and Cynder manage to escape the Catacombs with the help of
   Hunter, who is with Sparx. After reaching safety in Twilight Falls,
   Hunter reveals to Spyro, Cynder and Sparx that the Dark Master,
   Malefor, had returned to the realm shortly after the events of The
   Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night and has covered the land in darkness
   ever since.
   Malefor, the game's antagonist.

   Once they reach the Dragon City of Warfang, Spyro, Cynder and Hunter
   are separated as the city is under siege by Malefor's forces. After a
   long and fierce battle that ends in the siege driven back, the Golem
   returns and uses parts of the city to create an arm to replace the one
   it lost in the Catacombs. Spyro and Cynder defeat the Golem by
   destroying the Dark Crystal in its head, allowing Spyro, Cynder and the
   Dragon Guardians to finally reunite. The victory is short lived, as
   later that night, Malefor sends the citizens of Warfang a message; he
   has revived the Destroyer, an ancient creature whose purpose is to
   renew the world by bringing about its destruction, as they will be
   unable to catch up with the creature if they fly after it, the Fire
   Dragon Guardian Ignitus (the leader of the Dragon Guardians) hatches
   the plan that waiting for it to circle back. Underground is the only
   way to intercept it in time. Cynder and Spyro are able to open the
   gates to the underground Ruins of Warfang, which leads the attack
   forces to the canyon where the Destroyer will complete the Ring of
   Annihilation, by destroying a nearby dam. They stall the Destroyer long
   enough to destroy its Dark Crystal heart, but it was an effort spent in
   vain. The Destroyer manages to complete the Belt of Fire and Ignitus
   orders everyone underground as he escorts Spyro and Cynder to the Belt
   of Fire. In order to get them to the Burned Lands, which will lead them
   to Malefor's lair, Ignitus sacrifices himself in the crossing. Spyro,
   overcome with grief; turns into his dark form and tries to go back and
   save him (which also threatened to harm Cynder with levitating rocks)
   but is stopped and comforted by Cynder.

   After getting through the Burned Lands and the Floating Islands, Spyro
   and Cynder arrive at Malefor's lair and confront him. Malefor taunts
   Spyro by telling him that the destiny of all purple dragons is to bring
   about the world's destruction, to which Spyro denies. During the
   confrontation, the evil dragon gets rid of the green chain that
   tethered Spyro and Cynder together throughout their trials, then
   corrupts Cynder back to his cause, Cynder attacks Spyro, only to break
   free from Malefor's control when Spyro refused to fight and stated that
   he has left Cynder nothing to fight for. Angered by this turn of
   events, Malefor binds Spyro and Cynder together once again to kill them
   both before beginning their battle airborne. As Spyro and Cynder fly
   after Malefor, the Destroyer completes its circle, marking the end of
   the world. The three dragons fall into the volcano. The Destroyer had
   entered and after fighting with Malefor, Spyro and Cynder plummet into
   the center of the earth as they continue their battle. Malefor
   proclaimed that he is eternal, unable to be defeated, but is then
   sealed away in the world's core by the spirits of the ancestors and the
   green chain disappears soon after.

   Despite Malefor's defeat, the world is still falling apart, as Spyro
   and Cynder wonder if this is indeed the end. Ignitus' spirit returns
   and gives Spyro hope. With the chain that bound them together broken
   with Malefor's defeat, Spyro tells Cynder to flee while he stops the
   catastrophe, but she refuses to leave him. As Spyro prepares to unleash
   a powerful Fury wave, Cynder verbally reveals that she loves him. The
   world is rebuilt by Spyro's magic and the remaining Dragon Guardians,
   Hunter, Sparx and the survivors emerge from underground into the
   setting sun as stars in the sky formed into the figure of a dragon.

   After the credits, the Chronicler speaks to someone that a new age is
   beginning and with each new age. A worthy dragon is chosen to record
   the triumphs and failures of that era. His time is over, but the time
   of the new chronicler, Ignitus, has just begun. Before passing his
   mantle, the Chronicler informs Ignitus that though he has tried his
   best, he cannot find "any trace of Spyro" in the book that details
   dragons who have died. As Ignitus becomes the new chronicler, he
   wonders where Spyro could be. Meanwhile, as the game closes, a glimpse
   of Spyro and Cynder can be seen flying together over the Valley of
   Avalar.
