   The book is presented as a dialogue between "a Grandmaster of the
   Knights Hospitaller and a Genoese Sea-Captain". Inspired by Plato's
   Republic and the description of Atlantis in Timaeus, it describes a
   theocratic society where goods, women and children are held in common.
   It also resembles the City of Adocentyn in the Picatrix, an Arabic
   grimoire of astrological magic. In the final part of the work,
   Campanella prophesies--in the veiled language of astrology--that the
   Spanish kings, in alliance with the Pope, are destined to be the
   instruments of a Divine Plan: the final victory of the True Faith and
   its diffusion in the whole world. While one could argue that Campanella
   was simply thinking of the conquest of the New World, it seems that
   this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written
   shortly before The City of the Sun, The Monarchy in Spain, in which
   Campanella exposes his vision of a unified, peaceful world governed by
   a theocratic monarchy.
