   Norman Bates, a middle-aged bachelor, is dominated by his mother, a
   mean-tempered, puritanical old woman who forbids him to have a life
   outside of her. They run a small motel together in the town of
   Fairvale, but business has floundered since the state relocated the
   highway. In the middle of a heated argument between them, a customer
   arrives, a young woman named Mary Crane.

   Mary is on the run after impulsively stealing $40,000 from a client of
   the real estate company where she works. She stole the money so her
   boyfriend, Sam Loomis, could pay off his debts and they could finally
   get married. Mary arrives at the Bates Motel after accidentally turning
   off the main highway. Exhausted, she accepts Bates' invitation to have
   dinner with him at his house, an invitation that sends Mrs. Bates into
   a jealous rage; she screams, "I'll kill the bitch!", which Mary then
   hears.

   During dinner, Mary gently suggests that Bates put his mother in a
   mental institution, but he denies there is anything wrong with her; "We
   all go a little mad sometimes", he says. Mary says goodnight and
   returns to her room, resolving to return the money so she will not end
   up like Bates. Moments later in the shower, however, a figure
   resembling an old woman frightens Mary with a butcher knife, and then
   beheads her.

   Bates, who had passed out drunk after dinner, returns to the motel and
   finds Mary's bloody corpse. He is instantly convinced his mother is the
   murderer. He briefly considers letting her go to prison, but changes
   his mind after having a nightmare in which she sinks in quicksand, only
   to turn into him as she goes under. His mother comes to comfort him,
   and he decides to dispose of Mary's body, belongings, and car in the
   swamp, and go on with life as usual.

   Meanwhile, Mary's sister, Lila, tells Sam of her sister's
   disappearance. They are soon joined by Milton Arbogast, a private
   investigator hired by Mary's boss to retrieve the money. Sam and Lila
   agree to let Arbogast lead the search for Mary. Arbogast eventually
   meets up with Bates, who says that Mary had left after one night; when
   he asks to talk with his mother, Bates refuses. This arouses Arbogast's
   suspicion, and he calls Lila and tells her that he is going to try to
   talk to Mrs. Bates. When he enters the house, the same mysterious
   figure who killed Mary ambushes him in the foyer, and kills him with a
   razor.

   Sam and Lila go to Fairvale to look for Arbogast, and meet with the
   town sheriff, who tells them that Mrs. Bates has been dead for years,
   having committed suicide by poisoning her lover and herself. The young
   Norman had a nervous breakdown after finding them and was sent for a
   time to a mental institution. Sam and Lila go to the motel to
   investigate. Sam distracts Bates while Lila goes to get the
   sheriff--but she actually proceeds up to the house to investigate on
   her own. There she finds various books on occultism, abnormal
   psychology, metaphysics and Marquis de Sade, in his bedroom. During a
   conversation with Sam, Bates says that his mother had only pretended to
   be dead, and had communicated with him while he was in the institution.
   Bates then tells Sam that Lila tricked him and went up to the house and
   that his mother was waiting for her. Bates then knocks Sam unconscious
   with a liquor bottle that he'd been drinking from. At the house, Lila
   is horrified to discover Mrs. Bates's mummified corpse on the floor, in
   the fruit cellar. As she screams, a figure rushes into the room with a
   knife--Norman Bates, dressed in his mother's clothes. Sam regains
   consciousness, enters the room and subdues Norman before he can harm
   Lila.

   At the police station, Sam talks to a psychiatrist who had examined
   Bates, while the county highway crew is out dredging the swamp to
   uncover the automobiles, revealing the bodies of Mary and Arbogast; a
   media frenzy imagines countless additional victims to be uncovered if
   the swamp is further drained, but "the newspaper writers didn't have to
   foot the bill for such a project." Sam learns that Bates and his mother
   had lived together in a state of total codependence ever since his
   father deserted them when he was still a young child. Along the way,
   introverted, awkward, and filled with seething rage, Norman became a
   secret transvestite, impersonating his mother. A bookworm, he became
   fascinated with the occult, spiritualism, and Satanism. When his mother
   took a lover named Joe Considine, Bates went over the edge with
   jealousy and poisoned them both, forging a suicide note in his mother's
   handwriting. To suppress the guilt of matricide, he developed a
   dissociative identity disorder ("split personality") in the outside
   world. He retrieved her corpse from the cemetery and preserved it and,
   whenever the illusion was threatened, would drink heavily, dress in her
   clothes and speak to himself in her voice. The "Mother" personality
   killed Mary because "she" was jealous of Norman feeling affection for
   another woman.

   Bates is declared psychotic and put in a mental institution for life.
   Days later, the "Mother" personality completely takes over Bates's
   mind; he virtually becomes his mother. However, in a double-twist
   ending, "Mother" reveals she had to take over, as Norman's personality
   was actually the murderous psychotic one, and that "she" in fact
   couldn't hurt a fly.
