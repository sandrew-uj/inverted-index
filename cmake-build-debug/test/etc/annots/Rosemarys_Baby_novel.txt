   The book centers on Rosemary Woodhouse, a young woman who has just
   moved into the Bramford, a historic Gothic Revival-style New York City
   apartment building, with her husband, Guy, a struggling actor. Guy has
   so far appeared only in small roles in the stage plays Luther, Nobody
   Loves an Albatross, and various TV commercials. The pair is warned that
   the Bramford has a disturbing history involving witchcraft and murder,
   but they discount this. Rosemary wants to start a family, but Guy
   prefers waiting until his career is more established.

   Neighbors Minnie and Roman Castevet, an eccentric, elderly couple,
   welcome Rosemary and Guy to the Bramford. Rosemary finds them
   meddlesome and annoying, but Guy begins frequently visiting them.

   After the lead actor in a new stage play suddenly goes blind, Guy is
   cast in the role. Immediately afterward, Guy unexpectedly agrees with
   Rosemary that they should have their first child. That night, Rosemary
   dreams of a rough sexual encounter with a huge, inhuman creature with
   yellow eyes. The next morning Rosemary finds claw marks on her breasts
   and groin, which Guy dismisses from him having a hangnail. Rosemary
   subsequently learns that she is pregnant.

   Rosemary falls severely ill; but her intense pain and weight loss are
   ignored by others and attributed to hysteria. Her doctor and Minnie
   feed her strange and foul concoctions. Rosemary also develops a
   peculiar craving for raw meat.

   Guy's performance in the play garners favorable notices, and other
   increasingly significant roles follow. Guy soon begin talking about a
   career in Hollywood.

   Rosemary's friend, Edward "Hutch" Hutchins, also becomes mysteriously
   ill. He had sent Rosemary a warning, leading to her discovery that
   Roman Castevets is the leader of a Satanic coven. She suspects her
   unborn baby is wanted as a sacrifice to the devil. Despite her growing
   conviction, she is unable to convince anyone, particularly Guy.
   Ultimately, Rosemary discovers the coven's real intent for wanting her
   baby. He is the Antichrist, and Satan is the father.
