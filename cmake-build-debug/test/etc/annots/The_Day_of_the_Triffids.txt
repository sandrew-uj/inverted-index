   The protagonist is Bill Masen, a biologist who has made his living
   working with triffids--tall, venomous, carnivorous plants capable of
   locomotion. Due to his background, Masen suspects they were
   bioengineered in the U.S.S.R. and accidentally released into the wild.
   Because of the excellent industrial quality of an oil produced by and
   obtained from the triffids, the result is triffid cultivation around
   the world.

   The narrative begins with Bill Masen in hospital, his eyes bandaged
   after having been splashed with triffid poison from a stinger. During
   his convalescence he is told of an unexpected green meteor shower. The
   next morning, he learns that the light from the unusual display has
   rendered any who watched it blind (later in the book, Masen speculates
   that the "meteor shower" may have been orbiting satellite weapons,
   triggered accidentally). After unbandaging his eyes he finds the
   hospital in chaos, with staff and patients without sight. He wanders
   through a chaotic London full of blind inhabitants and slowly becomes
   enamoured of wealthy novelist Josella Playton, whom he rescues after
   discovering her being forcibly used as a guide by a blind man.
   Intrigued by a single light on top of the Senate House in an otherwise
   darkened London, Bill and Josella discover a group of sighted survivors
   led by a man named Beadley, who plans to establish a colony in the
   countryside. They decide to join the group.

   The polygamy implicit in Beadley's scheme appalls some group members,
   especially the religious Miss Durrant--but before this schism can be
   dealt with, a man named Wilfred Coker stages a fire at the university
   and kidnaps a number of sighted individuals, including Bill and
   Josella. They are each chained to a blind person and assigned to lead a
   squadron of the blind, collecting food and other supplies, all the
   while beset by escaped triffids and rival scavengers.

   Soon Masen's followers begin to fall sick and die of an unknown
   disease. When he wakes one morning to find the survivors have left him,
   he returns to the University Tower to seek Josella but his only lead is
   an address left behind by Beadley's group. Joined by a repentant Coker,
   Masen drives to the address, a country estate called Tynsham in
   Wiltshire. He finds part of the Beadley group, now led by Miss Durrant,
   who eventually tells him that Beadley went to Beaminster, in Dorset, a
   few days before he arrived. There has been no sign of Josella.

   Masen and Coker decide to follow Beadley to Dorset. They find small
   groups of blind and sighted people along the way but no trace of
   Beadley. Eventually they decide to separate, Coker returning to help at
   Tynsham, while Masen heads for the Sussex Downs after remembering a
   remark Josella made about friends she had there.

   En route, Masen rescues a young sighted girl named Susan, whom he finds
   trapped alone at home, while her young brother lies dead in the garden,
   killed by a triffid. He buries the boy and takes Susan with him. A few
   days later, during a night of heavy rain, they see a faint light in the
   distance. Upon reaching it, they discover Josella and her friends.

   They attempt to establish a self-sufficient colony in Sussex with some
   success but they are constantly under threat from the triffids, which
   mass around the fenced exterior. Several years pass, until one day a
   representative of Beadley's faction lands a helicopter in their yard
   and reports that his group has established a colony on the Isle of
   Wight. Durrant's talk of Beaminster was a deliberate attempt to throw
   Masen off on his journey to find Beadley. While Bill and the others are
   reluctant to leave their own settlement, the group decide to see the
   summer out in Sussex before moving to the Isle of Wight.

   Their plans are hurried by the arrival of the militaristic
   representatives of a new despotic and self-appointed government, who
   arrive in an armoured car. Masen recognises the leader as a ruthless
   young man he had encountered on a scavenging expedition in London and
   whom he had watched cold-bloodedly execute one of his own party who had
   fallen ill. The latter plans to give Masen a large number of blind
   people to care for, and use on the farm as slave labour; he will also
   take Susan as hostage. Feigning agreement, Masen's group throw a party,
   during which they encourage the visitors to get drunk. Creeping out of
   the house whilst the visitors are fast asleep, they disable the
   armoured car by pouring honey into the fuel tank and drive through the
   gates, leaving them open for the triffids to pour in. The novel ends
   with Masen's group on the Isle of Wight, determined one day to destroy
   the triffids and reclaim their world.
