   Set in the noughties, the series focuses on a group of ordinary people
   who survive the aftermath of a devastating viral pandemic - referred to
   as "European flu" - which kills most of the world's population by
   causing cytokine storms in the body's immune system. The series
   sees the characters struggling against terrible dangers in a world with
   no society, no police, and no law, led by the de facto matriarch of
   the group, Abby Grant.
