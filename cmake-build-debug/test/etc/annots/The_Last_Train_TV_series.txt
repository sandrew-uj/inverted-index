   A random group of individuals on a train travelling between London and
   Sheffield are cryogenically frozen when the train crashes inside a
   tunnel and a canister of gas being carried by a passenger is released
   in their carriage. They unfreeze to find the United Kingdom in ruins.
   Unbeknownst to them, 52 years have passed. They wrongly believe weeks,
   then months, then just 14 years have passed whilst they were frozen in
   time before eventually finding out the devastating truth. They are some
   of the few humans to have survived an apocalyptic asteroid strike and
   are alone in the British countryside. It is revealed that the passenger
   with the gas canister, Harriet Ambrose (Nicola Walker), knew of the
   incoming asteroid strike and had been on her way to a top-secret
   government project known as Ark.

   Harriet wishes to track down the Ark team to find her boyfriend,
   scientist Jonathan Geddes (Ralph Brown). The rest of the group agrees
   to join her, since it seems like their best chance to find other
   survivors and a safe haven. On the way, they must deal with the dangers
   of the post-apocalyptic world, such as feral dog packs and tribes of
   seemingly hostile humans... children of the few original survivors.
