   An introduction states that two canonical Holmes adventures were
   fabrications. These are "The Final Problem", in which Holmes apparently
   died along with Prof. James Moriarty, and "The Empty House", wherein
   Holmes reappeared after a three-year absence and revealed that he had
   not been killed after all. The Seven-Per-Cent Solution's Watson
   explains that they were published to conceal the truth concerning
   Holmes' "Great Hiatus".

   The novel begins in 1891, when Holmes first informs Watson of his
   belief that Professor James Moriarty is a "Napoleon of Crime". The
   novel presents this view as nothing more than the fevered imagining of
   Holmes' cocaine-sodden mind and further asserts that Moriarty was the
   childhood mathematics tutor of Sherlock and his brother Mycroft. Watson
   meets Moriarty, who denies that he is a criminal and reluctantly
   threatens to pursue legal action unless the latter's accusations cease.
   Moriarty also refers to a "great tragedy" in Holmes' childhood, but
   refuses to explain further when pressed by Watson.

   The heart of the novel consists of an account of Holmes' recovery from
   his addiction. Knowing that Sherlock would never willingly see a doctor
   about his addiction and mental problems, Watson and Holmes' brother
   Mycroft induce Holmes to travel to Vienna, where Watson introduces him
   to Dr. Freud. Using a treatment consisting largely of hypnosis, Freud
   helps Holmes shake off his addiction and his delusions about Moriarty,
   but neither he nor Watson can revive Holmes' dejected spirit.

   What finally does the job is a whiff of mystery: one of the doctor's
   patients is kidnapped and Holmes' curiosity is sufficiently aroused.
   The case takes the three men on a breakneck train ride across Austria
   in pursuit of a foe who is about to launch a war involving all of
   Europe. Holmes remarks during the denouement that they have succeeded
   only in postponing such a conflict, not preventing it; Holmes would
   later become involved in a "European War" in 1914.

   One final hypnosis session reveals a key traumatic event in Holmes'
   childhood: his father murdered his mother for adultery and committed
   suicide afterwards. Moriarty was the lover of Holmes' mother, and as
   such was indirectly responsible for their deaths. From that point on,
   his onetime tutor became a dark and malignant figure in Holmes'
   subconscious. Freud and Watson conclude that Holmes, consciously unable
   to face the emotional ramifications of this event, has pushed them deep
   into his unconscious while finding outlets in fighting evil, pursuing
   justice, and many of his famous eccentricities, including his cocaine
   habit. However, they decide not to discuss these subjects with Holmes,
   believing that he would not accept them, and that it would needlessly
   complicate his recovery.

   Watson returns to London, but Holmes decides to travel alone for a
   while, advising Watson to claim that he had been killed, and thus the
   famed "Great Hiatus" is more or less preserved. It is during these
   travels that the events of Meyer's sequel The Canary Trainer occur.
