   A mysterious bacteria has escaped a lab and is causing all the "dead
   folks" to re-animate. Bounty hunter Wayne (no last name given) is
   hunting his quarry Calhoun in a "Dead Dancing" bar where patrons pay to
   dance with female zombies and sometimes other things... After a violent
   struggle, Wayne manages to handcuff Calhoun who's wanted for raping and
   murdering a young girl. In order to collect his bounty, Wayne has to
   cross the Cadillac Desert to a place called Lawtown where criminals are
   executed by being pulled apart by tractors. Calhoun advises Wayne to
   sleep with one eye open as Calhoun has managed to kill every other
   bounty hunter that has pursued him. Wayne's dream is to collect enough
   money to buy a wrecking yard and retire from bounty hunting as he knew
   his luck would sooner or later run out. And besides Wayne is weary from
   the whole lifestyle and people like Calhoun.

   The Cadillac Desert stretches for miles with old Cadillacs buried
   halfway in the ground at a slant. They were the result of the
   Chevy/Cadillac wars that took place years ago with the Chevy's being
   victorious. As Wayne and Calhoun descend deeper into the Cadillac
   Desert, a sandstorm suddenly starts and visibility is reduced to almost
   zero. Suddenly a large object looms in front of them and they crash
   into it taking out Wayne's Chevy. Suddenly the rotted faces of the dead
   folks appear and Wayne and Calhoun figure it's the end. However instead
   of being eaten they are led to the object that Wayne recognizes as a
   school bus. On board they are confronted by a nun dressed in very
   provocative clothing armed with a shotgun. They are introduced to
   Brother Lazarus who is driving the bus. Wayne observes the bus is
   equipped with radar and collided with them on purpose. Soon they arrive
   at a converted theme park that used to be Disneyland. Wayne observes
   that the dead folks have strange-looking ears (Mickey Mouse) and a bolt
   sticking out of their heads. This bolt is how they are controlled by
   Brother Lazarus.

   Soon Wayne is befriended by a nun named Sister Worth who wants to leave
   "Jesusland" and tells Wayne of Brother Lazarus's plans for the two men
   which aren't very nice. So Wayne and Calhoun agree to a pact: Along
   with Sister Worth, they help each other escape and then settle their
   differences.
