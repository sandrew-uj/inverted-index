   Biron Farrill, about to complete studies at the University of Earth, is
   told by Sander Jonti that his father, a rich planetary leader who is
   known as Lord Rancher of Widemos, has been arrested and killed by the
   Tyranni and that his own life may be in danger. On Jonti's advice, he
   travels to Rhodia, the strongest of the conquered planets. There, from
   the Director of Rhodia's brother Gillbret, he hears rumours of a world
   on which rebellion against the Tyranni is secretly being plotted.

   Escaping with Artemisia oth Hinriad, the daughter of the Director of
   Rhodia and her uncle Gillbret in a Tyranni spaceship, they travel to
   the planet Lingane. It is not part of the Tyranni conquests but
   maintains "peaceful" relations with them.

   There, they meet the Autarch of Lingane, who is revealed to be Sander
   Jonti, the man who sent Farrill to Rhodia from Earth, who seems to
   possess knowledge of a rebellion world. With him and his followers, the
   group travel to the heart of the Horsehead Nebula and believe that for
   any rebellion world to exist and not be known to the Tyranni, it must
   be located in a place like the Horsehead Nebula.

   The Tyranni spaceship that was stolen by Farrill is being tracked by a
   fleet of Tyranni vessels led by Simok Aratap, the Tyrannian
   Commissioner. With him is the Director, who is shown to be nervous
   about the well-being of his daughter and his brother. They keep
   themselves at a distance for fear of Farrill discovering them until
   Farrill lands on one planet in the heart of the nebula.

   The Autarch believes that the planet is the rebellion world. However,
   there is no sign of life anywhere. When the Autarch and Farrill leave
   the spaceship, apparently to set up a radio transmitter, Farrill faces
   the Autarch and accuses him of getting his father killed at the hands
   of the Tyranni. The Autarch affirms the accusation, and Farrill adds
   that the Autarch feared his father's growing reputation and so caused
   Farrill's father's death.

   In a fight, Farrill subdues the Autarch with help from the Autarch's
   aide, Tedor Rizzet, who reveals that he is ashamed of the Autarch for
   killing a great man like Farrill's father. Later, as Farrill and Rizzet
   try to explain everything to the rest of the crew they picked up from
   Lingane, the Tyranni fleet arrives and takes them prisoner. Aratap
   interrogates Farrill, Artemisia, Gillbret, and Rizzet to ascertain the
   co-ordinates of the rebellion world, but they do not know where it is.
   However, the Autarch reveals the information to Aratap. Rizzet kills
   the Autarch with a blaster in anger.

   While Aratap interrogates Farrill, Gillbret manages to escape to the
   engine room of the spaceship and short the hyperatomics. Farrill,
   realizing the danger, manages to contact Aratap. The engines are
   repaired, but Gillbret is injured and later dies.

   The space jump is made with the co-ordinates given to them by the late
   Autarch. However, they find a planetless system with only a white-dwarf
   star. Aratap lets Farrill and the others go, believing that there is no
   rebellion world. Aratap makes it clear that he will never be chosen as
   Director. Biron and Artemisia are allowed to marry.

   It is eventually revealed that there is indeed a rebellion in the
   making, on Rhodia itself, with the Director as its leader; he
   deliberately took on the persona of a nervous and timid old man to
   throw off suspicion from himself and his planet.

   It is further revealed that the Director, who possesses a collection of
   ancient documents, has searched for and has found a document that will
   help a future empire, likely Trantor, govern the galaxy. The document
   is eventually revealed to be the United States Constitution.
