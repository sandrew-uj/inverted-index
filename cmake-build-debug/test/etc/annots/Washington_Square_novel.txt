   The bitterest irony in the story is that Dr. Sloper, a brilliant and
   successful doctor, is exactly right about Morris Townsend, and yet he
   is cruel to his defenseless and loving daughter. If the doctor had been
   incorrect in his appraisal of the worthless Townsend, he would be only
   a stock villain. As it is, the doctor's head functions perfectly but
   his heart has grown cold after the death of his beautiful and gifted
   wife.

   Catherine gradually grows throughout the story, ultimately gaining the
   ability to judge her situation accurately. As James puts it: "From her
   point of view the great facts of her career were that Morris Townsend
   had trifled with her affection, and that her father had broken its
   spring. Nothing could ever alter these facts; they were always there,
   like her name, her age, her plain face. Nothing could ever undo the
   wrong or cure the pain that Morris had inflicted on her, and nothing
   could ever make her feel towards her father as she felt in her younger
   years." Catherine will never be brilliant, but she learns to be
   clear-sighted.
