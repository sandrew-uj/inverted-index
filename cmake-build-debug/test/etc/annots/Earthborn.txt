   Five centuries after the conclusion of Earthfall, there is only one
   original colonist from Harmony: Shedemei, who now wears the Cloak of
   the Starmaster (a device that links her to the Oversoul). After
   hundreds of years, the descendants of Nafai and Elemak have built
   cities and towns - yet never forgetting the enmity between the two
   brothers. After hundreds of years, the Oversoul still has not achieved
   its original purpose: to find the Keeper of Earth, the central
   intelligence that alone can repair the Oversoul's damaged counterpart
   at Harmony.

   But now, the Keeper has once again begun to spread its influence.
   Heeding the dreams below, Shedemei has decided to return to Earth.

   The last book in the Homecoming saga marks a departure from the style
   and storyline of the previous four. All of the characters from the
   previous novels (except Shedemei) are long dead. The central conflict
   between Nafai and Elemak is represented in their descendants, but takes
   a back seat in this book. The focus is on the struggles within the
   descendants of those who followed Nafai. The king of Darakemba (an
   empire founded by the Nafaris), his children, and his advisers, along
   with the high priest of Darakemba, his children, and his converts,
   provide the main actions in the story.
