   The book takes its title from a verse from Andrew Marvell's "To His Coy
   Mistress": "The grave's a fine and private place, / But none, I think,
   do there embrace." The setting, accordingly, is the fictional
   Yorkchester Cemetery, where one Jonathan Rebeck, a homeless and
   bankrupt pharmacist who has dropped out of society, has been living,
   illegally and unobtrusively, for nearly two decades. He is maintained
   by a raven who, like the legendary ravens who fed Elijah in the
   wilderness, supplies him with food in the form of sandwiches thieved
   from nearby businesses.

   The protagonist exhibits the peculiar ability to converse with both the
   raven and the shades of the dead who haunt the cemetery. Beagle
   portrays ghosts as being bound to the vicinity of their burial, with
   their minds and memories slowly fading away as their mortal forms
   return to the dust. As the plot proceeds, Rebeck befriends two recently
   arrived spirits, those of teacher Michael Morgan, who died either from
   poisoning by his wife or suicide (he can't remember which), and of
   bookshop clerk Laura Durand, who was killed by a truck. The two ghosts
   fall in love, and each pledge themselves to each other "for as long as
   I can remember love."

   Rebeck soon finds himself subject to another's attentions as well, in
   the form of a widow, Mrs. Klapper, who discovers him while visiting her
   husband's mausoleum. The quiet existence of this unlikely quintet is
   diverted by philosophical conversation and the poisoning trial of
   Morgan's wife, word of which is regularly provided by the raven from
   the local newspapers.

   After she is ultimately found innocent and her husband's death ruled
   suicide, Morgan faces separation from Laura when his body is removed to
   unhallowed ground. Rebeck, under the encouragement of Mrs. Klapper, is
   driven to find a way to reunite them, and finally takes leave of his
   unusual abode.
