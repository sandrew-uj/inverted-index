   At the start of Children of the Mind, Jane, the evolved computer
   intelligence, is using her newly discovered abilities to take the races
   of buggers, humans and pequeninos outside the universe and back
   instantaneously. She uses these powers to move them to distant
   habitable planets for colonization. She is losing her memory and
   concentration as the vast computer network connected to the ansible is
   being shut down. If she is to survive, she must find a way to transfer
   her aiua (or soul) to a human body.

   Peter Wiggin and Si Wang-Mu travel to the worlds of Divine Wind and
   Pacifica to persuade the Japanese-led swing group of the Starways
   Congress to revoke their order to destroy Lusitania. By tracing the
   decision-making trail backwards, they are able to show a philosopher
   his influence on the Starways Congress. After several complications,
   the philosopher persuades the Tsutsumi clan to exert their influence
   with the Necessarian faction in the Starways Congress to stop the
   Lusitania fleet. The admiral at the head of the Lusitania fleet,
   however, disobeys the Congress's order and does what he believes Ender
   Wiggin, the perpetrator of the first Xenocide, would have done and
   fires the Molecular Disruption Device (MDD).

   Upon Ender Wiggin's death, Jane guides his aiua to Peter's body, while
   she is granted possession of Young Val's body, and thus is not
   destroyed when the ansible shuts down. She is then able to continue
   transporting starships instantaneously by borrowing the vast mental
   capacity of the simple-minded Pequenino mother-trees. She transports a
   ship with Peter and Wang-Mu around the missile, then transports the
   missile and them to inside of the Lusitania fleet, where it is then
   disarmed and disabled. Peter and Wang-Mu's efforts finally come to
   fruition, and the destruction of Lusitania is averted.

   Jane falls in love with Miro, and Peter with Wang-mu. Both couples are
   married under one of the mother-trees of the pequeninos on the same day
   as Ender's funeral.
