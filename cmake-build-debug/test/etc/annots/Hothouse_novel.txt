   Lily-yo, leader of a small, matriarchal human tribe, decides that the
   group should break up, as the adults are too old, and should go to the
   "Tips", the dangerous top levels of the forest, to go "Up".
   "Burnurns" - transparent seed-casings - are collected, and the adults
   seal themselves inside after which the young attach them to the webs of
   the giant spider-like plants called "Traversers", which travel into
   space to receive more intense sunlight and escape the parasitic
   tigerflies; as planned a traverser brushes against the sticky pods and
   carries them to the moon (which now has a breatheable atmosphere).

   The unconscious adults reach their destination, where they discover
   they have transformed into "Flymen", mutated by space radiation into
   flight-capable forms. They meet others and are impressed into an
   expedition back to Earth to kidnap human children to increase the
   Flymen population. They hide inside a Traverser to make the return
   journey to Earth.

   Back in the jungle, Toy is now the new leader. While attempting to kill
   a large seed-shaped "suckerbird", the tribe accidentally become
   passengers on the suckerbird. After a long flight, they crash on the
   coast at the base of a "termight" castle on a peninsula. Walking back
   to the forest through "Nomansland" - the lethal interface-area between
   land and sea - Gren is waylaid by a "morel", a sentient fungus which
   attaches itself to his head and forms a symbiotic relationship. After a
   power-struggle, Gren leaves the tribe with his girlfriend Poyly, also
   taken over by the morel.

   On their travels, they meet Yattmur of the Herder tribe, who live in
   caves in a congealed lava bed. At the "Skirt of the black mouth", an
   unknown creature with Siren-like capabilities almost leads them to
   their deaths. Escaping, they meet the Tummy-belly men, some of whom
   they free by cutting the umbilical cords by which they are attached to
   a parasitic tree. All board a boat belonging to the tummy-bellies, but
   during the escape Poyly is killed. The boat, uncontrolled, floats
   downriver into the sea. After several adventures, the crew find
   themselves on an iceberg, the boat destroyed, after which the berg
   abuts a small islet. They leave by hitching a ride on a plant which
   propagates by using self-propelled, stilt-walking seeds, which
   instinctively walk to the mainland.

   They find themselves at the terminator, the boundary between the day
   and night sides. To their horror, they realise they are being carried
   over it. After a long journey, the seed stops near the top of a
   mountain, which is tall enough to still be lit by the low sun. There,
   Yattmur gives birth to Gren's child and they meet the Sharp-furs. They
   meet the Sodal Ye and his three helpers. Gren, increasingly taken over
   by the morel, wants the baby to host it as well. In return for food,
   the Sodal Ye thinks of a way to remove the morel from Gren's head by
   coaxing it into a bowl.

   They decide to accompany the Sodal Ye back to Bountiful Basin, an arm
   of the sea close to the terminator. On the way they witness a solar
   flare. The morel explains to them that the world is about to end as the
   Sun brightens, and the strange, green columns they begin to see beaming
   into space is life itself, transferring to new stars.

   Followed by sharp-furs and others, they notice a traverser has landed
   and blocked the passage to their destination. This is the traverser
   that was carrying Lily-yo and companions. The morel manages to take
   over the Sodal Ye and when they reach the giant spider, Gren meets
   Lily-yo again. They board a traverser which is going to lift off to the
   stars (after being taken over by the morel which has now divided) - all
   except Gren, Yattmur, and the baby, who decide to return to the
   familiar forest - for the end of the world, while soon, will not occur
   within any of their lifetimes.
