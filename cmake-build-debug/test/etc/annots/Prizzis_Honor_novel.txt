   The opening lines of the New York Times review summarize the
   complexities of the novel:

     CHARLEY PARTANNA, underboss of the Prizzi crime family, has a
     problem. He's just bumped off a traitor in Vegas who'd fleeced the
     organization to the tune of $720,000 - and now he's discovered that
     his new girlfriend, Irene, was the dead man's wife. As if that
     weren't enough of a headache, Charley's also learned that she's been
     augmenting her income as a tax consultant by working as a freelance
     hitter, and that she's now been offered a contract by a family rival
     to do the number on him. What a business for a woman! Charley
     grouses. This is a serious thing. We were going to get married. You
     think she decided what business? asks his father, Angelo,
     consigliere to the Prizzis. She's an American! She had a chance to
     win even more money so she grabbed it!

   Complexity builds upon complexity, irony builds upon irony, murder
   follows murder, and tension mounts as the improbable story of the two
   married killers races to its climax.
