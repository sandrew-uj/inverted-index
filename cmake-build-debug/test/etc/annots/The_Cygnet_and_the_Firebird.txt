   Two strangers disrupt the settled life of the inhabitants of Ro
   Holding, the Hold of the Cygnet, and particularly cousins, Meguet
   Vervaine, warrior-maid, and Nyx, sorceress and daughter of the Holder
   Lauro Ro.

   Meguet stands guard outside a council meeting when the wily, powerful
   mage Rad Ilex invades the chamber, seeking an ancient object of power
   hidden in the castle. Meguet and Nyx are able to resist his spell, and
   Nyx, ignorant of what the mage is looking for, bars Rad from his
   search.

   Afterwards a magical firebird arrives, whose anguished cries and fiery
   breath transform people and things into jeweled trees. Moonlight
   restores them to their original forms, and the firebird to his--that of
   a tormented, partly amnesiac young man named Brand, son and heir of
   Draken, half-dragon king of the land of Saphier. Unraveling the mystery
   of Brand's enchantment and breaking the curse on him become prime goals
   of the protagonists.

   The thwarted Rad, returning, fights Brand and is wounded. He flees,
   abducting Meguet. Nyx follows, having found what Rad seeks, a magical
   key containing the spells of the long-dead wizard Chrysom.

   To save her cousin, free Brand, and learn the cause of Rad and Draken's
   enmity, Nyx travels to distant Saphier across the eerie, dragon-haunted
   desert of Luxour, whose slumbering denizens Draken seems intent on
   awakening.
