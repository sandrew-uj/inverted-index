   Ahern produced twenty-seven novels in numbered sequence, plus two
   un-numbered novels which fit between 15/16 and 21/22, selling 3.5
   million copies in total.

   The first few books cover Rourke's attempts to find his family, on the
   way fighting invading Soviet troops as well as typical post-apocalyptic
   villains such as biker gangs, mutants and cannibals in extended scenes
   of graphic violence. Later books head more into science fiction with
   cryonics, doomsday weapons and underwater cities.

   Starting in 2007, audio versions started to be released by Graphic
   Audio covering the entire series of novels. The last book released in
   2011.

   The series was long out of print, until the continuation of the series
   in The Inheritors of Earth which was released June 2013. However e-book
   versions of the entire series are available.

   Some of the books were translated into Polish. Also a French publisher
   (see below) extended the series.. The Finnish
   translations were titled as "Voittaja" (meaning "the Winner") series.
   However the original "Survivalist" logo was included as well on the
   Finnish version covers.
