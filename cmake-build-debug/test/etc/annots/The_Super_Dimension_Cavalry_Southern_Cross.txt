   In the year 2120, humanity has left the Solar System and
   started the colonization of other planets. One of the farthest colonies
   is located on the terraformed planet Glorie. The powerful army of the
   Southern Cross protects the colonists there from any unknown dangers.
   However, unbeknownst to the humans, Glorie is also the ancestral home
   of the Zor, a highly advanced race of nomadic humanoid aliens who have
   returned to reclaim their world.
