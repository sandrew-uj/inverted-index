   The early part of the film follows the experience of a late
   19th-century journalist from Woking, known as "the writer", involved
   with the landing of a Martian invasion spacecraft. When the crashed
   cylinder opens, the Martians start killing anything that moves with a
   "heat ray" weapon. The writer discovers his house is in range of their
   heat ray and decides to rush his wife and servant to her cousins' home
   in Leatherhead; once there, he returns in order to return the borrowed
   cart to its owner, unaware that the invading Martians are now on the
   move.

   The Martians have built tall tripod "fighting machines" and begun a
   destructive rampage across southern England. The film also details the
   adventures of his brother, a student in London, who accompanies two
   ladies to the east coast of England in order to escape from the
   slaughter and destruction wrought by the Martians.

   When the writer tries to get back to his wife in Leatherhead, he is
   confounded and beset by many problems as a result of the chaos brought
   by the Martian invasion.
