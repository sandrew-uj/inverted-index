   The Age of Innocence, which was set in the time of Wharton's childhood,
   was a softer and gentler work than The House of Mirth, which Wharton
   had published in 1905. In her autobiography, Wharton wrote of The Age
   of Innocence that it had allowed her to find "a momentary escape in
   going back to my childish memories of a long-vanished America... it was
   growing more and more evident that the world I had grown up in and been
   formed by had been destroyed in 1914." Scholars and readers alike
   agree that The Age of Innocence is fundamentally a story which
   struggles to reconcile the old with the new.

   Wharton was raised in the old world of rigid and proper New York
   society which features in the story. She had spent her middle years,
   including the whole of World War I, in Europe, where the devastation of
   a new kind of mechanized warfare was felt most deeply. As explained by
   Millicent Bell in the Cambridge companion to Wharton, "The Age of
   Innocence was composed and first read in the aftermath of 
   Roosevelt's death and in the immediate wake of World War I. We frame
   the ending remembering the multiple losses... not only the loss of
   Roosevelt but the destruction of the prewar world and all that Wharton
   valued in it."

   The Age of Innocence centers on an upper-class couple's impending
   marriage, and the introduction of the bride's cousin, plagued by
   scandal, whose presence threatens their happiness. Though the novel
   questions the assumptions and morals of 1870s New York society, it
   never develops into an outright condemnation of the institution. The
   novel is noted for Wharton's attention to detail and its accurate
   portrayal of how the 19th-century East Coast American upper class
   lived, as well as for the social tragedy of its plot. Wharton was 58
   years old at publication; she had lived in that world and had seen it
   change dramatically by the end of World War I.

   The title is an ironic comment on the polished outward manners of New
   York society when compared to its inward machinations. It is believed
   to have been drawn from the popular painting A Little Girl by Sir
   Joshua Reynolds that later became known as The Age of Innocence and was
   widely reproduced as the commercial face of childhood in the later half
   of the 18th century. The title, while ironic, was not as caustic as
   the title of the story featured in The House of Mirth, which Wharton
   had published in 1905.
