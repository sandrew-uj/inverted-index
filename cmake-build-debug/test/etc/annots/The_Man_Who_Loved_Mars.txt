   Mars, a world with a culture ages older than that of Earth, is a dying
   world, and has been in decline for eons. By the twenty-second century
   it has become a colony of the younger civilization of Earth, its
   natives oppressed by the rapacious Colonial Authority. Some of the
   newcomers are sympathetic to the natives, however, notably Ivo Tengren,
   who befriended the last of the titular high kings of Mars before the
   latter's demise. Inheriting from him both the crown and the
   responsibility to champion its people, Ivo led a doomed revolt against
   the CA, only to see it crushed and his Martian lover murdered. He
   himself has been deported back to Earth for his temerity and forbidden
   ever to return to Mars.

   In exile, Tengren spends his days idly in drink and dreams until one
   Dr. Josip Keresny approaches him. Keresny plans an expedition to locate
   the lost Martian city of Ilionis, legendary "Gateway to the Gods," and
   offers Ivo illicit passage back to the Red Planet in return for serving
   as guide and placating the Martians. Hopeless and passive, Ivo is not
   the man he once was; nonetheless, he leaps at the chance.

   The expedition proceeds, though tensions arise as Tengren develops an
   attraction to Keresny's granddaughter Ilsa and a hostile rivalry with
   pilot Konstantin Bolgov. The party also faces hostility from the
   Martians, who tolerate it only on account of their "king," even as they
   retain suspicions of him due to the debacle he led them through and his
   status as an Earthman. Eventually Ilionis is found. It indeed proves a
   gateway, to a vast system of caverns and relics of an alien technology
   older than anything remembered by the Martians.

   Ultimately the cave system leads the explorers to the resting place of
   the Timeless Ones, a trio of alien survivors of the destroyed planet
   whose remains are now the asteroid belt. Awakened, they reveal
   themselves as the beings who guided the ancestors of both Martians and
   Earthlings on the path to sentience.

   Bolgov, secretly an agent of the CA, attempts to destroy the aliens
   lest they free the Martians, but is thwarted. The Timeless Ones then
   pronounce sentence on the ruling Earthlings; for their crimes, all must
   leave Mars. Their vast mental powers give them the means to enforce
   this edict. The detached Tengren is satisfied with the outcome until he
   realizes the sentence includes him, at which point he belatedly speaks
   up for the more benignly inclined humans. The Timeless Ones grant the
   exception, giving him and Ilsa the right to remain and help rebuild
   Martian society.
