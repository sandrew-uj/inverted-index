   A massive meteor strike has devastated Earth. Human civilization comes
   to an end in the ensuing cataclysms and humanity regresses into tribes
   of Stone Age dwellers. A primordial rainforest covers the land and the
   continental landmass has shifted into the shape of a fire-breathing
   dinosaur skull. The planet is now primitively referred to as "Urth" by
   the survivors of the cataclysms.

   Seven fearsome creatures with supernatural abilities emerge from their
   slumber deep within the Urth's crust, and become worshiped as gods by
   the humans, who form segregated clans beneath the ones they follow. The
   beasts themselves are divided between those who wish to keep peace on
   Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for
   their own benefit.
