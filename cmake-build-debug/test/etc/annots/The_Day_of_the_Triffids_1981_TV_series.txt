   The series takes place in late 20th century Britain. A spectacular
   meteorite shower unexpectedly renders most of humanity blind, leading
   to the breakdown of society overnight. Unaware of this, Bill Masen
   (John Duttine) has retained his sight by virtue of being in hospital
   with his eyes bandaged at the time of the shower. Bill works on a
   Triffid farm, where the mobile and carnivorous plants are cultivated
   for their oil. Prior to the story he was stung by a plant and even
   though he was wearing protective clothing, some of the poison got into
   his eyes. In the hospital he tentatively removes the bandages and
   gradually discovers the catastrophe around him.

   He rescues Josella "Jo" Playton (Emma Relph) from her blind captor and
   finds that she had slept through the meteorite shower thus keeping her
   sight. They eventually come across a small band of similarly lucky
   survivors who have decided to leave London and establish a community
   elsewhere to begin rebuilding civilization. They are initially opposed
   by sighted Jack Coker (Maurice Colbourne), who wants them to stay in
   London and help the blind, not abandon them. When the others reject his
   scheme, he and a few sighted helpers capture some of the group,
   including Bill and Jo. He assigns each to a different group of the
   blind. Bill is handcuffed to two of his charges to prevent him leaving
   them.

   The Triffids get loose and run amok amongst the helpless blind human
   population, slaughtering and feeding on them. Between the Triffids and
   a mysterious disease, most of Bill's group eventually die; the rest
   scatter. Bill starts searching for Jo and teams up with Jack, who
   admits his plan did not work as he had hoped. They drive through the
   English countryside and encounter part of the group that had left
   London. The group had split after a disagreement over morality: the
   ones who stayed behind, led by Miss Durrant (Perlita Neilson), refused
   to accept that polygamy would be necessary to repopulate the world.
   After more fruitless searching, Jack decides to return to Miss
   Durrant's community.

   Bill meets a young girl, Susan and she accompanies him. Finally, he
   recalls that Jo had spoken of a place belonging to her friends in the
   Sussex Downs. There he is reunited with her and after erecting a
   protective fence around the farm to keep out the Triffids, they settle
   down and start raising a family. After six years, Jack shows up in a
   helicopter. Miss Durrant's group has been wiped out by the disease but
   the other faction has secured the Isle of Wight and exterminated the
   local Triffids. With the situation gradually deteriorating where they
   are, Bill, Jo, three blind friends and the children prepare to join
   them.

   Before they can go, several uniformed men arrive in an armoured car;
   they are part of an organisation that is setting up a feudal society,
   with the sighted as the new aristocracy. In their setup, one sighted
   person is in charge of ten of the blind. They plan to assign more blind
   people to Bill and Jo, and take Susan away to learn how to care for
   others. Bill gets the soldiers drunk and sabotages their armoured car.
   Then he and the rest of his people drive away, leaving the gates open
   for the besieging Triffids.
