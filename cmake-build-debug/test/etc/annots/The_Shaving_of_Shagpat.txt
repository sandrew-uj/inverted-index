   Shibli Bagarag, a Persian barber, and Noorna, an enchantress, are given
   the quest of shaving the tyrant Shagpat, who by the power of his
   magical hair holds his city in thrall. Along the way Shibli acquires a
   magic sword and meets a series of exotic creatures, including a talking
   hawk and several genies.

   The second paragraph of the book provides a capsule summary of the
   story: "Now the story of Shibli Bagarag, and of the ball he followed,
   and of the subterranean kingdom he came to, and of the enchanted palace
   he entered, and of the sleeping king he shaved, and of the two
   princesses he released, and of the Afrite held in subjection by the
   arts of one and bottled by her, is it not known as 'twere written on
   the finger-nails of men and traced in their corner robes?"
