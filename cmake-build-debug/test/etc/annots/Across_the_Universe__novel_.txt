   Hundreds of years in the future, the spaceship Godspeed travels toward
   a distant, earth-like planet with 100 cryogenically frozen settlers on
   board. Seventeen year old Amy, frozen along with her parents, wakes
   early and only to find herself in the middle of a strange, regimented
   society made up of those born on the ship over generations. With the
   help of Elder, the ship's only teenager and future leader, she must
   solve a murder mystery, and save the ship. They must hurry before the
   murderer kills any more people, and before time runs out of life.
