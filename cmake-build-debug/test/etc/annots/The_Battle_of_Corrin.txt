   The machine evermind Omnius is continuing with his plans to eradicate
   all humans in the universe. After first being suggested by the traitor
   Yorek Thurr, an RNA retrovirus is designed by the captured Tlulaxa
   Rekur Van and the independent robot Erasmus. Omnius then launches
   capsules containing the retrovirus to infect the planets inhabited by
   the hapless humans. With a 43% direct-mortality rate, the virus
   succeeds in effectively crippling the League of Nobles, leaving them
   vulnerable to attack.

   It is discovered that consumption of the spice melange has the effect
   of both bolstering immunity to the retrovirus and stopping its
   progression in some of those already infected. Omnius, unaware that the
   virus has been effectively stopped, prepares for the second phase of
   its attack. Gathering the bulk of the machine armies stationed at the
   different synchronized planets, the evermind launches the massive fleet
   towards the League capital Salusa Secundus. After learning of the
   imminent destruction headed their way in the form of the machine fleet,
   Vorian Atreides formulates a plan whereby the humans can launch
   pulse-atomic attacks on all of the undefended Synchronized Worlds,
   ridding the universe of Omnius altogether. However, this plan called
   for the use of the still unreliable space-folding technology in order
   to carry out the attacks before the machines have a chance to recall
   the fleet en route to Salusa. The Great Purge is successful in
   destroying Omnius on all but one planet, albeit with an appalling cost
   in human lives because each planet was turned into slag, and while all
   the machines were obliterated, all the captured humans and slaves on
   these planets were also killed. Each time the human armies fold space
   to a new location there is a 10% attrition rate due to the undependable
   space-folders because of the uncertainty principle. In all, it amounted
   to billions of lives lost. The humans are also unable to destroy Omnius
   on the primary synchronized world, Corrin. While the other Evermind
   incarnations are being attacked, the cogitor Vidad travels to Corrin
   and warns Corrin-Omnius of the human counter-offensive. The machine
   fleet is recalled to defend their last remaining stronghold. Despite
   this, Serena Butler's Jihad is declared over. The Great Purge ended
   with an impasse between humans and thinking machines on the planet
   Corrin. While unable to destroy the machines, the human army is able to
   trap them on Corrin by surrounding the planet with a net of scrambler
   satellites, so that any thinking machine attempting to leave would have
   its gelcircuitry mind destroyed. This situation continues for almost 20
   years with the machines unable to escape, and most humans unwilling to
   enter another battle.

   Omnius, again at the suggestion of Thurr, sends machines with primitive
   minds that can evade the scrambler network to attack Salusa Secundus
   and Rossak. These attacks have a limited effect, but are enough to
   remind the humans that the machines are still a threat. Touting his
   victory over the Titans (see below), Vorian Atreides convinces the
   League to attack Corrin. Facing robots using human shields and unable
   to use their main tactical weapons due to treachery by Abulurd
   Harkkonen, the Army of Humanity is bogged down around Corrin. They are
   forced to use most of their atomics to destroy the robot defenders.
   There is a ground offensive by Ginaz mercenaries that finally destroys
   Omnius, but not before he sends out an unknown radio message into
   space. Following the Battle of Corrin, Viceroy Faykan Butler renames
   himself Faykan Corrino in commemoration.
