   Alan Grant, Scotland Yard Inspector (a character who also appears in
   five other novels by the same author) is feeling bored while confined
   to bed in hospital with a broken leg. Marta Hallard, an actress friend
   of his, suggests that he should amuse himself by researching a
   historical mystery. She brings him some pictures of historical
   characters, aware of Grant's interest in human faces. He becomes
   intrigued by a portrait of King Richard III. He prides himself on being
   able to read a person's character from his appearance, and King Richard
   seems to him a gentle, kind and wise man. Why is everyone so sure that
   he was a cruel murderer?

   With the help of other friends and acquaintances, Grant investigates
   Richard's life and the case of the Princes in the Tower, testing out
   his theories on the doctors and nurses who attend to him. Grant spends
   weeks pondering historical information and documents with the help of
   Brent Carradine, a likable young American researcher working in the
   British Museum. Using his detective's logic, he comes to the conclusion
   that the claim of Richard being a murderer is a fabrication of Tudor
   propaganda, as is the popular image of the King as a monstrous
   hunchback.
