   From humble beginnings as an assistant in his immigrant father's cigar
   shop, Martin begins employment as a bellboy at the Vanderlyn hotel. He
   rises through its hierarchy through promotions, due to his reputation
   as a bright, conscientious worker. When he is offered the position of
   assistant manager, he quits to focus instead on managing a chain of
   restaurants. Later, he builds his own new concept for an extravagant
   hotel, the Hotel Dressler.

   He finds a friend and business partner in sister-in-law Emmeline
   Vernon, while his ambiguous, distant marriage to her withdrawn sister,
   Caroline, is a source of confusion and disappointment. A focus of the
   novel is Martin's imagination for grand, sweeping business ideas, and
   his instinctive sense for orchestrating large systems. Through all this
   Martin has the persistent feeling that there must be something bigger
   waiting around the next corner. One of the novel's themes is that
   emptiness may lie behind the ideal of the American Dream.
