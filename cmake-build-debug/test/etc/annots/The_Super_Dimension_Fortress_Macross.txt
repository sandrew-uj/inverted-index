   In 1999, a city-sized alien spacecraft crashes in South Ataria Island
   on Earth. Over the course of 10 years the military organization U.N.
   Spacy reverse-engineers its technology and rebuilds the spacecraft,
   naming it the SDF-1 Macross. In 2009 at the launch ceremony of the
   Macross, a young civilian pilot, Hikaru Ichijyo, comes to visit the
   Macross upon U.N. Spacy pilot Roy Focker's request. During the launch
   ceremony, a space war fleet from an alien race of humanoid giants
   arrives into the solar system and identifies the Macross as a former
   battleship used by their enemies, the Supervision Army. As the aliens,
   known as the Zentradi, approach the Macross, the original systems
   override the crew's commands and fire its main cannon, wiping out the
   advance alien scouts and starting a war. While Hikaru takes the new
   VF-1 Valkyrie on a test flight the aliens retaliate. He then encounters
   Lynn Minmay and rescues her from the aliens. The Macross crew attempts
   to use the experimental "Fold System" (Faster-than-light drives) to
   escape to the Moon's orbit, but instead it accidentally takes the
   Macross and South Ataria Island to the edge of the solar system. The
   people from the Macross salvage everything they can, including the city
   surrounding the ship and its civilians (who have survived in special
   safety shelters, which were transported along intact), and attach two
   aircraft carriers to the ship. Since the fold systems have vanished
   after the jump, the Macross is forced to make its way back to Earth by
   conventional power.

   The Zentradi suspect the humans might be their creators, the
   Protoculture. Under the command of Britai Kridanik and Exsedol Folmo,
   they plot ways to understand them. Fearful of their old combat
   directives of not interfering with Protoculture, the Zentradi perform
   attacks to test their theories about the people on board the Macross,
   and even have their Zentradi soldiers "micloned" (miniaturized) to
   learn more about their culture. The Zentradi capture several Macross
   personnel including Officer Misa Hayase and Hikaru to study. Boddole
   Zer, Supreme Commander of the Zentradi, is puzzled over things such as
   relationships amongst males and females. He confirms that the Miclones
   "are" protoculture during a demonstrated kiss between Hayase and
   Hikaru. After escaping, Hikaru and the others report their findings to
   their superiors, who have trouble accepting the reasons behind the
   Zentradi attacks as well as the huge forces the aliens possess.

   After much difficulty returning to Earth, the UN Spacy refuses to allow
   the Macross and the civilian passengers to return to land. Minmay's
   cousin, Lynn Kaifun, decides to join the Macross to see his parents and
   also look after Minmay. Because of Kaifun's relationship and constant
   contact with Minmay, the pair eventually enter a romantic relationship.
   After deliberation, the UN Spacy orders the Macross to leave Earth as a
   means to get the Zentradi away from them. During all these events, a
   female Zentradi ace fighter pilot, Milia Fallyna, is micloned and
   attempts to assassinate Maximilian Jenius, an ace UN Spacy pilot.
   Attempting to kill him during a knife duel, Milia is defeated and falls
   in love with Max, and the two are subsequently married. Their wedding
   aboard the Macross is broadcast to the Zentradi as a message that
   aliens and humans can co-exist. Since the Zentradi's exposure to
   culture and to Lynn Minmay's songs, some of them become eager to join
   the humans. Believing the "miclone contamination" is becoming a threat
   to all Zentradi forces, Boddole Zer orders his entire army to
   exterminate the human race and all those Zentradi previously exposed to
   human culture. Because Britai Kridanik was "contaminated" as well, he
   works with the humans to defeat the main Zentradi forces.

   The resulting battle culminates in the large scale devastation of
   Earth, but the people of the SDF-1 survive. After Boddole Zer is killed
   and his armada defeated, the surviving humans and their Zentradi allies
   begin rebuilding Earth.

   Two years after the end of the first Space War the transition into the
   Human ways becomes difficult to some Zentradi who can't stand the idea
   of a pacified life. Quamzin Kravshera constantly incites conflicts
   towards the civilians. He repairs a damaged Zentradi warship to return
   to his old ways and attacks the new Macross City built around the
   SDF-1. Moments before the final Zentradi attack, Misa Hayase tells
   Hikaru Ichijyo of her feelings for him and her decision to leave to
   space in a colonization mission to preserve human culture across the
   galaxy. Lynn Minmay, who was left by Kaifun and now loves Hikaru,
   doesn't want him to leave to join the fight. However, Hikaru still goes
   to defend the city anyway. Eventually Quamzin is killed. After a long
   emotional conflict Hikaru finally decides to be with Misa and join the
   colonization mission, but the two remain good friends with Minmay in
   the end.
