   In the mid-1960s, on Mother's Day, Robin, the eldest child and only son
   of the Dufresnes, a white family living in Mississippi, is found
   hanging from a tree on the family property. Only nine years old at the
   time of his death, Robin's murder causes his mother, Charlotte, to sink
   into a listless depression and his father, Dixon, to abandon the family
   on the pretext of work.

   Twelve years later Robin's two younger sisters, Allison and Harriet,
   are now sixteen and twelve years old, respectively. Harriet, the
   younger child, is considered particularly difficult as she is intensely
   smart but uncompromising. Harriet has developed a morbid fascination
   with her brother and with the past of her matrilineal family, the
   Cleves. Her great-grandfather, Judge Cleve, once owned the local
   mansion, "Tribulation", but lost the family's wealth in his declining
   years.

   Harriet's fascination with her brother's death leads her to decide to
   find the murderer with the reluctant help of her younger but devoted
   friend, a boy, Hely Hull. The Dufresnes' stalwart black maid, Ida Rhew,
   reveals that Robin had a fight with another boy shortly before his
   death. Harriet discovers that the boy is Danny Ratliff, the son of a
   highly dysfunctional local methamphetamine producing family. Farish
   Ratliff, an elder brother, runs the drug business with the help of
   Danny and the connivance of his grandmother, Gum. Farish, not a
   particularly intelligent man, is planning a drug shipment hidden within
   a truck transporting venomous snakes, which another brother, Eugene,
   uses to support his Evangelical preaching.

   Harriet believes that Danny is the murderer and resolves to exact
   revenge by stealing a cobra kept by Eugene, and dropping it into
   Danny's Trans Am vehicle. Harriet is also distraught at her parent's
   mean-spirited dismissal of the much loved Ida. After a near disastrous
   encounter with the Ratliffs when the brothers attempt to transport the
   drugs, Harriet and Hely manage to steal the cobra from Eugene's office.
   They proceed to drop the snake into the Trans Am from an abandoned road
   bridge but discover that the car was driven not by Danny but by their
   grandmother, Gum, who is severely bitten and hospitalized. The Ratliffs
   deduce that Harriet had been involved in the attack and seek her out
   after she returns early from summer camp following the death of her
   favourite great-aunt.

   Danny resolves to steal some of his own family's drugs and use them to
   buy his way out of town. Danny knows that drugs were hidden by his
   brother, after the failed shipment, in a water tower where they are
   also discovered by Harriet who throws them into the water. Farish
   becomes increasingly deranged by the consumption of his own product and
   violently forces Danny to take him for a drive. Danny drives towards
   the water tower where he fatally shoots Farish.

   After killing his brother, Danny discovers Harriet in the water tower
   and attempts to drown her. Harriet, who has been coincidentally
   practicing holding her breath, pretends to drown but is able to escape
   when the non-swimming Danny falls back into the water. Harriet climbs
   out of the tank, but the ladder collapses behind her leaving Danny to
   drown.

   Harriet's father, Dixon, visits her while she is recovering from her
   ordeal in hospital and reveals that Danny had in fact been Robin's
   "little friend" and was distraught when he heard of Robin's death. The
   authorities never discover Harriet and Hely's involvement with the
   Ratliffs, as her doctors consider her condition to be the result of an
   epileptic episode.

   However, Danny does not drown in the tank. Instead, he is arrested
   there and charged with his brother's murder.

   Ultimately, the novel ends with the identity of Robin's murderer
   remaining a mystery.
