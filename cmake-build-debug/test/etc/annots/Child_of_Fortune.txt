   The book is presented as an autobiographical tale, CHILD OF FORTUNE, A
   Historie of the Second Starfaring Age by Wendi Shasta Leonardo, and it
   includes an introduction written by the fictional narrator. Adolescents
   in the Second Starfaring Age are expected to embark on a journey of
   self-discovery called a wanderjahr, "the eternal journey from childhood
   to maturity through the wondrous and terrible chaos of the region
   between."^[3] The wanderers are known as "Children of Fortune", and
   their culture contains elements of the carnivalesque and 1960s flower
   Children.^[4]^[5] The wanderjahr is typically a fairly long journey
   that only ends when the wanderer adopts her adult name (her freenom)
   and chooses her life's work. Some never complete this rite of passage,
   and remain Children of Fortune their whole lives. The novel is the
   story of Wendi Shasta Leonardo's wanderjahr.

   The story begins when Wendi (known by her childhood name Moussa) leaves
   her home planet, Glade, with only a return ticket home, a small amount
   of spending money, and a sex-enhancing ring. She travels to the
   planet-sized city of Edoku, where she quickly burns through all her
   money and becomes a mendicant. She is adopted by a group of Children of
   Fortune known as the Gypsy Jokers. Moussa falls in love with the leader
   of the Gypsy Jokers, Pater Pan, who teaches her the art of ruespieling
   (story-telling) and gives her the name Sunshine.

   After the abrupt disappearance of Pater Pan, Sunshine leaves Edoku with
   a wealthy Child of Fortune named Guy Vlad Boca. They sample the
   hedonistic life of the Honored Passengers aboard the interstellar Void
   Ships and eventually arrive on the planet Belshazaar.

   On Belshazzar, there is a large forest known as the Bloomenwald, which
   is the source of a plethora of naturally occurring psychedelic drugs.
   The trees use intoxicants to induce mammals to perform pollination
   duties, and many Children of Fortune are trapped by the forest
   ecosystem. Through her force of will, Sunshine is able to lead a group
   back to reality. This becomes the basis for her first original
   composition as a ruespieler, "The Pied Piper of the Bloomenwald".

   Sunshine's tale attracts the attention of an author who convinces her
   to go find Pater Pan, so that the story will have an ending. Sunshine
   finds Pater Pan addicted to the Charge, a kind of electronic drug. As
   he is dying, she experiences his entire life story in a kind of
   ecstatic vision. Sunshine ends her wanderjahr and adopts the freenom
   Wendi.
