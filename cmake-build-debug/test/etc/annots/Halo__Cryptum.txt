   The Forerunner Saga is a trilogy of science fiction novels by Greg
   Bear, based on the Halo series of video games. The books in the series
   are Halo: Cryptum (2011), Primordium (2012), and Silentium (2013). The
   books were released in hardcover, e-book, paperback, and audiobook.
   Bear was given little restriction on the story of the novel; the Halo
   universe had not yet been explored in that time period.
