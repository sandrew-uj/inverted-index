   The Book of Lost Tales is a collection of early stories by English
   writer J. R. R. Tolkien, published as the first two volumes of
   Christopher Tolkien's 12-volume series The History of Middle-earth, in
   which he presents and analyses the manuscripts of those stories, which
   were the earliest form (begun in 1917) of the complex fictional myths
   that would eventually comprise The Silmarillion. Each of the Tales is
   followed by notes and a detailed commentary by Christopher Tolkien.^[1]

   For publication the book was split into two volumes: The Book of Lost
   Tales 1 (1983) and The Book of Lost Tales 2 (1984), but this is simply
   an editorial division. Both volumes are separated into several "Lost
   Tales".
