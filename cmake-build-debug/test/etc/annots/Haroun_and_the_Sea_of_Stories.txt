   At the beginning of the story, protagonist Haroun Khalifa lives with
   his father Rashid, a famous storyteller and doctor, and his mother
   Soraya, until the latter is seduced by their neighbor 'Mr. Sengupta' to
   leave home. Thereafter Rashid is hired to speak on behalf of local
   politicians but fails his initial assignment. The two are thence
   conveyed to the 'Valley of K' by courier 'Mr. Butt', to speak for
   'Snooty Buttoo', another politician. Attempting to sleep aboard
   Buttoo's yacht, Haroun discovers 'Iff the Water Genie', assigned to
   detach Rashid's imagination, and demands conversation against this
   decision with Iff's supervisor, the Walrus. They are then carried to
   the eponymous 'Sea of Stories' by an artificial intelligence in the
   form of a hoopoe, nicknamed 'Butt' after the courier. Of the Sea of
   Stories, Haroun learns it is endangered by antagonist 'Khattam-Shud,'
   who represents "the end".

   In the Kingdom of Gup, King Chattergy, Prince Bolo, General Kitab, and
   the Walrus announce their plans for war against the neighbouring
   kingdom of Chup, to recapture Bolo's betrothed Princess Batcheat.
   Rashid joins them here, having witnessed Batcheat's kidnapping.
   Thereafter Haroun and his companions join the Guppee army of 'Pages'
   toward Chup, where they befriend Mudra, Khattam-Shud's former
   second-in-command.

   Haroun, Iff, Butt the Hoopoe, and Mali the stories' gardener,
   investigating the Sea's 'Old Zone', are captured by Khattam-Shud's
   animated shadow, who plans to plug the Story Source at the bottom of
   the Sea. Before he can do so, Mali destroys the machines used by him to
   poison the Sea, and Haroun restores the Sea's long-annulled alternation
   of night and day- thus destroying the antagonist's shadow and those
   assisting him, and diverting the giant 'Plug' meant to seal the Source.
   In Chup, the Guppee army destroy the Chupwalas' army and release
   Princess Batcheat; whereupon Khattam-Shud himself is crushed beneath a
   collapsing statue commissioned by himself. Thereafter the Walrus
   promises Haroun a happy ending of his own story. On return to the human
   world, Rashid reveals Haroun's adventures to local citizens, who expel
   Snooty Buttoo.

   When Rashid and Haroun return home, the people of their city have
   become joyous to replace their customary misery, and Soraya has
   returned to her son and husband. The novel concludes with an appendix
   explaining the meaning of each major character's name.
