   The novel was adapted as a film in 1965, directed by Otto Preminger and
   starring Laurence Olivier, Carol Lynley, Keir Dullea, Martita Hunt and
   Noel Coward. The locale was changed from New York to London and the
   ending was changed.

   A remake was planned in 2007, to be directed by Joe Carnahan with Reese
   Witherspoon in the lead. The project collapsed when Witherspoon
   withdrew.

   A stage production, adapted by Ken Simon from the novel, played January
   4-14, 2012 at The Brick Theater in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
