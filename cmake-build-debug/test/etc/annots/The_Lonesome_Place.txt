   The Lonesome Place is told through the eyes of Steve, the narrator, and
   his best friend, Johnny Newell. The two boys are very scared of the
   dark and they believe that there is something living in the lonesome
   place. The lonesome place is an old grain elevator surrounded by tall
   trees and many piles of wood from the lumber yard that surrounds it.
   The story begins with the narrator's Mother asking her son to run
   errands for her before dinner at twilight. In order for the boy to get
   to the local grocery shop he needs to cross through the old lumber yard
   and past the lonesome place. At first sight, the lumber yard seems
   harmless enough, but after the sun goes down and the stars peep out
   into the sky the lumber yard becomes a place where shadows lurk and
   screams are drowned in darkness and never heard again. In the book it
   says Johnny and the narrator tend to run by the lonesome place when
   unable to avoid it because of the scary creature that they believe
   lives there. Both have their own hair-raising stories of going past the
   lumber yard and grain elevator at night. Johnny tells the narrator how
   the creature almost got him the night before, showing his ripped shirt
   as evidence of his close escape; the narrator returns with a tale of
   how he heard it knock over some lumber during his own trip through. The
   narrator has never seen the creature, but can feel its presence.

   When the boys run past the dark place their hearts race and their
   imagination runs wild. As they compare their experiences they conjure
   up a monster with big clawed feet, scales, a long tail and yet has no
   face. This creature waits for fearful children on which to prey. The
   creature is also able to climb the tree and lie in the trees. The
   creature also is known to lay by the lumber but the children can't see
   the creature because it's so dark in The Lonesome place.

   When the grain elevator is torn down and the boys are all grown up and
   become less fearful of the Lonesome Place, the monster waits for other
   fearful boys and girls in the dark. Many of the boys take their dates
   here because the lumber yard is so creepy for the girls. When Bobby
   Jeffers is killed by being mauled by some type of animal, the narrator
   and Johnny believe they are responsible for the boy's death, since they
   had left that conjured monster free to feed on another child's fear.
   They felt that they should have done something about it when they were
   younger. Now that Bobby is dead the boys feel guilt for creating the
   monster out of their own fears.
