   The story begins in 2065 in a post-apocalyptic American setting.
   Forty-three years earlier, in 2022, an alien race known as the Kurians
   triggered a series of natural disasters (as well as artificial ones)
   that enabled them to gain control of the planet and subjugate humanity.
   A plague has reduced the world population to 25% of its pre-cataclysm
   level; nuclear explosions have created a mild form of nuclear winter,
   cooling the Earth, and smaller events everywhere have added to the
   chaos. In America, the New Madrid fault let go, destroying much of the
   Midwest. Major rivers such as the Mississippi have been unleashed.
