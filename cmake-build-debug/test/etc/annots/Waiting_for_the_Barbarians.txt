   The story is narrated in the first person by the unnamed magistrate of
   a settlement that exists on the territorial frontier of "The Empire".
   The Magistrate's rather peaceful existence comes to an end with the
   Empire's declaration of a state of emergency and with the deployment of
   the Third Bureau--the special forces of the Empire--due to rumours that
   the area's indigenous people, called "barbarians" by the people in the
   settlement, might be preparing to attack the town. Consequently, the
   Third Bureau conducts an expedition into the land beyond the frontier.
   Led by the sinister Colonel Joll, the Third Bureau captures a number of
   barbarians, brings them back to town, tortures them, kills some of
   them, and leaves for the capital in order to prepare a larger campaign.

   In the meantime, the Magistrate begins to question the legitimacy of
   colonialism and personally nurses a barbarian girl who has been left
   crippled and partly blinded by the Third Bureau's torturers. The
   Magistrate has an intimate yet uncertain relationship with the girl.
   Eventually, he decides to take her back to her people. After a
   life-threatening trip through the barren land, during which they have
   sexual relations, he succeeds in returning her--finally asking, to no
   avail, if she will stay with him--and returns to his own town. The
   Third Bureau soldiers have reappeared there and now arrest the
   Magistrate for having deserted his post and for consorting with "The
   Enemy". Without much possibility of a trial during such emergency
   circumstances, the Magistrate remains in a locked cellar for an
   indefinite period, experiencing for the first time a near-complete lack
   of basic freedoms. He finally acquires a key that allows him to leave
   the makeshift jail, but finds that he has no place to escape to and
   spends most of his time outside the jail scavenging for scraps of food.

   Later, Colonel Joll triumphantly returns from the wilderness with
   several barbarian captives and makes a public spectacle of their
   torture. Although the crowd is encouraged to participate in their
   beatings, the Magistrate bursts onto the scene to stop it, but is
   subdued. Seizing the Magistrate, a group of soldiers hangs him up by
   his arms, deepening his understanding of colonialistic violence by a
   personal experience of torture. With the Magistrate's spirit clearly
   crushed, the soldiers mockingly let him roam freely through the town,
   knowing he has nowhere else to go. The soldiers, however, begin to flee
   the town as winter approaches and their campaign against the barbarians
   collapses. The Magistrate tries to confront Joll on his final return
   from the wild, but the colonel refuses to speak to him, hastily
   abandoning the town with the last of the soldiers. The predominant
   belief in the town is that the barbarians intend to invade soon, and
   although the soldiers and many civilians have now departed, the
   Magistrate helps encourage the remaining townspeople to continue their
   lives and to prepare for the winter. There is no sign of the barbarians
   by the time the season's first snow falls on the town.
