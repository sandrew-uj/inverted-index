   The novel is set in a dystopic Toronto, Ontario buffeted by a
   mysterious plague called sturnusemia, which is believed to be carried
   by starlings. Against this backdrop Lilah Kemp, a schizophrenic
   spiritualist "of intense but undisciplined powers", accidentally sets
   Kurtz free from page 92 of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and is
   forced to find a Marlow to defeat him.

   Kurtz becomes head of the Parkin Psychiatric Institute (based on the
   real Clarke Institute of Psychiatry) and travels among the city's
   elites, including a "Club of Men" which is in fact a child pornography
   ring. Marlow, meanwhile, is a staff psychiatrist at the Parkin.

   Although the reader is clearly meant to see the parallels between
   Findley's Kurtz and Marlow and Conrad's original characters, the book
   is deliberately ambiguous about whether Lilah Kemp has really performed
   this act of literary magic, or is merely crazy enough to think she has.
