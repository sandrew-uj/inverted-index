   Policeman Tom Campbell comes upon several men burgling a jewellery
   shop. Running to what appears to be a police box to call for backup, he
   enters Tardis, a time and space machine operated by its inventor Dr.
   Who, together with his niece Louise and granddaughter Susan, as they
   are about to depart for the future. Arriving in London in the year
   2150, they find a desolate landscape of ruined buildings. It transpires
   that the Daleks, who Dr. Who and Susan encountered in Dr. Who and the
   Daleks, have invaded Earth and ravaged the planet. Some of the
   survivors have formed a resistance movement, while those captured have
   either been turned into brainwashed slaves called Robomen, or taken to
   provide forced labour at a Dalek mining complex in Bedfordshire.

   Dr. Who and Tom become separated from Louise and Susan, are captured by
   a squad of Robomen and imprisoned on a Dalek spaceship. Dr. Who manages
   to release the cell's lock, unaware that the Daleks use escape attempts
   to test their captives' suitability for robotisation. Meanwhile, a man
   called Wyler takes Louise and Susan to a resistance base in a London
   Underground station, where they meet other rebels including David and
   the wheelchair-bound Dortmun. Dortmun suggests disguising some rebels
   as Robomen to get onto the Dalek spaceship and using bombs to attack it
   from inside.

   On the spaceship, Dr. Who and Tom are recaptured and taken to be
   robotised when the rebels, including David, Wyler and Louise, attack
   it. During the battle, Dr. Who and Tom free themselves. Dr. Who escapes
   with David, while Tom and Louise become trapped on the spaceship. After
   the attack fails, Wyler returns to the base where Dortmun and Susan are
   waiting and tells them that he saw Dr. Who escape. They decide to go to
   the outskirts of London and hide there until the rebels can regroup.
   Susan leaves a written message about their intentions for Dr. Who, then
   they depart and commandeer a van. Dortmun is killed when they encounter
   a Dalek patrol, however, and Wyler and Susan are forced to abandon the
   vehicle just before it is destroyed.

   After escaping from the spaceship, Dr. Who and David evade the Daleks
   and return to the now deserted underground station. Failing to see the
   message left for them, they assume that Wyler, Dortmun and Susan have
   gone to Bedfordshire to investigate the mining operation and decide to
   follow them.

   Hiding on the Dalek spaceship, which has taken off bound for the
   Bedford mine, Tom and Louise are reunited. When the craft lands they
   exit it through a waste chute. Finding themselves in the mining
   complex, they are attacked by a Roboman but saved by one of the
   slave-workers, who hides the couple in a tool shed.

   Wyler and Susan shelter in a cottage, occupied by a woman and her
   mother. Susan convinces Wyler that Dr. Who would avoid the Daleks they
   have seen in the Watford area, head for the Bedfordshire mine instead,
   and that they must go there too. The daughter then leaves on an errand,
   but returns with Daleks who capture Wyler and Susan and take them to
   their mine control centre.

   Near the mine Dr. Who and David are confronted by Brockley, a black
   marketeer, who agrees to smuggle them into the complex. By chance, he
   leads them to the tool shed where Tom and Louise are hiding. Reunited,
   they are joined by a prisoner, Conway. He reveals that the Daleks are
   about to drop a bomb into their mineshaft to destroy the Earth's core.
   This will then be replaced with a device enabling the aliens to pilot
   the planet like a giant spacecraft. Plans of the mine show an old shaft
   leading to a convergence between the planet's magnetic poles. Realising
   that an explosion at this point would release enough energy to draw the
   metallic Daleks into the Earth's core, Dr. Who asks Tom and Conway to
   attempt to deflect the bomb. Brockley also leaves, declining to get
   involved, and Dr. Who sends Louise and David to help get the prisoners
   away from the mine. Brockley then betrays Dr. Who, leading a group of
   Daleks to him. As Dr. Who is led away the Daleks open fire on Brockley,
   killing him.

   As Tom and Conway work in the mineshaft to alter the bomb's trajectory,
   they are discovered by a Roboman. During the ensuing fight Conway and
   the Roboman fall to their deaths. Tom uses timbers boarding up the old
   shaft entrance to create a deflecting ramp, then rushes back the
   surface.

   Dr. Who is taken to the mine control room and meets Wyler and Susan. He
   seizes the radio link to the Robomen and orders them to turn against
   their masters. As the Robomen fight the Daleks, Dr. Who escapes with
   Wyler and Susan while the slave workers flee from the mine. The Daleks
   quickly defeat the rebellion and release their bomb into the shaft, but
   the device is deflected and detonates at the pole convergence. The
   Daleks are pulled into the Earth's core and destroyed while their
   spaceship, having just taken off, is brought crashing down onto the
   mine and explodes.

   Later, as the travellers prepare to return to the present in Tardis,
   Tom asks to be taken back to a few minutes before the burglary
   occurred. Upon arrival he knocks out the thieves and then drives them
   away in their getaway car, heading for the police station and an
   anticipated promotion.
