   Jerome Branch Corbell has incurable cancer and is cryogenically frozen
   in the year 1970 in the faint hope of a future cure. His body is
   revived in 2190 by an oppressive, totalitarian global government called
   "The State". His personality and memories are extracted (destroying his
   body in the process) and transferred into the body of a mindwiped
   criminal. After awakening, he is continually evaluated by Peerssa, a
   "checker", who has to decide whether he is worth keeping. With the
   threat of his own mindwiping looming, Corbell works hard to pass the
   various tests.

   Peerssa decides that Corbell is a loner and born tourist, making him an
   ideal candidate to pilot a one-man Bussard ramjet, finding and seeding
   suitable planets as the first step to terraforming them. Discovering it
   is a one-way trip and disgusted with the State's treatment of him as an
   expendable commodity, Corbell hijacks the ship and takes it to the
   center of the galaxy. (It was at this point that the original short
   story ended.)

   Peerssa fails to talk him out of it. Peerssa and The State resort to
   subterfuge; an artificial intelligence program based on Peerssa's
   personality is secretly transferred into the ship's computer using the
   link with Earth. Though the Peerssa AI opposes the detour, it cannot
   disobey Corbell's direct orders.

   After a lengthy journey (including a close approach to the
   super-massive black hole at the galactic axis), possible only due to
   the suspended animation devices on board, Corbell returns to the solar
   system. Although only about 150 years have passed on the ship, three
   million years have elapsed on Earth, due to relativistic time dilation.
   At first, he is confused and initially believes they might have come to
   the wrong system because it has changed considerably; the Sun has
   apparently evolved into a red giant and what might be Earth is in orbit
   around a super-hot Jupiter. Having followed a message clearly from
   humans (warning not to visit other human-occupied star systems), and
   being too old to survive going anywhere else, Corbell puts the ship
   into orbit around what is surely the Earth.

   The Earth's climate has changed, especially its surface temperature;
   the poles are now temperate, while the former temperate zones reach
   temperatures of over 50 degrees Celsius (120+ degrees Fahrenheit). The
   Earth's axial tilt is still 23.5 degrees so the poles experience 6
   years of night and 6 years of day. Almost all remaining life on Earth
   has adapted to live in Antarctica. Elsewhere life is extinct except for
   some evidence of biological activity in the Himalayan mountains.

   When Corbell lands (in a modified biological probe), he is captured by
   Mirelly-Lyra, who is also a returned star ship pilot and refugee from
   the past--though from Corbell's (and Peerssa's) future. She explains
   that the human species has fragmented; it is dominated by a race of
   immortal, permanently pre-adolescent males (the Boys), who are created
   by advanced medical techniques. Some time in the past, they had
   defeated the equally immortal (though now extinct) Girls, in the
   ultimate war of the sexes. The Boys have enslaved the dikta, who are
   unmodified humans (though they have evolved somewhat), from whom they
   take boys to replenish their ranks.

   Mirelly-Lyra had initially been a captive toy of the Girls. After their
   downfall, she obsessively searched in vain for the lost
   adult-immortality treatment, extending her life as much as possible
   using her own drugs and a form of zero-time stasis while waiting for
   another returning star ship and potential help. Because she could not
   stop the aging process entirely, she is an old crone by the time she
   finds Corbell. He manages to escape from her, only to be caught by the
   Boys, who take him to a dikta settlement. Corbell finds out that the
   solar system was engineered into its new configuration by the Girls in
   order to move the Earth to a habitable distance from the enlarged Sun
   (caused by war with colonies), and that an orbital error caused Jupiter
   to overheat and triggered the war that killed the Girls. With Gording,
   the dikta leader, Corbell escapes once more.

   Eventually, Corbell discovers the adult-immortality treatment, albeit
   by accident and only realizing it after he himself has been exposed to
   it. He uses it to enlist Mirelly-Lyra's help, which in turn finally
   gives him full control of his ship's technology (the hostile Peerssa
   has decided that the woman is the last survivor of the State and will
   only obey her). The planet Uranus has been discovered to have been
   maneuvered to pass by the Earth and adjust its orbit by Peerssa the AI.
   Corbell arranges for the Earth's distance from the super-heated Jupiter
   to be adjusted by Peersa to lower the Earth's temperature without
   destroying the plants and animals that have adapted to the extreme
   conditions.

   As the novel closes, he is plotting to liberate the dikta and enable
   them to regain control of their own destiny.
