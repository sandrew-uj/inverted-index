   The book centres on a boy, Bastian Balthazar Bux, an overweight and
   strange child who is neglected by his father after the death of
   Bastian's mother. While escaping from some bullies, Bastian bursts into
   the antiquarian book store of Carl Conrad Coreander, where he finds his
   interest held by a book called The Neverending Story. Unable to resist,
   he steals the book and hides in his school's attic, where he begins to
   read.

   The story Bastian reads is set in the magical land of Fantastica, a
   place of wonder ruled by the benevolent and mysterious Childlike
   Empress. A great delegation has come to the Empress to seek her help
   against a formless entity called "The Nothing". The delegates are
   shocked when the Empress's physician, a centaur named Cairon, informs
   them that the Empress is ill, and has chosen a boy warrior named Atreyu
   to find a cure. Upon finding Atreyu, Cairon gives him AURYN: a powerful
   medallion that protects him from all harm. At the advice of the giant
   turtle Morla the Aged One, Atreyu sets off in search of an invisible
   oracle known as Uyulala, who may know the Empress's cure. In reaching
   her, he is aided by a luckdragon named Falkor, whom he rescues from the
   creature Ygramul the Many. By Uyulala, he is told the only thing that
   can save the Empress is a new name given to her by a human, who can
   only be found beyond Fantastica's borders.

   As Falkor and Atreyu search for the borders of Fantastica, Atreyu is
   flung from Falkor's back in a confrontation with the four Wind Giants
   and loses Auryn in the sea. Atreyu lands in the ruins of Spook City,
   the home of various creatures of darkness. Wandering the dangerous
   city, Atreyu finds the wolf Gmork, chained and near death, who tells
   him that all the residents of the city have leapt voluntarily into The
   Nothing. There, thanks to the irresistible pull of the destructive
   phenomenon, the Fantasticans are becoming lies in the human world. The
   wolf also reveals that he is a servant of the force behind The Nothing
   and was sent to prevent the Empress's chosen hero from saving her.
   Gmork then reveals that when the princess of the city discovered his
   treachery against the Empress, she imprisoned him and left him to
   starve to death. When Atreyu announces that he is the hero Gmork has
   sought, the wolf laughs and succumbs to death. However, upon being
   approached, Gmork's body instinctively seizes Atreyu's leg in his jaws,
   preventing him from being dragged by the Nothing. Meanwhile, Falkor
   retrieves Auryn from the sea and arrives in time to save Atreyu from
   the rapid approach of The Nothing.

   Falkor and Atreyu go to the Childlike Empress, who assures them they
   have brought her rescuer to her; Bastian suspects that the Empress
   means him, but cannot bring himself to believe it. When Bastian refuses
   to speak the new name, to prompt him into fulfilling his role as
   savior, the Empress herself locates the Old Man of Wandering Mountain,
   who possesses a book also entitled The Neverending Story, which the
   Empress demands he read aloud. As he begins, Bastian is amazed to find
   the book he is reading is repeating itself, beginning once again
   whenever the Empress reaches the Old Man -- only this time, the story
   includes Bastian's meeting with Coreander, his theft of the book, and
   all his actions in the attic. Realizing that the story will repeat
   itself forever without his intervention, Bastian names the Empress
   "Moon Child", and appears with her in Fantastica, where he restores its
   existence through his own imagination. The Empress has also given him
   AURYN, on the back of which he finds the inscription DO WHAT YOU WISH.

   For each wish, Bastian loses a memory of his life as a human. Unaware
   of this at first, Bastian goes through Fantastica, having adventures
   and telling stories, while losing his memories. In spite of the
   warnings of Atreyu and Bastian's other friends, Bastian uses AURYN to
   create creatures and dangers for himself to conquer, which causes some
   negative side effects for the rest of Fantastica. After being abetted
   by the wicked sorceress Xayide, and with the mysterious absence of the
   Childlike Empress, Bastian decides to take over Fantastica as Emperor.
   During his coronation ceremony he is stopped by Atreyu, whom Bastian
   grievously wounds in battle. Bastian then enters "Old Emperor City",
   inhabited by human beings who came to Fantastica earlier but could not
   find their way out, eking out a meaningless existence there.
   Ultimately, a repentant Bastian is reduced to two memories: that of his
   father, and of his own name. After more adventures, Bastian must give
   up the memory of his father to discover that his strongest wish is to
   be capable of love and to give love to others.

   After much searching, and on the verge of losing his final memory,
   Bastian is unable to find the Water of Life with which to leave
   Fantastica with his memories. Here, he is found by Atreyu. In remorse,
   Bastian lays down AURYN at his friend's feet, and Atreyu and Falkor
   enter AURYN with him, where the Water of Life demands to know Bastian's
   name, and if Bastian has finished all the stories he began in his
   journey, which he has not. Only after Atreyu gives Bastian's name and
   promises to complete all the stories for him does the Water of Life
   allow Bastian to return to the human world, along with some of the
   mystical waters. After drinking the Water of Life, Bastian returns to
   his original form, and feels comfortable and happy with it. He wanted
   to bring the water also to his father. He returns to his father, where
   he tells the full tale of his adventures, and thus reconciles with him.
   Afterwards, Bastian confesses to Coreander about stealing his book and
   losing it, but Coreander denies ever owning such a book. Coreander
   reveals he has also been to Fantastica, and that the book has likely
   moved into the hands of someone else and that Bastian--like
   Coreander--will eventually show that individual the way to Fantastica.
   This, the book concludes, "is another story and shall be told another
   time".
