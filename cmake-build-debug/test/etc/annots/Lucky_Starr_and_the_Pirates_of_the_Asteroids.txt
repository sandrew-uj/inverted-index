   A year has passed since the events in David Starr, Space Ranger. In
   that time the spaceship TSS Waltham Zachary has been taken and gutted
   by pirates based in the asteroid belt. Because David "Lucky" Starr
   harbors a personal dislike of the pirates for their murder of his
   parents, he has devised a plan whereby the unmanned survey ship Atlas,
   as soon as the pirates capture it and bring it to their hidden base,
   will explode. Unknown to anyone, Starr has leaked the plan to the
   pirates and sneaked aboard the ship, believing an infiltration will be
   a more efficient way to bring down the pirates.

   When captured, Starr tells the pirate leader, Captain Anton, that his
   name is Williams (his alias from David Starr, Space Ranger), and offers
   to join the pirates; whereupon Anton has Starr fight a duel in open
   space to prove himself worthy. Starr wins the duel, but remains a
   prisoner aboard Atlas while it is brought to an anonymous asteroid.

   The asteroid is home to a hermit named Joseph Patrick Hansen, and the
   pirates leave Starr in Hansen's care. Hansen tells Starr that he
   purchased the asteroid as a vacation site, and gradually made it more
   comfortable over the years, but now depends on the pirates for
   supplies, and later recognizes the pretended "Williams" as Lawrence
   Starr's son. Starr admits his true identity, and Hansen convinces him
   to pilot them to Ceres.

   On Ceres, Starr plans to send his friend Bigman to infiltrate the
   pirates, but realizes that Hansen's asteroid is not where it should be.
   Starr and Bigman take their own spaceship Shooting Starr to search for
   it and eventually land on its surface, where Starr is captured by
   Dingo, the pirate he beat in the duel. Dingo takes him inside the
   asteroid, revealing a hyperatomic engine used to move it. A fight with
   Dingo ends when Starr is struck with a neuronic whip and loses
   consciousness.

   Starr wakes to find himself in a spacesuit on the surface of the
   asteroid; whereupon Dingo straps him to a catapult and flings him into
   space. He uses his oxygen reserve to reverse his course and return to
   the asteroid, where he and Bigman defeat some of the pirates. As they
   leave the pirates' asteroid, they learn that a pirate fleet is
   attacking Ceres.

   Returning to Ceres, Starr realizes that the pirates' real object was to
   capture Hansen, which they have accomplished, and learns that Captain
   Anton's ship is taking Hansen to a secret Sirian base on Ganymede,
   whence the Sirians plan to attack Earth while Earth's fleet is occupied
   fighting the pirates in the Asteroid Belt. Although Anton has a 12-hour
   head start, Starr passes him to Ganymede by skimming the Shooting Starr
   past the Sun, wearing the Martian "Space Ranger" mask to ward off the
   heat and radiation.

   When Anton makes for Ganymede, Starr threatens to ram his ship, and
   accelerates toward it, all the while talking to Anton. The ships are
   ten miles apart when Hansen kills Anton and orders Anton's crew to
   surrender to Starr.

   When the Terran fleet arrives to take custody of the pirate ship, Starr
   convinces the commanding admiral to concentrate on the asteroid pirates
   and leave the Sirian base on Ganymede alone, revealing that Hansen is
   the leader of the asteroid pirates. It is then revealed that while
   Starr was intercepting Anton's ship, the Council of Science, on Starr's
   orders, captured the base and achieved the wherewithal to terminate the
   asteroid piracy. Hansen is coerced to have the Sirians leave Ganymede,
   and is sent to incarceration on Mercury. Afterwards, Starr reveals that
   the matter between him and Hansen was not just about the latter being
   the pirate mastermind, but a far more personal one. Hansen claimed to
   have met David's father, but didn't recognize his two close friends
   (despite the three being all but inseparable), and claimed that David
   resembles his father the most when he is angry, despite Lawrence hardly
   ever being in that state. From that, David states that within an hour
   after meeting Hansen, he knew he was facing not his father's
   acquaintance, but his parents' murderer.
