   In a Galway bookshop, Pidge buys a book called A Book of Patrick's
   Writing and accidentally frees an evil serpent, Olc-Glas, from inside
   it. Pidge and his five-year-old sister, Brigit, are then caught up in a
   battle between good (the Dagda) and evil (the Morrigan). Talking
   animals and other figures from Celtic mythology help them, and they
   travel to Tir na nOg.^[1]^[2]
