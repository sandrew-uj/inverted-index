   A Case of Conscience is a science fiction novel by American writer
   James Blish, first published in 1958. It is the story of a Jesuit who
   investigates an alien race that has no religion yet has a perfect,
   innate sense of morality, a situation which conflicts with Catholic
   teaching. The story was originally published as a novella in 1953, and
   later extended to novel-length, of which the first part is the original
   novella. The novel is the first part of Blish's thematic After Such
   Knowledge trilogy and was followed by Doctor Mirabilis and both Black
   Easter and The Day After Judgment (two novellas that Blish viewed as
   together forming the third volume of the trilogy).
