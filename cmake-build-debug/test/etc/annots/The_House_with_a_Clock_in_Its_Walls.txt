   Lewis Barnavelt, recently an orphan, moves to the town of New Zebedee,
   Michigan, to live with his mysterious uncle Jonathan Barnavelt. Lewis'
   uncle turns out to be a mediocre, though well-intentioned, warlock. His
   next-door neighbor and good friend, Florence Zimmermann, is a far more
   powerful good witch. Jonathan's house was previously owned by Isaac and
   Selenna Izard, a sinister couple who had dedicated their lives to black
   magic, and plotted to bring about the end of the world. Before dying,
   Isaac constructed the eponymous clock that he hid somewhere inside the
   walls of the house, where it eternally ticks as it attempts to pull the
   world into the magical alignment, which would permit him to destroy it.

   Lewis befriends a local boy named Tarby Corrigan, who is everything he
   is not--popular, athletic, thin--but the two soon begin to drift apart.
   Lewis tries to win Tarby back by demonstrating how to raise the dead in
   the local cemetery on Halloween but in doing so unwittingly releases
   Selena Izard from her tomb. An escalating series of encounters with the
   sorceress' ghost builds to a final confrontation in the basement of
   Jonathan's house, where Lewis must summon up his courage and prevent
   the couple from finishing their work and bringing about the end time.
