   The story starts off in the aftermath of a particle accelerator
   experiment. Somehow the experiment has opened some sort of
   interdimensional rift allowing demons to possess the dead. As the dead
   come back to life, a zombie plague results.

   The story's protagonist is Jim Thurmond, a construction worker living
   in West Virginia. Hiding away in a bomb shelter, which was previously
   constructed because of a fear of the aftermath of Y2K, Thurmond holds
   off packs of roving zombies, many of which were his neighbors and one
   of which is his recently deceased second wife who was pregnant. A
   distraught Jim laments his situation and worries about his son, Danny,
   who is living with Jim's first wife in upstate New Jersey. Jim
   considers suicide when unexpectedly Jim's cellphone rings with a
   message from his son, Danny. Danny whispers into the phone that he is
   hiding from the zombies in his mother's attic. Jim's suicidal thoughts
   turn around into a new purpose - to rescue Danny. Jim packs some
   supplies from the shelter and heads out into an apocalyptic United
   States overrun with gruesome sights. Jim fights his way out of the
   shelter by killing his undead neighbors and even his undead second
   wife, who taunts him with his unborn daughter. The moment he leaves the
   shelter, Jim is on the run discovering that the undead possess the
   ability to think, drive cars, use weapons, and set traps for the
   living.

   Meanwhile, a scientist named Baker, who was working on the particle
   accelerator, is trapped within the confines of his underground
   workspace. Baker feels as if he is directly responsible for the zombie
   plague, believing that his experiment is what allowed the demons
   through to the human world. An old colleague is trapped inside a room,
   a member of the undead who refers to himself as Ob. The zombie named Ob
   explains that he comes from somewhere called The Void, which seems to
   be "Hell." He learns that the zombies are not occupied by their
   original selves but instead a different evil entity with access to the
   host body's memories. Baker eventually escapes and finds his life being
   saved by Worm, a deaf young man whom the grateful Baker takes under his
   wing.

   raises more questions than answers. The story is continued in the
   sequel, City of the Dead.
