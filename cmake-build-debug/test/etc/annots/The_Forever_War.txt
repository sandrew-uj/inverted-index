   William Mandella is a physics student conscripted for an elite task
   force in the United Nations Exploratory Force being assembled for a war
   against the Taurans, an alien species discovered when they apparently
   attacked human colonists' ships. The UNEF ground troops are sent out
   for reconnaissance and revenge. The elite recruits have IQs of 150 and
   above, are highly educated, healthy, and fit. Training is grueling -
   first on Earth and later on a planet called "Charon" beyond Pluto
   (written before the discovery of the actual planetoid). Several of the
   recruits die during training due to the extreme environments and the
   use of live weapons. The new soldiers complete training and immediately
   depart for action via interconnected "collapsars" that allow ships to
   cover thousands of light-years in a split second. Traveling to
   collapsars at near-lightspeed has enormous relativistic time effects.

   Their first encounter with Taurans, on a planet orbiting Epsilon
   Aurigae, triggers their post-hypnotic training, which causes them to
   massacre the Taurans despite their lack of resistance. This first
   expedition, beginning in 1997, lasts only two years from the soldiers'
   point of view, but due to time dilation, they return to Earth in
   2024.^[4] During the expedition's second battle, the soldiers
   experience future shock first-hand, as the Taurans have much more
   advanced weaponry. Mandella, with fellow soldier and lover Marygay
   Potter, returns to civilian life, only to find humanity drastically
   changed. He and the other discharged soldiers have difficulty fitting
   into a society that has altered almost beyond their comprehension. The
   veterans learn that, to curb overpopulation, which led to class wars
   around the world caused by inequitable rationing, homosexuality has
   become officially encouraged by many of the world's nations. The world
   has become a very dangerous place due to mass unemployment and the easy
   availability of weapons. Alienated, Mandella and many other veterans
   re-enlist, despite the extremely high casualty rate and their
   recognition that the military is a soulless construct. Mandella and
   Potter receive promised postings as instructors on Luna, but upon
   arrival are immediately reassigned to a combat command.

   Almost entirely through luck, Mandella survives four years of military
   service, while several centuries elapse in real time. He soon becomes
   the objectively oldest surviving soldier in the war, attaining high
   rank through seniority rather than ambition. He and Potter (who has
   remained his last link with the Earth of his youth) are eventually
   given different assignments, meaning that even if they both survive the
   war they will likely never meet again due to time dilation. After
   briefly contemplating suicide, Mandella assumes the post of commanding
   officer of a "strike force", commanding soldiers who speak a language
   largely unrecognizable to him, whose ethnicity is now nearly uniform
   ('vaguely Polynesian' in appearance) and who are exclusively
   homosexual. He is disliked by his soldiers because they have to learn
   21st century English to communicate with him and other senior staff and
   because he is heterosexual.

   Engaging in combat thousands of light years away from Earth, Mandella
   and his soldiers need to resort to medieval weapons to fight inside a
   stasis field which neutralizes all electromagnetic radiation in
   anything not covered with a protective coating. Upon return, the strike
   force learns this is the last battle of the war. Humanity has begun to
   clone itself, resulting in a new, collective species calling itself
   simply Man. Man is able to communicate with the Taurans, who are also
   clones. It is discovered that the war started due to a
   misunderstanding; the colony ships were lost to accidents and those on
   Earth with a vested interest in a new war used these disappearances as
   an excuse to begin the conflict. The futile, meaningless war, which had
   lasted for more than a thousand years, ends.

   Man has established several colonies of old-style, heterosexual humans,
   just in case the evolutionary change proves to be a mistake. Mandella
   travels to one of these colonies (named "Middle Finger" in the
   definitive version of the novel) where he is reunited with Potter, who
   had been discharged much earlier and had taken trips in space to use
   time dilation to age at a much slower rate, hoping for Mandella's
   return. The epilogue is a news item from the year 3143 announcing the
   birth of a "fine baby boy" to Marygay Potter-Mandella.
