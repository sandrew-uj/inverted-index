   Richard and Kahlan are finally married and are enjoying their wedding
   night back in the Spirit house in the Village of the Mud People. Soon,
   sudden and unexplainable deaths begin to occur, and Richard comes to
   the conclusion that when Kahlan called forth "the chimes" in order to
   save him, they remained free, causing havoc. Zedd sends Richard and
   Kahlan off to the Wizard's Keep in Aydindril to get a special bottle
   that contains a spell that will stop the threat.

   While en route, Richard, Kahlan, and their Mord-Sith protector Cara are
   sidetracked into dealing with the people of Anderith, who have a
   powerful weapon of mass destruction called the Dominie Dirtch. They
   find that the leadership of Anderith wishes to surrender to the
   Imperial Order rather than surrender to the D'Haran Empire. As Richard
   tries his best to convince the people of Anderith of the danger the
   Imperial Order poses, he becomes firmly convinced that the chimes are
   loose.
