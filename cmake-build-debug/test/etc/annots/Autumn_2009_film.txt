   After a viral outbreak kills 99% of the world's population, scattered
   survivors come together and attempt to deal with the collapse of
   civilization. They face a new threat when the dead begin to reanimate.
   Initially catatonic, the corpses slowly regain their senses, become
   increasingly sensitive to outside stimuli, and show signs of
   aggression. Eventually, the survivors must fortify themselves against
   attack and try to find a reason to survive.
