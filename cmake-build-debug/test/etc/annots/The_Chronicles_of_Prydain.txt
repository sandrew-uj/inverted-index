   The Chronicles of Prydain is a pentalogy of children's high fantasy
   Bildungsroman novels written by American author Lloyd Alexander and
   published by Henry Holt and Company. The series includes: The Book of
   Three (1964), The Black Cauldron (1965), The Castle of Llyr (1966),
   Taran Wanderer (1967), and The High King (1968). The second book earned
   a 1966 Newbery Honor and the final novel won the 1969 Newbery
   Medal.^[1]

   The five novels take place in Prydain, a fictional country ruled by a
   High King who oversees several minor kingdoms. The setting is based on
   Wales and inhabited by creatures and characters inspired by Welsh
   mythology and folklore. The Chronicles of Prydain series follows the
   protagonist Taran, a youth living on a farm who dreams of being a great
   hero but instead is made "Assistant Pig-Keeper" in the first book,
   entrusted with protecting Hen Wen, a white "oracular pig" magically
   empowered with clairvoyance. While attempting to care for the sow,
   Taran stumbles into a series of adventures wherein he helps protect his
   country of Prydain from different threats, chief among them the evil
   Arawn, whose forces include an undead army known as the Cauldron-Born.
   Throughout the stories, Taran's major companions are the enchantress
   Princess Eilonwy, the bard Fflewddur Fflam (a minor king who has left
   his kingdom), the wild beast-man Gurgi, and the dwarf Doli. The heroes
   frequently work alongside the Fair Folk (a society of elves and similar
   beings) and the warriors known as the Sons of Don. Along with various
   fights against forces of evil, the novels focus on Taran's journey of
   maturity, growing from a hot-tempered, impulsive boy to a knowledgeable
   and insightful adult.

   The books were accompanied by an illustrated short story book in 1965
   and another in 1967, followed by The Foundling and Other Tales of
   Prydain, a collection of six short stories published in 1973. The cover
   art for the novels and the interior art for the short story picture
   books was done by Evaline Ness. New illustrations for the 1973
   anthology were done by Margot Zemach. The first two novels of The
   Chronicles of Prydain were loosely adapted into the 1985 Disney film
   The Black Cauldron and led to a video game of the same name based on
   the film produced by Sierra Entertainment.
