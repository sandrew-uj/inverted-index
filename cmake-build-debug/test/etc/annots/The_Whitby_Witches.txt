   After the deaths of their parents, eight-year-old orphan Ben and his
   older sister, Jennet, have been pushed from foster home to foster home
   for the majority of their young lives. After they have lived at a
   dreary hostel for a few months, the mistress Mrs Rodice has the
   children hauled off to live in the seaside village of Whitby, with
   relish. Ben and Jennet do not get along as Ben possesses a sixth sense
   meaning that he can see the spirits of dead people, including his
   parents. Jennet does not share this gift and therefore assumes he is
   lying and deliberately causing trouble. It is Ben's uncanny ability to
   see the dead that has caused him and his sister to be shunted between
   homes, as the families fostering them are unnerved by Ben.

   Upon arrival in Whitby, the children are adopted by a kind and
   eccentric elderly spinster named Miss Alice Boston, a former university
   lecturer. She and the children take to each other almost immediately,
   despite the children being a little bemused by Miss Boston's (or Aunt
   Alice as they grew to call her) odd mannerisms and lifestyle. Miss
   Boston tells Ben the scary stories of Whitby much to his delight as he
   adores horror stories, but Jennet does not approve as she believes it
   will encourage his lies and his stories that he can see their dead
   parents.

   Miss Boston is friends with many of the elderly spinsters in the Whitby
   community. The widowed Mrs Prudence Joyster, whose late husband was in
   the army; the batty, cat-loving Miss Matilda Droon, Miss Edith Whethers
   the postmistress, and the wealthy and grossly obese Dora Banbury-Scott,
   twice the widow who refuses to grow old gracefully. Ben and Jennet
   settle into Whitby and Ben encounters the "Fisher Folk", or the
   "Aufwader" as they call themselves, a reclusive and mysterious tribe of
   humanoid dwarf-like beings who are unseen by all except those with the
   sixth sense. Ben meets Nelda Shrimp, the youngest of the diminishing
   tribe and her aunt, Hesper Gull. They tell them that their kind are
   forbidden to fraternise with humans as it has done nothing but cause
   grief in the past. But Nelda has a premonition that Ben is involved in
   the fate of their tribe.

   The Fisher Folk were once plentiful in centuries past, until the
   witch-doctor of the tribes, Oona, fell in love with a human fisherman
   and together they produced a half-breed child. Enraged with this act of
   violation the Lords of the Deep, spirit-lords of the oceans, killed the
   fisherman and Oona committed suicide. Cheated of revenge, the Lords of
   the Deep turned to the Fisher Folks and condemned all the mothers and
   their newborns to die in childbirth, meaning that the tribes would
   never prosper. Nelda's own mother fell victim to this terrible fate
   along with so many other female Aufwaders.

   Meanwhile, a newcomer in town, Mrs Rowena Cooper, opens up a new
   antiques shop, and begins making herself very popular with the Whitby
   residents, by donating large sums of money to charity and charming even
   the most disagreeable neighbours. After being invited to tea at Mrs
   Cooper's house, Miss Boston and Mrs Joyster are instantly suspicious;
   Mrs Cooper appears ditzy, childish and too friendly for their liking.
   However, she has managed to woo over Miss Whethers, Miss Droon and Mrs
   Banbury-Scott most of all, whom she practically force-feeds expensive
   chocolates. After they leave, Miss Boston and Mrs Joyster share their
   doubts about Mrs Cooper, and Mrs Joyster is certain she has seen her
   before, but cannot recall where or when. She returns to her seaside
   cottage and reads her late husband's journal. In its pages, she
   discovers a horrifying truth:

   Rowena Cooper is in fact an evil woman named Roslyn Crosier, who, along
   with her diabolical husband Nathan, tormented and tortured an African
   tribe, inflicting unspeakable cruelty on them using black magic. The
   journal briefly mentions a gigantic black dog which terrified the
   tribe. Overcome with fury, she confronts Cooper, who reveals the truth
   of her identity and mocks Prudence, who is killed on the way home when
   an enormous black dog attacks her.

   Ben discovers that Nelda fears for her missing father, especially as a
   corpse has been discovered and has been identified as her uncle, Silas,
   a fiendish member of the tribe, and Hesper's husband. Hesper and Nelda
   tell Ben that they are searching for the moon kelp, a magical plant
   stolen from the Lords of the Deep, and if returned, the Deep Ones will
   grant the wish of anyone who finds it. Hesper wants to use it to lift
   the curse from the tribe. Shortly after Prudence's death, a hand of
   glory is stolen from the museum, and Mrs Banbury-Scott's manor is
   seriously vandalized, yet she and her entire staff slept peacefully
   through the chaos. At Prudence's funeral, Mrs Banbury-Scott dies
   apparently of a heart attack, and has bequeathed her entire estate to
   Rowena.

   Ben and Nelda continue to hunt for the moon-kelp, but Nelda's family
   are outcast from the tribe when a murdered body is found, believed to
   be Hesper's evil husband, Silas. Nelda's missing father, Abe, is blamed
   for the crime. Meanwhile, Jennet stumbles upon a tragic, lonely nun
   named Sister Bridget, being tormented and threatened by Rowena.
