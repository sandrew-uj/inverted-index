   The Moviegoer tells the story of Jack "Binx" Bolling, a young
   stock-broker in postwar New Orleans. The decline of tradition in the
   Southern United States, the problems of his family and his traumatic
   experiences in the Korean War have left him alienated from his own
   life. He day-dreams constantly, has trouble engaging in lasting
   relationships, and finds more meaning and immediacy in movies and books
   than in his own routine life.

   The loose plot of the novel follows the Moviegoer himself, Binx
   Bolling, in desperate need of spiritual redemption. At Mardi Gras, he
   breaks out of his caged everyday life and launches himself on a
   journey, a quest, in a "search" for God. Without any mental compass or
   sense of direction he wanders the streets of New Orleans' French
   Quarter, and Chicago, and then travels the Gulf Coast, interacting with
   his surroundings as he goes. He has philosophical moments, reflecting
   on the people and things he encounters on the road. He is
   constantly challenged to define himself in relation to friends, family,
   sweet-hearts, and career despite his urge to remain vague and open to
   possibility.

   "What is the nature of the search? you ask. Really it is very simple;
   at least for a fellow like me. So simple that it is easily overlooked.
   The search is what anyone would undertake if he were not sunk in the
   everydayness of his own life."
