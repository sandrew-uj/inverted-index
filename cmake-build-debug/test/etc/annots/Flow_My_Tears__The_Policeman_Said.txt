   The novel is set in a dystopian version of 1988, following a Second
   Civil War which led to the collapse of the United States' democratic
   institutions. The National Guard ("nats") and US police force ("pols")
   reestablished social order through instituting a dictatorship, with a
   "Director" at the apex, and police marshals and generals as operational
   commanders in the field. Resistance to the regime is largely confined
   to university campuses, where radicalized former university students
   eke out a desperate existence in subterranean kibbutzim. Recreational
   drug use is widespread, and the age of consent has been lowered to
   twelve. The black population has almost been rendered extinct. Most
   commuting is undertaken by personal aircraft, allowing great distances
   to be covered in little time.

   The novel begins with the protagonist, Jason Taverner, a singer,
   hosting his weekly TV show which has an audience of 30 million viewers.
   His special guest is his girlfriend Heather Hart, also a singer. Both
   Hart and Taverner are "Sixes", members of an elite class of genetically
   engineered humans. While leaving the studio, Taverner is telephoned by
   a former lover, who asks him to pay her a visit. When Taverner arrives
   at her apartment, the former lover attacks him by throwing a parasitic
   life-form at him. Although he manages to remove most of the life-form,
   parts of it are left inside him. After being rescued by Hart, he is
   taken to a medical facility.

   Waking up the following day in a seedy hotel with no identification,
   Taverner becomes worried, as failure to produce identification at one
   of the numerous police checkpoints would lead to imprisonment in a
   forced labor camp. Through a succession of phone calls made from the
   hotel to colleagues and friends who now claim not to know him, Taverner
   establishes that he is no longer recognized by the outside world. He
   soon manages to bribe the hotel's clerk into taking him to Kathy
   Nelson, a forger of government documents. However, Kathy reveals that
   both she and the clerk are police informants, and that the lobby clerk
   has placed a microscopic tracking device on him. She promises not to
   turn Taverner over to the police on the condition that he spend the
   night with her. Although he attempts to escape, Kathy confronts him
   again after he has successfully passed a police checkpoint using the
   forged identity cards. Feeling in her debt, he accompanies Kathy to her
   apartment block, where Inspector McNulty, Kathy's police handler, is
   waiting. McNulty has located Taverner via the tracking device the hotel
   lobby clerk placed on him, and instructs Taverner to come with him to
   the 469th Precinct police station so that further biometric identity
   checks can be performed.

   At the station, McNulty erroneously reports the man's name as Jason
   Tavern, revealing the identity of a Wyoming diesel engine mechanic.
   During questioning, Taverner goes along with McNulty's mistake,
   explaining that he no longer resembles Tavern due to extensive plastic
   surgery. McNulty accepts this explanation and decides to release
   Taverner while lab checks are run on the rest of the documents. He
   issues Taverner a seven-day police pass to ensure he can pass police
   checkpoints in the interim period. Deciding to lie low, Taverner heads
   to a Las Vegas bar in the hopes of meeting a woman with whom he can
   stay. Instead, he encounters a former lover, Ruth Gomen; although she
   no longer recognizes him, he succeeds in his bid to seduce her and is
   taken back to her apartment. On the orders of Police General Felix
   Buckman, Gomen's apartment is raided and Taverner is taken into
   custody, being transported immediately to the Police Academy in Los
   Angeles.

   Buckman personally interrogates Taverner, soon reaching the conclusion
   that Taverner genuinely does not know why he no longer appears to
   exist. However, he suspects that Taverner may be part of a larger plot
   involving the Sixes. He orders Taverner released, although ensuring
   that tracking devices are again placed on him. Outside the police
   academy, Taverner is approached by Alys Buckman, Felix's hypersexual
   sister and lover. Alys removes the tracking devices from Taverner and
   invites him to the home she shares with her brother. On the way there,
   she tells Taverner that she knows he is a TV star and reveals copies of
   his records.

   At the Buckmans' home, Taverner takes Alys up on an offer of mescaline.
   When he has a bad reaction to the drug, Alys goes to find him a
   medicine to counteract it. When she does not return, Taverner goes to
   search for her, only to find her skeletal remains on the bathroom
   floor. Frightened and confused, he flees, unsuccessfully pursued by a
   private security guard. To aid in his escape, he asks for the help of
   Mary Anne Dominic, a potter. Heading to a cafe with her, they find that
   one of his records is on the jukebox. When his song plays, people begin
   to recognize him as a celebrity. After parting with Dominic, Taverner
   goes to the apartment of his celebrity girlfriend Heather Hart. She
   returns home, horrified, and shows Taverner a newspaper mentioning that
   he is wanted in connection with Alys Buckman's death, the motive
   believed to have been his jealousy over Alys' purported relationship
   with Hart.

   An autopsy reveals that Alys' death was caused by an experimental
   reality-warping drug called KR-3. The coroner explains to Felix that,
   as Alys was a fan of Taverner, her use of the drug caused Taverner to
   be transported to a parallel universe where he no longer existed. Her
   death then caused his return to his own universe. The Police General
   decides to implicate Taverner in Alys' death to distract attention from
   his incest. The press are informed that Taverner is a suspect in the
   case and, wishing to clear his name, Taverner surrenders himself to the
   police. Heartbroken over the death of his sister, Felix returns home,
   suffering a nervous breakdown on the way.

   In an epilogue, the final fates of the main characters are disclosed.
   Buckman retires to Borneo where he is assassinated soon after writing
   an expose of the global police apparatus. Taverner is cleared of all
   charges and dies of old age, while Heather Hart abandons her celebrity
   career and becomes a recluse. Dominic's pottery wins an international
   award and her works become of great value while she lives into her
   eighties. KR-3 test trials are deemed too destructive and the project
   is abandoned. Ultimately, the revolutionary students give up and
   voluntarily enter forced-labor camps. The detention camps later dwindle
   away and close down, the government no longer posing a threat.
