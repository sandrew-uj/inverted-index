   During the war against D'Hara, a young woman meets with Zeddicus Zu'l
   Zorander, Wizard of the First Order, so that she can force him to pay a
   debt of bones he owes her and save her child. In so doing, she
   initiates the series of events leading up to the end of the war with
   D'Hara and the division of the Westlands, Midlands, and D'Hara by the
   boundaries.
