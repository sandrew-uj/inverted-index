   A viral pandemic causes people to become violent and bestial.
   Twenty-five years later, young adult Anna and her brother, David,
   scavenge through the ruins of a nearby city. Spooked by the arrival of
   a ragged survivor, they flee back into the woods. David injures his
   ankle and urges Anna to leave him behind, believing their sick mother
   needs protection. Anna lies to her mother, assuring her that David will
   return shortly from a hunting trip. When Anna wakes the next morning,
   her mother is dead.

   While gathering water, another stranger follows her back to her shack
   and introduces himself as Peter. After he agrees to surrender his
   weapons, Anna invites him in. Impressed with her self-sufficiency and
   skill, Peter reveals that he comes from a nearby religious commune.
   Noting the shack's religious iconography, Peter asks if she is a
   believer. Excited to find she was raised Christian, he invites her to
   join the commune. Although she initially declines, Anna accompanies
   Peter after remembering her mother's last wish - that she join other
   survivors.

   On the way, Peter injures his leg in a trap. They bond further as Anna
   helps him. Peter explains that his parents either died or abandoned
   him, and the religious commune took him in. Encountering more ragged
   people, Peter explains they are Berserkers - pagans who worship the
   plague and act as if they are infected. Eventually, they come upon an
   old man at a campfire. Peter advises avoiding him, saying he may have
   set the trap. Anna frustrates Peter by hailing the old man. When they
   join him, his son comes out of hiding and disarms them. Anna angers
   Peter by inviting the men to the commune without consulting him. The
   old man says he has had bad dealings with the commune and pressures
   Anna to stay with them. Peter kills the men with a hidden knife, saying
   they would have raped Anna.

   Although upset at what she believes to be Peter's unnecessary violence,
   Anna reluctantly surrenders her weapons to the religious commune when
   they arrive. Before she can be officially inducted into their
   community, she finds that a prisoner is to be judged. It turns out to
   be the man who chased her and David through the woods earlier, and Anna
   accuses him of killing David. Ben, the head of security, wants to
   release the prisoner, but Peter and Zack, the religious leader, vote to
   kill him for his sins. Anna is surprised to learn she must be baptised
   despite being a Christian. The other women in the commune seem to
   consider it a sort of marriage ceremony, further worrying her. When she
   expresses misgivings to Ben, he warns her that such talk could result
   in being labeled a heretic.

   After the baptism, Peter forcefully kisses her. When Zack intimates
   that her duties include bearing children for the village elders,
   including Zack and Peter, Anna attempts to leave the commune. Peter
   stops her, saying God has given her to him. Ben interrupts them to warn
   that the Berserkers are massing for an attack. Peter, Ben, Anna, and
   several guards lead the prisoner out of the village, attempting to
   trade the prisoner's release for the commune's safety. Anna escapes
   when Berserkers attack them. She is stunned to find David among them.
   David hides her, and she watches as he executes Ben. The Berserker who
   was their prisoner attempts to punish David, upset that he let his
   sister escape. Anna returns to save David, but he refuses to leave the
   Berserkers, who he says have taught him to become strong.

   Confused, Anna leaves David behind, encountering Peter again. Peter
   points out that the commune has been razed, and he insists on starting
   a new one with Anna as his wife. When she refuses, he attempts to rape
   her. She kills him, and he forgives her with his last words. Back at
   the commune, Anna finds only one survivor - Judith, Zack's wife.
   Judith, who hid while the others were tortured, says the harsh world
   has changed everyone for the worse, but Anna says all involved have
   simply chosen to act immorally.
