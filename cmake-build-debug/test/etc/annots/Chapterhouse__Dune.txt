   The Bene Gesserit find themselves the target of the Honored Matres,
   whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are
   seeking to assimilate the technology and superhuman skills of the Bene
   Gesserit, and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Now in command of the
   Bene Gesserit, Mother Superior Darwi Odrade continues to develop her
   drastic, secret plan to overcome the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit
   are also terraforming the planet Chapterhouse to accommodate the
   all-important sandworms, whose native planet Dune had been destroyed by
   the Matres. Sheeana, in charge of the project, expects sandworms to
   appear soon. The Honored Matres have also destroyed the entire Bene
   Tleilax civilization, with Tleilaxu Master Scytale the only one of his
   kind left alive. In Bene Gesserit captivity, Scytale possesses the
   Tleilaxu secret of ghola production, which he has reluctantly traded
   for the Sisterhood's protection. The first ghola produced is that of
   their recently deceased military genius, Miles Teg. The Bene Gesserit
   have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: the latest Duncan Idaho
   ghola, and former Honored Matre Murbella, whom they have accepted as a
   novice despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the
   Honored Matres.

   Lampadas, a center for Bene Gesserit education, has been destroyed by
   the Honored Matres. The planet's Chancellor, Reverend Mother Lucilla,
   manages to escape carrying the shared-minds of millions of Reverend
   Mothers. Lucilla is forced to land on Gammu where she seeks refuge with
   an underground group of Jews. The Rabbi gives Lucilla sanctuary, but to
   save his people from the Matres he must deliver her to them. Before
   doing so, he reveals Rebecca, a "wild" Reverend Mother who has gained
   her Other Memory without Bene Gesserit training. Lucilla shares minds
   with Rebecca, who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back
   to the Sisterhood. Lucilla is then "betrayed", and taken before the
   Great Honored Matre Dama, who tries to persuade her to join the Honored
   Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. The
   Honored Matres are particularly interested in learning to voluntarily
   modify their body chemistry, a skill that atrophied among the Bene
   Gesserit who went out into the Scattering and evolved into the Honored
   Matres. From this, Lucilla deduces that the greater enemy that the
   Matres are fleeing from is making extensive use of biological warfare.
   Lucilla refuses to share this knowledge with the Matres, and Dama
   ultimately kills her.

   Back on Chapterhouse, Odrade confronts Duncan and forces him to admit
   that he is a Mentat, proving that he retains the memories of his many
   ghola lives. Meanwhile, Murbella collapses under the pressure of Bene
   Gesserit training, and realizes that she wants to be Bene Gesserit.
   Odrade believes that the Sisterhood made a mistake in fearing emotion,
   and that in order to evolve, they must learn to accept emotions.
   Murbella survives the spice agony and becomes a Reverend Mother. Odrade
   confronts Sheeana, discovering that Duncan and Sheeana have been allies
   for some time. Sheeana does not reveal that they have been considering
   the option of reawakening Teg's memory through imprinting, nor does
   Odrade discover that Sheeana has the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison.
   Teg is awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appoints
   him again as Bashar of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the
   assault on the Honored Matres. Odrade announces to the Bene Gesserit
   that Teg will lead an attack against the Honored Matres. She also makes
   clear her intention to share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana,
   making them candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior if she dies.
   Odrade meets with the Great Honored Matre while the Bene Gesserit
   forces under Teg attack Gammu with tremendous force. Teg uses his
   secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system, and
   victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In the midst of this
   battle, Rebecca and the Jews take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet.

   Dama's chief advisor Logno assassinates Dama with poison and assumes
   control of the Honored Matres. Too late, Odrade and Teg realize they
   have fallen into a trap, and the Honored Matres use a mysterious weapon
   to turn defeat into victory, and capture Odrade. Murbella saves as much
   of the Bene Gesserit force as she can and they withdraw to
   Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of
   the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last
   desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface,
   announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has
   managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives
   on the planet and is taken to the Great Honored Matre. Unable to
   control her anger, Logno attacks but is killed by Murbella. Awed by her
   physical prowess, the remaining Honored Matres are forced to accept her
   as their new leader. Odrade is also killed in the melee and Murbella
   shares with Odrade to absorb her newest memories, as they had already
   shared prior to the battle. Murbella's ascension to leadership is not
   accepted as victory by all the Bene Gesserit. Some flee Chapterhouse,
   notably Sheeana, who has a vision of her own, and arranges to have some
   of the new worms that have emerged in the Chapterhouse desert brought
   aboard the no-ship. Sheeana is joined by Duncan. The two escape in the
   giant no-ship, with Scytale, Teg and the Jews. Murbella recognizes
   their plan at the last minute, but is powerless to stop them.
