   The novel is set in West Germany and East Germany in the months of
   August and September; the year is unspecified.

   Team Yankee ("Y" in the ICAO and NATO phonetic alphabet) is an
   armor-heavy company-sized unit (a "Team" in Army parlance). There is
   nothing special about this team; it is an average company-sized U.S.
   unit in an average battalion of the Regular Army.

   Team Yankee is composed of First Platoon (Lieutenant Murray Weiss),
   Second Platoon (Second Lieutenant McAllister), Mech(anized Infantry)
   Platoon (Staff Sergeant Polgar), and Third Platoon (Second Lieutenant
   Gerry Garger). Captain Sean Bannon is company commander; First
   Lieutenant Robert Uleski is the executive officer; and company first
   sergeant is First Sergeant Raymond Harrert.

   Captain Bannon is 27 years old, married and has three children. He
   studied military history, with a graduate degree, but is seen as an
   average officer; Coyle notes in the preface that Bannon will probably
   never rise in rank above lieutenant colonel.

   The team has 4 M1 Abrams tanks per platoon numbered 11, 12, 13, 14,
   21... to 34, with the first digit corresponding to the respective
   platoon. The XO's tank is numbered 55; the CO's tank 66. Thus, the team
   has 10 M1s in the first twelve chapters when its First Platoon is
   attached to another unit.

   The team also has 5 M113 armored personnel carriers, and 2 M901 ITV TOW
   missile vehicles. The infantry is armed with Dragon antitank missiles
   and 66-millimeter LAWs. The Team also has a M113 AMEV (Armored Medical
   Evacuation Vehicle) and an M88 recovery vehicle.

   The parent unit of Team Yankee is the First Battalion, 4th Armor.
   During the first twelve chapters it is attached to Task Force 3-78
   Mechanized Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Reynolds. The
   brigade commander is Colonel Brunn.

   The task force is composed of Team Yankee, C Company (Captain Craven) a
   standard infantry company, D Company, and another armor-heavy Team
   Bravo. In addition, there is an artillery support team (a FIST) (Second
   Lieutenant Rodney Unger) attached.
