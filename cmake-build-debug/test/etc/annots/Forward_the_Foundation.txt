   Forward the Foundation continues the chronicles of the life of Hari
   Seldon, first begun in Prelude to Foundation. The story takes place on
   Trantor, and begins eight years after the events of Prelude to
   Foundation. It depicts how Seldon develops his theory of psychohistory
   from hypothetical concept to practical application, and its application
   in the Seldon plan.

   In the latter years of the reign of Emperor Cleon I, Seldon is dragged
   into the world of galactic politics by Yugo Amaryl's concern over
   Seldon's friend Eto Demerzel, known only to Seldon and Dors Venabili as
   R. Daneel Olivaw. Where a new political faction threatens to Demerzel,
   and consequently the fate of the Galactic Empire. In the aftermath
   Demerzel steps down as First Minister, vanishing to attend to other
   matters in the galaxy. Cleon appoints Seldon, somewhat unwilling, as
   the new First Minister. After a ten year period of relative silence on
   Trantor, the remains of the political faction exploit Trantor's faults
   in an attempted coup. As a result the Emperor is assassinated, and a
   military junta takes over for a disastrous decade. Seldon steps down
   from his government position and resumes leadership of the
   psychohistory project.

   Seldon and others, most notably Yugo Amaryl, finally develop
   psychohistory to the point that he can initiate what will come to be
   known as the Seldon Plan, the road map for drastically shortening the
   interregnum between the First and Second Empires.^[3]

   Gradually, Seldon loses all those who are close to him. Seldon's
   consort Dors is killed (or rather destroyed) in an internal plot by an
   ambitious member of Seldon's own group. His adopted son Raych emigrates
   with his wife and younger daughter to Santanni, though his elder
   daughter Wanda remains with Seldon. When a rebellion against the Empire
   breaks out, Raych sends his wife and younger daughter away on a
   starship, but he remains behind to defend his university and is killed,
   and the starship is never seen again. Yugo Amaryl, the second best
   psychohistory researcher (after Seldon himself), dies in middle age,
   worn out by his work. Except for his granddaughter Wanda, Seldon is
   alone in his fight to keep the project going in the face of the
   Galactic Empire's accelerating decline and lessening government
   support.

   Wanda turns out to be what Seldon calls a "mentalic": someone who can
   read minds and actually influence people. (Seldon suspects that her
   father Raych's great likeability is a subconscious use of the same
   power.) They are able to find a few other mentalics, enabling Seldon to
   set up a second guardian for the Seldon Plan. Eventually, he secludes
   Wanda and the others to establish the Second Foundation in secret,
   which later turns out to be at the same Imperial Library of Trantor.
   While the public First Foundation concentrates on the physical
   sciences, the hidden Second's psychohistorians will develop the mental
   ones by "scholars."
