   The series is set in an unnamed world that, due to the cyclical nature
   of time as depicted in the series, is simultaneously the distant past
   and the distant future Earth. The Randlands or The World of the Wheel
   are names adopted by fans to refer to the world where The Wheel of Time
   series takes place, and are derived from the name of the central
   character, as well as section of the companion book The World of Robert
   Jordan's The Wheel of Time.
