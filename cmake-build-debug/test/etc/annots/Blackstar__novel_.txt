   In a world blasted and barren, the last bastion of civilization is the
   fortress-city of Central. The people within its walls gladly accept the
   dominion of Kaine, the city's benevolent arbiter, in return for his
   gift to them - Re:memory. This public archive contains humanity's
   memories of the world before it was destroyed, allowing them to relive
   the lost glories of the past.

   Rezin doesn't know who he is or how he came to be in Central, but he
   does know this: he is a Reaper. His combination of gifts and abilities
   allow him to decrypt any system and steal information to sell to the
   highest bidder. His talents afford him a life of luxury until the day
   he plugs into Re:memory and reaps something he wasn't looking for,
   something he doesn't understand - and something that Kaine will do
   anything to retrieve.

   Forced to flee into the dangerous Outlands, Rezin must dodge Kaine's
   pursuing forces even as he finds that the secret he took from Re:memory
   is transforming him, awakening within him powers he can't control. When
   he encounters mysterious twins with powers of their own, Rezin begins a
   journey beyond the confines of the world he knew, a journey that will
   lead him across space and time, a journey that will bring him face to
   face with the nature of the universe - and of himself.^[8]
