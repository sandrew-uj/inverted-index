   The novel primarily follows the story of a white teenager and an
   African-American man on their journey down the devastated Mississippi
   River.

   Although the focus of the novel is the journey of the two main
   characters, there are dozens of side-stories and parallel plot lines
   throughout the book. Some of which are: a preacher who leads his flock
   to believe that the end has come, a Sheriff (and KKK member) who begins
   a program of genocide against the people left homeless by the disaster,
   a technician struggling to keep a Louisiana nuclear power plant from
   melting down, and an Army Corps of Engineers commander trying to
   curtail the devastation wrought by the failure of the levee system.

   The author also plays on actual historical events and personalities
   such as Huey Long, the uprising at the Sobibor concentration camp, and
   the Jonestown incident.
