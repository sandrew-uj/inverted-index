   The year is 1529, and Brian Duffy, a world-weary Irish mercenary
   soldier, is hired in Venice by the mysterious Aurelianus to go to
   Vienna and work as a bouncer at the Zimmerman Inn, former monastery and
   current brewery of the famous Herzwesten beer.

   Meanwhile, the Ottoman Turkish army under Sultan Suleiman I has
   achieved its most advanced position yet in their march into Europe, and
   is prepared to undertake the siege of Vienna. With the Turkish army
   travels the Grand Vizier Ibrahim, a magician who intends to use
   horrific spells as part of the siege.

   Duffy spent time in Vienna years ago, and as he returns, he is haunted
   by memories of past events, and also finds himself having visions of
   mythical creatures and being ambushed by shadowy people and demonic
   monsters.

   Upon arriving in Vienna, Duffy reconnects with Epiphany Vogel, a former
   girlfriend, and her father Gustav, who is working on a painting he
   calls "The Death of St. Michael the Archangel". It seems the painting
   is never quite complete, and the elder Vogel is continuously adding
   additional detail to the work, causing it to gradually become more and
   more obscure.

   Then Duffy finds himself not only drafted into the city's defensive
   army, but also led by Aurelianus down mystical paths from the
   surprisingly old brewery to even more ancient caves beneath the city,
   in search of defenses against the approaching army and clues to Duffy's
   very nature.

   As it turns out, Aurelianus knows more about Duffy and his past than
   Duffy himself knows, and his real purpose in hiring him is to protect
   the hidden Fisher King, secret spiritual leader of the western world,
   and to defend him and the West against the Turkish advance. And the
   real reason that Vienna must not be captured by the Turks is that it is
   the site of the Herzwesten brewery. Its light and bock beers are famous
   throughout Europe, but the dark beer, produced only every seven hundred
   years, has supernatural properties and must not be allowed to fall into
   enemy hands.

   Meanwhile, others are drawn to Vienna in anticipation of significant
   events. The so-called "dark birds", magically sensitive individuals
   from far flung corners of the world, arrive in the city hoping for a
   sip of the Herzwesten dark, and a small group of middle-aged Vikings
   have improbably sailed their ship down the Danube River to Vienna,
   having sensed that the prophesied final battle of Ragnarok will take
   place there.
