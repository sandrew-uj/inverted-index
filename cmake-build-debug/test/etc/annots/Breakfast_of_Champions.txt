   Breakfast of Champions tells the story of the events that lead up to
   the meeting of Kilgore Trout and Dwayne Hoover, the meeting itself, and
   the immediate aftermath. Trout is a struggling science fiction writer
   who, after their fateful meeting, becomes successful and wins a Nobel
   Prize; Hoover is a wealthy businessman who is going insane, sent over
   the brink by his encounter with Trout.

   Trout, who believes himself to be completely unknown as a writer,
   answers an invitation to appear at the Midland City arts festival.
   First he goes to New York City, where he is abducted and beaten up by a
   group of anonymous, faceless characters who through the media gain the
   moniker "The Pluto Gang." Trout hitches a ride first with a truck
   driver whose truck says PYRAMID on its side, with whom he discusses
   everything from politics to sex to the destruction of the planet. Then
   he hops a ride with the only clearly happy character in the book, the
   driver of a Ford Galaxie who works for himself as a traveling salesman.

   Hoover gradually becomes insane as the book progresses. He terrifies
   his employee at the Pontiac dealership, Harry LeSabre, by criticizing
   his clothes. LeSabre is afraid Hoover has discovered that he is a
   closeted transsexual. Hoover then gets into a fight with his mistress
   and secretary, Francine Pefko because he accuses her of asking him to
   buy her a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.

   Trout and Hoover meet in the cocktail lounge of the new Holiday Inn,
   where Hoover's homosexual and estranged son, Bunny, plays the piano.
   When the bartender turns on the black lights and Trout's white shirt
   glows brilliantly, Hoover is entranced by it. He accosts Trout and
   reads his novel, Now It Can Be Told. The premise of the novel is that
   there is only one creature with free will in the universe (the reader
   of the novel) and everyone else is a robot. Hoover interprets its
   message as addressed to him from the Creator of the Universe and goes
   on a violent rampage, injuring many people around him and ending up in
   a mental hospital.

   In the epilogue, Trout is released from the hospital after Hoover
   partly bit off his finger in the rampage, and is wandering back to the
   arts festival, which unbeknownst to him has been canceled. The
   narrator, who has become an interactive character in the universe of
   his own creation, watches Trout and then chases him down. He proves
   that he is the Creator of the Universe by sending Trout all around the
   world, through time and back. Then he returns to his own universe,
   presumably, through the "void," while Trout yells after him, "Make me
   young!"
