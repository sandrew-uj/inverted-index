   Derace Kingsley, a wealthy businessman, hires Marlowe to find his
   estranged wife, Crystal. Kingsley had received a telegram from Crystal
   about two weeks before stating that she was divorcing him and marrying
   her gigolo boyfriend, Chris Lavery. But when Kingsley ran into him,
   Lavery had claimed that he hadn't seen her and didn't know where she
   was.

   Marlowe begins his investigation with a visit to Lavery in the
   neighbouring town of Bay City. But while watching Lavery's house,
   Marlowe is threatened by the tough cop Al Degarmo, who suspects him of
   harassing Lavery's neighbour, Dr. Almore. Marlowe discovers that
   Almore's wife had died under suspicious circumstances and that her
   death was probably hushed up by the police.

   Marlowe moves his investigations to Kingsley's vacation cabin at Little
   Fawn Lake. Kingsley has given him a note to the caretaker, Bill Chess.
   Chess is depressed over having been abandoned by his wife, Muriel, at
   about the same time as Crystal disappeared. As Marlowe and Chess walk
   over the property, they discover a drowned body that Chess identifies
   as his wife, bloated from decomposition and almost unrecognisable
   except by her clothes and jewellery. Chess is arrested for his wife's
   murder and Marlowe doubtfully returns to Los Angeles. On the way, he
   interviews some hotel employees who remember a woman matching Crystal's
   description and volunteer that a man was with her; their description of
   the man resembles Lavery.

   Marlowe returns to Bay City to interview Lavery again. At the house he
   finds Mrs. Fallbrook, who says she is the owner and has found a gun on
   the stairs. Once she has left, Marlowe ascertains that the gun has been
   fired and, after a search, finds Lavery murdered in the bathroom. Then
   he goes back to Kingsley, who offers him a bonus to prove Crystal
   didn't do it. Marlowe returns to Lavery's house, calls the police and
   reports the murder.

   Back at his office, Marlowe finds a note from Kingsley's secretary
   giving him the address of Dr. Almore's wife's parents. Marlowe visits
   them and learns that Almore's nurse was named Mildred Haviland. They
   also tell him they believe the doctor killed their daughter by drugging
   her and then putting her in the garage with the car motor running. The
   detective they hired was jailed for drunk driving and is not now in
   contact with them. After Marlowe goes to the detective's home and is
   rebuffed by the wife, he is followed by a police car. As with the
   detective before, the police force him to drink liquor and arrest him
   for speeding, resisting arrest and drunk driving. But Marlowe is able
   to convince the police captain of his innocence and is released.

   Returning to his office, Marlowe receives a call from Kingsley who
   tells him that Crystal has called, begging for $500. Kingsley gives the
   money to Marlowe to deliver. But when he meets Crystal at the agreed
   rendezvous, Marlowe insists that she answer his questions before
   receiving the money. Crystal agrees but only at a nearby apartment
   where she is staying. There he accuses her of being the murderer of
   Lavery. When she pulls a gun on Marlowe, someone hits him from behind
   with a sap.

   Marlowe wakes up stinking of gin and with Crystal lying naked, bloody
   and strangled to death on the bed. Soon the Bay City police are banging
   on the door. Degarmo tries to frame Marlowe for the murder, but Marlowe
   convinces him that the two of them can more easily frame Kingsley. They
   travel to Little Fawn Lake together to get some evidence that Marlowe
   implies is there.

   In the final confrontation at the cabin, Marlowe reveals that the
   murdered woman in Bay City, assumed to be Crystal Kingsley, was
   actually Mildred Haviland, killed in a jealous rage by Al Degarmo, who
   was her former husband. The murdered woman in Little Fawn Lake,
   supposed to be Muriel Chess, was actually Crystal Kingsley, killed by
   Mildred Haviland, who then assumed her identity. Mildred had formerly
   been Dr Almore's nurse, had murdered his wife and had also murdered
   Lavery.

   Degarmo attempts to escape but is killed while crossing a dam guarded
   by wartime sentries under orders to shoot potential saboteurs.
