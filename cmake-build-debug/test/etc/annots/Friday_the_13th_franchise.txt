   In the original Friday the 13th (1980), Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy
   Palmer) stalks and murders the teenagers preparing Camp Crystal Lake
   for re-opening. She is determined to ensure the camp does not reopen,
   after her son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake, due to the
   negligence of two staff members. The last counselor, Alice Hardy
   (Adrienne King), fends off Mrs. Voorhees long enough to grab a machete
   and decapitate her. In Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Jason (Steve
   Daskewisz/Warrington Gillette) is revealed to be alive and fully grown.
   After killing Alice Hardy, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to guard it
   from all intruders. Five years later, a group of teenagers arrive at
   Crystal Lake to set up a new camp, but Jason murders them. Ginny Field
   (Amy Steel), the last counselor Jason attempts to kill, finds a cabin
   in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs.
   Voorhees. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's
   shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an
   ambulance. During the events of Friday the 13th Part III (1982),
   Jason (Richard Brooker) removes the machete from his shoulder and finds
   his way to Chris Higgins' (Dana Kimmell) local homestead. Chris returns
   to her property with some friends, and Jason kills anyone who wanders
   into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to
   hide his face, Jason leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group.
   Chris seemingly kills Jason with an axe to his head, but the night's
   events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.

   Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984) continues where Part III
   leaves off, with Jason (Ted White) found by the police and taken to the
   local morgue after removing the axe. Upon arrival, Jason awakens to
   kill the coroner and a nurse before returning to Crystal Lake. A group
   of friends rent a house on Crystal Lake and fall victim to Jason's
   rampage. After killing the teens, Jason seeks out Trish (Kimberly Beck)
   and Tommy Jarvis (Corey Feldman), who live next door. While distracted
   by Trish, Jason is attacked and ultimately killed by Tommy. Friday
   the 13th: A New Beginning (1985) follows Tommy Jarvis (John Shepherd),
   who was committed to a mental health institution after the events of
   The Final Chapter and grew up constantly afraid that Jason (Tom Morga)
   would return. Roy Burns (Dick Wieand) uses Jason's persona to become a
   copycat killer at the halfway home to which Tommy has moved. Tommy,
   supervisor Pam (Melanie Kinnaman), and a young boy named Reggie (Shavar
   Ross) manage to defeat Roy. They eventually learn that Roy had a son
   who was murdered by one of the patients at the institution, triggering
   Roy to take on Jason's likeness and kill everyone there. Friday the
   13th Part VI: Jason Lives (1986) begins with Tommy (Thom Mathews)
   visiting Jason's grave after being released from another mental
   institution. Tommy inadvertently resurrects Jason (C. J. Graham) with a
   piece of the fence surrounding the cemetery acting as a lightning rod.
   Jason immediately heads back to Crystal Lake and kills the people
   working at the new summer camp. Tommy eventually chains Jason to a
   boulder that he tosses into the lake, where he leaves Jason who is
   revealed to be alive.

   Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) begins an indeterminate
   length of time after Jason Lives. Jason (Kane Hodder) is resurrected
   again by the telekinetic Tina Shepard (Lar Park Lincoln), who is trying
   to resurrect her father whom Tina caused to drown in the lake when she
   was a child. Jason once again kills those who occupy Crystal Lake and
   is returned to the bottom of the lake after a battle with Tina.
   Jason is resurrected again in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes
   Manhattan (1989) by an underwater electrical cable. He follows a group
   of students on their senior class cruise to Manhattan, where he kills
   the ship's crew and the majority of the students. Upon reaching
   Manhattan, Jason chases Rennie (Jensen Daggett) and Sean (Scott
   Reeves), the two remaining students, into the sewers. Jason eventually
   melts away because the sewer is flooded with toxic waste. In Jason
   Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993), Jason, through an unexplained
   resurrection, is hunted by the FBI at Crystal Lake. The FBI sets up a
   sting that successfully kills Jason. Through possession, Jason manages
   to survive by passing his black heart from one being to the next. It is
   revealed that he has a sister and a niece, and that he needs them to
   get his body back. Jason resurrects himself, but his niece, Jessica
   Kimble (Kari Keegan), stabs him with a mystical dagger and he is
   dragged into Hell.

   Jason X (2001) takes place in the future, when Jason has again been
   inexplicably resurrected. A scientist, Rowan LaFontaine (Lexa Doig),
   decides that cryonic suspension is the only method of stopping him, but
   Jason breaks free and kills the army personnel guarding him before he
   can be again imprisoned. Rowan manages to lure Jason into the
   cryo-chamber, but he ruptures the tank and freezes both himself and
   Rowan. Over 400 years later, a team of students studying Earth discover
   Jason's body and take it into space. Upon being thawed by the team, he
   proceeds to murder everyone aboard the spacecraft. He is seemingly
   killed, but is then resurrected via nanotechnology as a cyborg version
   of himself. Finally, he is ejected into space and incinerated by Earth
   Two's atmosphere, his mask falling to the bottom of a lake. The
   next Friday the 13th film, Freddy vs. Jason (2003), was a crossover
   with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Set in the contemporary period, Freddy
   Krueger (Robert Englund) resurrects Jason (Ken Kirzinger) and sends him
   to Springwood hoping that he will create enough fear among the
   residents that Freddy will be strong enough to invade their dreams.
   Jason accomplishes this but refuses to stop killing. A battle ensues
   both in the dream-world and at Crystal Lake. The outcome is left
   ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed
   head, which winks and laughs.

   In 2009, a new Friday the 13th film which restarted the film series
   continuity was released. In this film, after witnessing his mother
   being beheaded at a young age, an adult Jason (Derek Mears) follows in
   her footsteps and kills anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. Jason
   subsequently kidnaps a young woman, Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti),
   who resembles his mother at a young age. Six weeks after her
   disappearance, her brother, Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki), comes to
   look for her. The pair reunite and work together to seemingly kill
   Jason.
