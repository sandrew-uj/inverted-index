   Adam Reith is stranded on Tschai, a distant planet shared by four
   alien, mutually hostile, advanced species (the Chasch, Wankh, Dirdir
   and native Pnume). On his quest to get home, he acquires two human
   companions, Traz Onmale, a teenage barbarian chieftain, and Ankhe at
   afram Anacho, an outcast Dirdirman.

   Reith has failed twice to acquire a spaceship (as recounted in City of
   the Chasch and Servants of the Wankh). His exploits bring him to the
   unwanted attention of the Dirdir. As Anacho explains, his former
   masters are rarely subtle: they want to question and then kill him.
   Reith manages to wipe out the first "Initiative" sent after him, but
   sooner or later, there will be a second.

   He decides to build a ship from scratch, a task requiring vast amounts
   of sequins, the universal currency of Tschai. The only way to raise
   that much quickly is to brave the Carabas, the Dirdir hunting preserve,
   where sequins grow as crystalline nodes. Men prospect for the nodes,
   while the Dirdir hunt the men. Those they catch, they eat.

   Reith turns the tables on the Dirdir. He ambushes their hunting parties
   and takes the sequins they acquired from their victims. When the Dirdir
   finally take notice, Reith and his friends barely manage to escape, but
   they have amassed a fortune; in fact, they have so many sequins, they
   are forced to leave behind a substantial hidden cache.

   They journey to the cosmopolitan city of Sivishe, where there are
   shipyards. They find that they must deal with Aila Woudiver, an
   enormously obese man with monstrous appetites. The construction of the
   spaceship progresses satisfactorily, but Woudiver demands ever more
   money, threatening to turn them over to the Dirdir if he is not paid.
   Finally, Reith has no choice but to go back to the Carabas to retrieve
   the hidden sequins, leaving Traz and Anacho to keep watch.

   When he returns however, he finds that Woudiver, who desires above all
   else to be a Dirdirman, has betrayed Anacho to the Dirdir. Reith risks
   his life rescuing Anacho. Then he goes to confront Woudiver, but the
   arch-criminal is too clever for him and all three are handed over to
   the Dirdir.

   However, Reith demands arbitration, invoking a tradition too strong for
   the Dirdir to ignore, even from a "subman". When the judgment goes
   against him, he challenges the Dirdirman arbitrator. By Dirdir custom,
   the victor of hand-to-hand combat wins the case. Reith dispatches his
   foe, only to face a second set of charges. This time, he has to fight a
   Dirdir. When he forces the creature to concede, Reith and his friends
   are absolved of all crimes and freed. Needing Woudiver to complete the
   ship, they do not kill him, but take him captive.
