   On August 1st, 1941 Isaac Asimov proposed to John W. Campbell of
   Astounding Science Fiction that he write a short story set in a slowly
   declining Galactic Empire, based on the fall of the Roman Empire.
   Campbell liked the idea, and by the end of a two-hour meeting Asimov
   planned to write a series of stories depicting the fall of the first
   Galactic Empire and the rise of the second. Asimov submitted the first
   "Foundation" story on September 8th, Campbell purchased it on September
   15th, and Astounding published it in May 1942. Asimov wrote seven more
   stories over eight years, and they were collected into The Foundation
   Trilogy. Published from 1951 to 1953, the three books became Asimov's
   most popular science fiction and won a Hugo Award for Best All-Time
   Series in 1966.
