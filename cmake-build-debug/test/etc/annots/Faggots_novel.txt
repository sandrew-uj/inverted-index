   The main character, Fred Lemish, is loosely modeled on Kramer. Lemish
   wants to find a loving, long-term relationship. His desires are
   frustrated as he stumbles through an emotionally cold series of glory
   holes, bathhouses, BDSM encounters and group sex. He becomes
   disillusioned with the 1970s "fast lane" lifestyle dominating the gay
   subculture in and around New York.

   Lemish also expresses discomfort with the widespread use of multiple
   street and prescription drugs helping to maintain the party atmosphere.
   Faggots details the use of over two dozen 1970s party drugs and
   intoxicants such as Seconal, poppers, LSD, Quaaludes, alcohol,
   marijuana, Valium, PCP, cocaine and heroin.

   The book moves through, among other locales, a gay bathhouse called the
   "Everhard" (based on the Everard Baths), a large disco named Capriccio,
   an orgy at the apartment of a successful gay lawyer, the spectacular
   opening of a club called The Toilet Bowl, and ends with a tumultuous
   weekend on Fire Island.
