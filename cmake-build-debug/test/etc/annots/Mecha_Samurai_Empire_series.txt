   The Mecha Samurai Empire series is an alternate history science fiction
   series written by American author Peter Tieryas and released from
   2016-2020 by Ace Roc.^[1]^[2] The stories center around an alternate
   America where the Nazis and Japanese Empire won World War II, focusing
   primarily on the Asian side of the war. The themes of the novels deal
   with how survivors maintain their humanity in authoritarian regimes and
   come to terms with the horrors of war while facing off against a
   government that blurs fact and fiction.^[3] Though much of the story
   takes place within the United States of Japan, the story also jumps to
   other parts of the Empire, as well as the Quiet Border (the DMZ between
   the Nazis and Empire), and the German Americas. Each book in the series
   is a standalone novel, featuring new protagonists, villains, and
   conflicts. The series has been nominated for and won several awards,
   including Japan's top SF award, the Seiun, twice.^[4]
