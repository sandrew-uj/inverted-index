   Player Piano is set in the near future, after a third world war. While
   most Americans were fighting overseas, the nation's managers and
   engineers faced a depleted workforce and responded by developing
   ingenious automated systems that allowed the factories to operate with
   only a few workers. The novel begins ten years after the war when most
   factory workers have been replaced by machines. The bifurcation of the
   population is represented by the division of Ilium, New York into "The
   Homestead," where every person, not a manager or an engineer lives, and
   the other side of the river, where all the engineers and the managers
   live.

   Player Piano develops two parallel plotlines that converge only briefly
   and then insubstantially, at the beginning and the end of the novel.
   The more prominent plotline follows the protagonist, Dr. Paul Proteus
   (referred to as Paul), an intelligent, 35-year-old factory manager of
   Ilium Works. The secondary plotline follows the American tour of the
   Shah of Bratpuhr, a spiritual leader of six million residents in a
   distant, underdeveloped nation.

   The purpose of the two plotlines is to give two perspectives of the
   system: one from an insider who is emblematic of the system, and one
   from an outsider who is looking in on it. Paul, for all intents and
   purposes, is the living embodiment of what a man within the system
   should strive to be, and the Shah is a visitor from a very different
   culture and so applies a very different context to whatever he sees on
   his tour.

   The main plotline follows Paul's development from an uncritical cog in
   the system to one of its outspoken critics. Paul's father, George, was
   the first "National, Industrial, Commercial Communications, Foodstuffs,
   and Resources Director." George had almost complete control over the
   nation's economy and was more powerful than the President of the United
   States, who by then had effectively become a puppet. Paul has inherited
   his father's reputation and social status but harbors a vague
   dissatisfaction with the industrial system and his contribution to
   society. His struggle with that unnameable distress is heightened when
   Ed Finnerty, an old friend whom Paul has always held in high regard,
   informs him he has quit his important engineering job in Washington,
   DC. Paul and Finnerty visit a bar in the "Homestead" section of town,
   where workers who have been displaced by machines live out their
   meaningless lives in mass-produced houses. There, they meet an
   Episcopal minister, Lasher, with a M.A. in anthropology, who puts into
   words the unfairness of the system that the two engineers have only
   vaguely sensed. Paul eventually learns that Lasher is the leader of a
   rebel group known as the "Ghost Shirt Society," though Finnerty
   instantly takes up with him. Paul is not bold enough to make a clean
   break, as Finnerty has done, until his superiors ask him to betray
   Finnerty and Lasher. However, Paul purchases a rundown farm, managed by
   an elderly heir of the prior owners. Paul's intention is to start a new
   life by living off the land with his wife, Anita, but Anita is
   disgusted by Paul's wishes to change their lifestyle radically. Paul
   and Anita's relationship is one of emotional distance and personal
   disagreements. She and Paul had married quickly when it seemed that she
   was pregnant, but it turned out that Anita was barren and that it was
   just a hysterical pregnancy.^[3] "Of all the people on the north side
   of the river, Anita was the only one whose contempt for those in
   Homestead was laced with active hatred.... If Paul were ever moved to
   be extremely cruel to her, the cruelest thing he could do... would be
   to point out to her why she hated [Homesteaders] as she did: if he
   hadn't married her, this was where she'd be, what she'd be."^[4]

   She temporarily convinces Paul to stay in his position, and to continue
   to compete with two other engineers, Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Garth, for a
   more prominent position in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

   After rumors of Paul's disloyalty to the system and suspicious activity
   during the hosting of "the Meadows," an annual competition for high
   class engineers, begin circulating, Paul determines that with or
   without Anita, he must work with his friend Finnerty, among others, to
   stop the socioeconomic "system" of having machines replace humans. He
   quits his job and is captured by the "Ghost Shirt Society" in which he
   is made the public figurehead of the organization although the position
   is merely nominal. By his father's success, Paul's name is famous among
   the citizens and so the organization intends to use his name to its
   advantage by making him the false 'leader' to gain publicity. In the
   first Ghost Shirt Society meeting Paul attends, the police raid it and
   capture Paul.

   Paul is put on public trial but is freed as the Ghost Shirt Society and
   the general population begins to riot, destroying the automated
   factories. The mob, once unleashed, goes further than the Ghost Shirt
   leaders had planned, destroying both food production plants and the
   superfluous plants. Despite the brief and impressive success of the
   rebellion, the military quickly surrounds the town, and the citizenry,
   used to the comforts of the system, begin to rebuild the machines of
   their own volition. Paul, Finnerty, Lasher, and other members of the
   Ghost Shirt Society acknowledge that at least they had tried to stop
   the government's system before they surrender themselves to the
   military.
