   A centuries-long war between humans and vampires has devastated the
   planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called
   The Church. Despite the vampires' vulnerability to sunlight, and all of
   mankind's technological advances, the vampires' greater strength and
   speed made them impossible to defeat, until humanity sheltered in giant
   walled cities and trained a group of elite warriors, the Priests, which
   turned the tide.

   In the opening scene, a group of Priests enters the Sola Mira Hive but
   are ambushed by the vampires. As they attempt to retreat, one of their
   member is seized from behind, and their leader tries to pull him to
   safety, but is forced to let go and watch him dragged, screaming, back
   into the hive.

   Years later, the majority of the vampires have been killed, while the
   remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy
   disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out
   a living, free from the totalitarian control of The Church.

   Priest (Paul Bettany) is approached by Hicks (Cam Gigandet), the
   sheriff of a free town, Augustine. Priest learns that his brother,
   Owen, and Owen's wife, Shannon--Priest's girlfriend before he was
   recruited by the clergy--were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and
   Priest's niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), was kidnapped. Hicks asks for
   Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Church to reinstate his
   authority, but leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not
   believe the vampire story and refuses, insisting on maintaining the
   common belief that the vampires have been completely defeated, for fear
   of compromising the Church's authority. Priest defiantly leaves the
   city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess (Maggie Q) to bring
   him back.

   Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called
   Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient
   to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires.
   After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires
   have taken shelter in Sola Mira, which was thought to have been
   abandoned after the war. Priestess, one of Priest's team during the
   failed attack on the Hive, joins them at Sola Mira. The trio destroys a
   Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new
   army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called
   Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night
   falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires
   upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious
   human wearing a black hat (Karl Urban). When the three Priests reject
   Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.

   The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and
   discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified. Priest
   and Priestess share an intimate moment when she confesses her feelings
   for him, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel
   bound to her. Priest gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires
   have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns
   by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks
   believes the cities are likewise protected by the sun, but Priest
   explains that the cities' massive clouds of smoke and ash have
   permanently deprived them of sunlight. If the train reaches one of the
   cities, the attack will be a slaughter.

   Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, threatens Priest, believing that
   Priest intends to kill her if she has been infected by the vampires.
   Priestess explains that he cannot do so, because Lucy is actually
   Priest's daughter, and that Owen stepped in as a husband and a father
   when Priest was taken by the Church. Lucy was never told the truth
   about her parentage.

   While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks,
   Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and
   Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they
   find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as the priest who was lost in the
   attack on Sola Mira. After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him
   her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can
   survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth
   about her parentage. On the tracks ahead of the train, Priestess
   battles several Familiars, but one of them destroys the detonator for
   the explosives. Instead, she mounts the explosives on her motor bike
   and drives it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent
   derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in flames, while
   Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.

   Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass,
   telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not
   the Queen's. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor
   and shocking everyone in the room. Orelas still refuses to believe him,
   declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that it is just
   beginning. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess, who confirms that
   other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous
   point. Priest sets off into the sunset.
