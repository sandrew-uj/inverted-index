   Annals of the Twenty-Ninth Century: or, The Autobiography of the Tenth
   President of the World-Republic is a science fiction novel written by
   Andrew Blair, and published anonymously in 1874.^[1]

   Blair's work is one of a group of early science fiction novels that are
   now little known, but were influential in their own time--group that
   includes Edward Maitland's By and By (1873), Percy Greg's Across the
   Zodiac (1880), and John Jacob Astor IV's A Journey in Other Worlds
   (1894).^[2]^[3] Blair tells an extravagant tale of a future age in
   which the peoples of the Earth have been united in a Christian
   "Mundo-Lunar Republic", and other planets in the solar system have been
   reached and their native inhabitants encountered.

   One modern critic has called Blair's book "a hodge-podge of
   interplanetary travel and super-scientific inventions" but also "a
   speculation of Stapledonian magnitude."^[4] In the view of another,
   Blair portrays "the union of science and religion...under the sign of a
   positivist Deism mixed up with various utopian socialisms, and
   progressing from one technological wonder to another."^[5]
