     aren't."^[1]^[2]^[3]

   Frank Burnet has contracted an aggressive form of leukemia, and
   underwent intensive treatment and four years of semiannual checkups. He
   later learned the checkups were a pretext for researching the genetic
   basis of his unusually successful response to treatment, and the
   physician's university had sold the rights to Frank's cells to BioGen,
   a biotechnology startup company. As the book opens Frank is suing the
   university for unauthorized misuse of his cells, but the trial judge
   rules that the cells were "waste" and that the university could dispose
   of them as it wished. Frank's lawyers advise that the university, as a
   tax-funded organization, can still claim the rights to the cells under
   the doctrine of eminent domain.

   Ruthless venture capitalist "Jack" Watson conspires to steal or
   sabotage BioGen's cultures of Frank's cells. As part of his terms for
   financing BioGen, Watson previously forced the company to accept his
   irresponsible nephew Brad Gordon as its security chief. After Brad's
   carelessness nearly allows one of Watson's sabotage attempts to
   succeed, the company takes advantage of his attraction to teenage
   girls, and engineers his being accused and convicted of raping a minor.
   Watson's price for providing a defense lawyer is that Brad must
   contaminate BioGen's cultures. Brad's lawyer plans to claim in defense
   that Brad has a gene for recklessness and instructs him to engage in
   various high-risk activities. As a result, Brad gets into a fight with
   a pair of martial arts experts and is finally shot by the police.

   After Brad's sabotage, BioGen consults lawyers, who advise that under
   United States law they have the rights to all of Frank's cell line and
   thus the right to extract replacement cells, by force if necessary,
   from Frank or any of his descendants. When Frank goes on the run,
   BioGen hires bounty hunter Vasco Borden to obtain such cells,
   regardless of whether the donors consent. Vasco plans to snatch Frank's
   grandson Jamie from his school but is foiled by Jamie's mother Alex,
   whom he tries to seize instead. After escaping, Alex and Jamie also go
   on the run.

   Henry Kendall, a researcher at another biotech company, finds that his
   illegal introduction of human genes into a chimpanzee a few years ago
   while working at the NIH primate research facility unexpectedly
   produced a transgenic chimp, who can talk and whose behavior is
   generally childlike but reverts to chimp patterns under stress. The
   agency intends to destroy the chimp-boy, Dave, in order to cover up the
   unauthorized experiment, but Henry sneaks him out of the lab. Henry's
   wife Lynn strongly opposes bringing Dave into their home, but their
   son, also called Jamie, becomes close friends with him. Lynn becomes
   Dave's most determined defender, uploads reports of a fictitious
   genetic disease, creates an article about it on English Wikipedia to
   explain Dave's odd appearance, and grooms him as a senior female would
   groom a very young chimp in the wild. Dave is sent to the same school
   as Jamie and gets into trouble after biting the leader of a gang of
   bullies who attack Jamie. The chimp-boy becomes increasingly isolated
   at school; academically, he is backward in some areas such as writing,
   while in sports, his classmates regard him as unfair competition.

   Paris-based animal behavior researcher Gail Bond finds that her
   two-year-old grey parrot, Gerard, into which human genes were injected
   while he was a chick, has been helping her son produce near-perfect
   homework. While she is testing Gerard's abilities, the bird becomes
   bored and mimics the voices and other sounds of her husband having sex
   in their home with another woman. After a quarrel, Gail's husband, an
   investment banker, gives Gerard as a "money can't buy this" present to
   an influential and lecherous client. The client finds Gerard an
   embarrassment and passes him on to another owner, and so on.
   Eventually, Gerard ends up in the hands of Stan Milgram, who loses
   patience with Gerard's loquacity while delivering the parrot to yet
   another owner three days' drive away and leaves the bird by the
   roadside. Fortunately for Gerard the series of transfers has made his
   wings overdue for clipping, and he flies out of danger and off in
   search of more pleasant surroundings.

   After a few more narrow escapes, Alex and Jamie head for the home of
   her childhood friend Lynn. Vasco anticipates this move and tries to
   snatch Jamie - but abducts Lynn's son Jamie instead. Dave saves Lynn's
   Jamie, severely damaging both Vasco and the ambulance in which Vasco
   planned to extract the tissue samples. However Vasco's associate
   snatches Alex's son while everyone is celebrating the rescue of Lynn's.
   While the hunt was going on, Biogen's lawyers applied for a warrant to
   arrest Alex, on the grounds that she had stolen the company's property,
   namely her and her son's cells. She has to go straight from the fight
   to the courtroom, where her lawyer outplays Biogen's, and the judge
   adjourns to check details of the relevant laws and precedents
   overnight. Alex and Henry discover that Alex's son is being moved to a
   private clinic where the tissue samples are to be taken. As they move
   in to retrieve him, Gerard, now a resident of the clinic's gardens,
   reminds Jamie to shout for his mother, who rescues him. Vasco gives up
   after Dave attacks him, and Alex threatens him with a shotgun. The next
   day the judge rules in Alex's favor and rejects the precedents as
   attempts to abolish normal human feelings by decree, a violation of the
   Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which forbids
   slavery. The ruling will likely hamper research in the long run, and
   prevent patients from selling their tissues rather than donating them
   for research.

   Gerard is welcomed into Lynn's home. After he mimics telephone dial
   tones Lynn contacts Gail, and he is reunited with her. Press
   commentators praise the household as a trend-setting inter-species
   transgenic family, and Henry is honored by some scientific
   organizations.

   In other plot threads:
     * BioGen researcher Josh Winkler's drug-addicted brother accidentally
       exposes himself to a "maturity" gene that the company is developing
       for the control of irresponsible and addictive behavior. After Adam
       reforms within a few days, their mother pressures Josh to
       administer the gene to friends and relatives who also behave
       irresponsibly. By the end of the book all of his rat and human
       subjects die of accelerated old age.
     * The staff at a hospital provide samples from corpses for use by
       unscrupulous relatives in lawsuits, sell corpses' bones for medical
       uses, and desperately destroy records and samples to cover their
       tracks.
     * Henry Kendall's boss Dr. Robert Bellarmino, a mediocre scientist
       but skillful manipulator, is also a lay preacher and slants his
       comments to journalists, schoolchildren and politicians according
       to whether his audience has religious or pro-science inclinations.
       He is ultimately shot by Brad Gordon at an amusement park.
       Ironically, Bellarmino was only at the park to look for people who
       might have the gene for recklessness, and Gordon was only there to
       bolster the evidence for his lawyer's case that he has the gene.
     * An orangutan in Sumatra becomes famous for its comments, often
       obscene, in Dutch and French. An adventurer overdoses the orangutan
       with tranquillizer while trying to capture it, and has to give it
       mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. As a result, the orangutan dies from
       a respiratory infection, and an expert who dissects its corpse
       finds that its throat is very human-like but concludes from the
       shape of its skull that its brain is pure orangutan.
     * An avant garde artist uses genetic modification to change the
       appearance of animals, while another self-named "artist/biologist"
       is falsely accused of modifying turtles so that females laying eggs
       are less vulnerable to predators because the turtles' genetically
       engineered bioluminescence attracts tourists. An advertising agency
       proposes to make genetically engineered animals and plants carry
       advertisements, and claims that this would be a very effective
       conservation strategy.
     * Billionaire "Jack" Watson becomes the victim of an extremely
       aggressive form of genetic cancer, and is very nearly unable to
       receive treatment due to others' patents on the relevant genes,
       giving Watson "a taste of his own medicine". He eventually procures
       experimental treatment, which fails to save his life.
     * In a meeting, several prominent US Senators begin discussing
       various issues related to genetic modification, and realize that
       the science is outpacing the ability of the political system to
       introduce laws dealing with it.

   The book also features news report boxes, many about the genetics of
   blondes and of Neanderthals. These two themes combine into reports that
   Neanderthals were the first blondes, were more intelligent than
   Cro-Magnon humans and interbred with Cro-Magnons out of pity; and that
   "cavemen preferred blondes". At one point three successive reports
   feature a scientist's press release that Neanderthals had a gene that
   made them both behaviorally conservative and ecologically
   conservationist, an environmentalist's claim that modern humans need to
   learn from the Neanderthals lest they too become extinct, and a
   business columnist's interpretation that over-caution caused the
   Neanderthals' extinction.
