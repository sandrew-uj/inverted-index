   Kavan completed an early draft of Ice in March 1964. It was first
   submitted to Weidenfeld & Nicolson by Francis King, but was rejected.
   It was then accepted by Peter Owen, though he expressed doubts about
   the manuscript, citing a deficiency of character and narrative. Kavan
   defended the work, writing that "it is not meant to be realistic
   writing. It's a sort of present day fable..." She "saw the story as one
   of those recurring dreams ... which at times become nightmare. This
   dreamlike atmosphere is the essence of the ." Early readers
   described the novel as a cross between Kafka and The Avengers, which
   Kavan felt was an apt description.

   Over the next six months, the manuscript went through extensive
   revisions. Owen accepted the manuscript again, and convinced Kavan to
   change the title from The Ice World to simply Ice.

   Like most of Kavan's novels, Ice contains autobiographical elements
   that are fictionalized, but for this novel in particular are used in a
   surrealistic sense: Kavan's extensive travelling, her marriage to
   artist Stuart Edmonds, and her unhappy childhood are important
   inspirations for elements of the novel. The imagery of ice was
   inspired by Kavan's time in New Zealand, when she was not far from
   Antarctica. The Madagascan Indris, an element which reoccurs throughout
   the story, came to Kavan after watching a David Attenborough nature
   documentary.
