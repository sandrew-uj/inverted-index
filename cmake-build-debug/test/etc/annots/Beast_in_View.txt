   Helen Clarvoe gets a call from someone identifying themselves as
   "Evelyn Merrick" who offers her help dealing with her late father's
   finances but Clarvoe rejects her offer. The caller states that one day
   she will be famous and her body will be in every art museum in the
   country. Before hanging up the caller predicts that Helen will suffer
   injuries to the forehead and mouth. Later that evening while trying to
   write a letter to her mother Helen trips over a chair in her bedroom
   and suffers the exact injuries that the caller predicted. Scared, Helen
   calls her father's old acquaintance, investment councilor Paul
   Blackshear and asks him to come over to offer his advice. Blackshear,
   retired since the death of his wife from cancer, is initially reluctant
   to help but upon seeing Clarvoe's distress agrees to help track down
   Merrick. Going off the caller's comment that one day she will "be in
   every museum in the country," he deduces that she is an aspiring model
   and goes to the Lydia Hudson modelling school. Hudson tells Blackshear
   that Merrick claimed to have modeled for a photographer named Jack
   Terola. She also told her that she wanted to pose naked for portraits
   and that she wanted to become "immortal". Hudson put her in contact
   with a photographer named Harley Moore whom Blackshear goes to see.

   Bertha Moore, wife of Harley Moore gets a call from a person
   identifying themselves as Evelyn Merrick. She tells Bertha she is an
   acquaintance of her husband and the two happily discuss their baby and
   Bertha invites her over to see her. Bertha calls Harley to tell him
   that his acquaintance Evelyn Merrick is on her way to see the baby, at
   which point Harley who is in the middle of speaking to Blackshear, goes
   into a panic and tells Bertha to lock the doors and not let Evelyn in
   the house. Bertha does so but when Evelyn arrives at the house she
   taunts Bertha from outside the front door telling her that her husband
   is not as noble as she thinks he is as he may have fathered one of her
   children as well. Harley and Blackshear arrive just after Evelyn has
   left and Blackshear suspects that she is a non-violent sociopath who
   gets thrills from preying on people's fears.

   Blackshear goes to visit Helen's mother Verna who tells her that Evelyn
   is her son Dougie's estranged wife and moreover tells him that she met
   Dougie through Helen as the two were friends in college. After
   Blackshear leaves, Evelyn calls and tells Verna why she believes Dougie
   has been acting out lately which causes Verna to faint. (The novel does
   not elaborate on what Evelyn says to Verna at this stage.) Meanwhile,
   bartender Florian Vicente admonishes a woman in his bar for being on
   the phone for too long. The woman, who identifies herself as Evelyn
   Merrick, decides that Vicente must be punished for being rude. She goes
   to a payphone, calls Vicente's wife and tells him that his husband is
   "a pimp for niggers" before hanging up. She skips with delight down the
   road in the pouring rain. She goes into a diner, has a drink then
   attempts to call Helen but she does not pick up. She then calls Bertha,
   Verna and Terola but discovers they have all either changed their
   numbers or hang up as soon as they recognize her voice. Angered she
   vows to get even with Helen first.

   In her dream Helen experiences a flashback to her high school days
   where Evelyn attracted all the good looking boys at the school dance
   whereas Helen hid in the bathroom stall due to her shyness. That night
   she overheard her parents conversing and agreeing that they wish Helen
   was more like Evelyn. She is particularly affected when her father says
   that Helen's punishment is "having to be herself".

   Blackshear goes to Evelyn's house to meet with her mother Annabel. He
   learns that Evelyn returned from her honeymoon with Dougie prematurely
   stating she wanted an annulment from Dougie because he was "a pervert"
   and that he only married her to prove he wasn't a "fairy". That night
   Douglas comes home from his photography class with Terola and Verna
   deduces that the two of them are in fact lovers. Verna disowns Douglas
   and leaves the house to confront Terola and, after she has left, Dougie
   commits suicide by slashing his wrists. Blackshear goes to Helen to
   tell her the bad news about her brother but realizes that they can't go
   to the police because Evelyn hasn't technically committed a crime, she
   merely called Verna and told her something about Dougie which was true.
   They realize that all they can do is to try and learn everything they
   can about Evelyn and find out if she has committed any actual crimes.
   Blackshear goes to Terola's studio and finds him dead in his office
   with a pair of garden sheers stuck in his neck. Blackshear suspects
   that Verna is the murderer but she maintains that she changed her mind
   about going to see him. In the bathroom of the public library Evelyn
   washes blood off her clothes. She grabs a book and sits in the corner
   pretending to read so that she can contemplate what she has done and
   decide her next course of action. Through flashback it s revealed that
   she visited Terola and asked him to destroy the original photos he took
   of her as they didn't do her justice. When he refused and called her
   crazy she stabbed him. Her suspicious behavior is noticed by a Mr
   Hoffman in the library. She goes to a phone booth and calls a frantic
   Verna telling her that Helen is working in a call house.

   Blackshear learns of a friend of Evelyn's named Dr Clare Lawrence whom
   he goes to see. He tells her of Evelyn's recent activities and confides
   in her that he believes she developed multiple personality disorder
   after the break up of her parents marriage. As Blackshear is
   questioning Clare, Evelyn walks through the door. Blackshear demands to
   know where Helen is but Evelyn claims not to have seen her or her
   family for years.

   Helen wakes up in a call house heavily fatigued and having been loaded
   with alcohol. She escapes but realizes she is being followed by Evelyn.
   As she tries to escape she is knocked over by a taxi but is not
   seriously injured and when the crowd around her disperses Evelyn has
   disappeared. She gets the taxi driver to take her back to her hotel
   where she hides in her room. Evelyn arrives at the hotel along with
   Blackshear who has deduced that it is in fact Helen who has multiple
   personality disorder. Helen in fact hallucinated the phone call from
   "Evelyn", made the fatal phone call to her mother as "Evelyn", modeled
   for and eventually murdered Terola as Evelyn, went to work at the call
   house as Evelyn but drunkenly passed out and woke up as Helen and
   finally imagined that she was being chased by Evelyn. Blackshear
   determines that Helen, eternally jealous of Evelyn's popularity and
   feeling abandoned and betrayed by her parents, developed a separate,
   evil personality in order to be more like the real Evelyn. Helen
   quickly regains her memory in her hotel room and is engulfed by guilt.
   Blackshear and Evelyn go to Helen's room and beg her to come out so
   they can begin seeking treatment and rehabilitation for her. They tell
   her that she was a wonderful person the way she was and she had no
   reason to want to be someone else. Their efforts are futile as Helen,
   faced with the magnitude of what she has done, takes a knife and kills
   herself by plunging it into her throat.
