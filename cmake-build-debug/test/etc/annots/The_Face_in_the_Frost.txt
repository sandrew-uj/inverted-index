   The story opens with Prospero at home on a late summer day when he
   feels particularly uneasy. In the evening he receives an unexpected
   visit from his friend Roger Bacon, and the two discuss unusual
   phenomena that have transpired lately, especially those concerning a
   mysterious book for which Roger has been searching England. The
   following morning the two wizards find Prospero's house besieged by
   agents of some other wizard who seems to have ill designs for them.
   They escape the house by shrinking themselves down and sailing out on a
   model ship via an underground stream accessible through Prospero's
   basement. Once they regain their normal size they visit a library of
   records where Prospero discovers, as Roger stands guard outside, that a
   seal appearing in the mysterious aforementioned book belongs to
   Melichus, an old rival of his. Unfortunately, at that point a person
   comes into the library and claims to have killed Roger.

   Prospero flees the library and spends the night in a nearby town, where
   he luckily escapes an attack from some sort of evil creature sent by
   Melichus. The following day he travels to the cursed grove where
   Melichus is supposed to be buried, only to discover that the one buried
   there is not Melichus, but only one of his former servants. He
   presumes, therefore, that Melichus is still alive. After narrowly
   escaping from the cursed grove he travels to the town of Five Dials,
   where he stays at an inn with somewhat unsettling clientele and staff.
   Unable to sleep, he becomes suspicious of the inn and begins checking
   the other rooms, only to find them all empty. In the last room he finds
   the innkeeper with a large knife and flees the inn, whereupon he
   discovers that the entire town was an illusion (presumably created by
   Melichus).

   At last, Prospero and Roger are reunited at the actual site called Five
   Dials, a lone inn on the edge of the country. Here they discuss why
   Melichus is after Prospero: they once created a magical item together,
   a kind of crystal ball resembling a green glass paperweight. Since
   neither one can fully possess it without the other's cooperation,
   Prospero will have some share in Melichus' power until he is dead. They
   also determine that Melichus is using the mysterious book mentioned
   early in the story to create a permanent winter over the world. While
   staying the night at Five Dials they meet a small armed force that
   intends to attack a village across the border. Roger and Prospero
   thwart the army by destroying a necessary bridge and begin traveling to
   the village where the paperweight is kept, and where, they presume,
   Melichus is now. As they travel, unseasonably cold weather gradually
   sets in. Though the way to their destination is blocked, they find a
   monk herbalist who lets them in through a back entrance. Once in the
   village they do find Melichus studying the book. Prospero attempts to
   steal the paperweight, only to be transported to a different world.
   Melichus follows him there, but Prospero meets another wizard who takes
   the magical item and defeats Melichus. In the end, Prospero returns
   home to find that the early winter has subsided.

   The novel closes with a victory celebration of the wizards involved in
   vanquishing Melichus and destroying the book Melichus used.
