   The city has surrendered to a heat wave in July 1956. When detective
   Mike Reardon is on the way to work on the nightshift, he is murdered
   from behind with a .45 caliber handgun. As Steve Carella and his
   colleagues from the 87th Precinct are looking for their friend's
   killer, they have no idea that this is just the beginning of a series
   of police murders.

   David Foster is the next victim, at the entrance of his apartment,
   where the killer has left behind a footprint at the crime scene. Steve
   Carella and Hank Bush question the family and wives of the deceased, as
   well as some suspects, but to no avail. A few nights later the unknown
   killer ambushes and murders Det. Hank Bush. Bush fought back however
   and shot and wounded the murderer. Steve Carella fears he will be the
   next target if he fails to stop him.

   When Carella is leaving the precinct, he finds a reporter, Savage,
   waiting for him. He asks Carella his thoughts on who the killer might
   be, stating that everything is off the record. Carella reveals that -
   due to the evidence collected from Bush's murder - the police now knows
   certain attributes of the killer, i.e. weight, profession, and build.
   Carella leaves telling Savage that he is going on a date with his
   girlfriend, Teddy. The next day we find out that Savage has published
   the conversation between him and Carella, including Teddy's name and
   address.

   When Carella finds this out he rushes to Teddy's apartment, hoping the
   killer is not already there. When Carella arrives at Teddy's apartment
   he hears shouting and cursing coming from inside. With his .38 in hand,
   Carella enters Teddy's room and is immediately faced with a man aiming
   a .45 right at him. Carella drops to the floor the instant he enters
   the room and shoots the man holding the .45 twice in the thigh. After
   making sure Teddy is okay, Carella interrogates the man, finding out
   that his name is Paul Mercer and that he was the murderer of all three
   cops.

   After further interrogation it is discovered that Alice Bush was behind
   the whole plot; she had convinced a previously unknown man named Paul
   Mercer to commit the murders. Apparently she had promised him her
   affections once he had killed off her husband. In the end, both are
   sentenced to death for their crimes and Det. Carella marries his
   girlfriend, Teddy Franklin.
