   The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby is a children's novel by
   Charles Kingsley. Written in 1862-63 as a serial for Macmillan's
   Magazine, it was first published in its entirety in 1863. It was
   written as part satire in support of Charles Darwin's The Origin of
   Species. The book was extremely popular in England, and was a mainstay
   of British children's literature for many decades, but eventually fell
   out of favour in America in part due to its claimed prejudices against
   Irish, Jews, Catholics and Americans.^[2]
