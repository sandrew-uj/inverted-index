   The novel primarily focuses on the life story of Randall Peterson
   "Pete" Armstrong, a child prodigy with total recall memory, whose
   entire life's outlook has been defined by the tragic murder of his
   younger brother, Leonard, by an ex-convict who was believed to be
   capable of committing violent crimes again, but could not be imprisoned
   any longer under the current law structure. Pete is committed to making
   a difference for humanity that will atone for his brother's death and
   help millions of others, too. In his first year at Harvard at the age
   13, Pete is recruited to enroll in a small, but exclusive, class of the
   brightest and most agile students on campus. In that class, he meets
   people and establishes friendships that will further his identity. It
   is there that the idea of a 'truth machine' is conceived and Pete
   realizes that its existence is possible and that he could do it. The
   'truth machine' would be a mechanism that would be 100% accurate in
   determining if a person was lying or telling the truth. It could help
   eliminate crime and dishonesty in general. As long as it is employed
   universally (and not just by government officials), the 'truth machine'
   could revolutionize humanity and take it to that next evolutionary step
   which would help it avert its coming self-destruction.

   The protagonist places a back door in the book's otherwise infallible
   lie detector, allowing him to avoid detection when he repeats fragments
   of Walt Whitman's poem "O Captain! My Captain!" in his mind.
