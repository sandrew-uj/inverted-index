   Before Fowles published The French Lieutenant's Woman in 1969, he had
   already established his literary reputation with his novels The
   Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965). While writing The French
   Lieutenant's Woman, he was working on the screenplay for the film
   adaptation of The Magus (1968). Moreover, The Collector (1965) had
   already been adapted in a film which had gained Fowles further popular
   attention.

   Fowles described his main inspiration for The French Lieutenant's Woman
   to be a persistent image of a "Victorian Woman", who later developed
   into the novel's titular character Sarah Woodruff. In a 1969 essay
   entitled "Notes on an Unfinished Novel", Fowles reflects on his writing
   process. He said he had an image during the autumn of 1966 of: "A woman
    stands at the end of a deserted quay and stares out to sea."
   He determined that she belonged to a "Victorian Age" and had
   "mysterious" and "vaguely romantic" qualities. He made a note at
   the time about the function of the novel:

     "You are not trying to write something one of the Victorian
     novelists forgot to write; but perhaps something one of them failed
     to write. And: Remember the etymology of the word. A novel is
     something new. It must have relevance to the writer's now - so don't
     ever pretend you live in 1867; or make sure the reader knows it's a
     pretence."

   In an appended comment, dated "October 27, 1967", he writes that he
   finished the first draft of the novel at about 140,000 words.

   Throughout the essay, Fowles describes multiple influences and issues
   important to the novel's development, including his debt to other
   authors such as Thomas Hardy. In the essay, he describes surprise
   that the female character Sarah had taken the primary role in the
   novel. Later, Fowles described other influences shaping the
   characters development, noting that the characters and story of The
   French Lieutenant's Woman were loosely derived from the Claire de Duras
   novel Ourika (1823), which features a tragic affair between an African
   woman and French military man. Fowles later published a 1977
   translation of Ourika into English.
