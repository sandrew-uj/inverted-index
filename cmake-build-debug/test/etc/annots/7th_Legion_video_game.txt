   The conflict in 7th Legion takes place in the future. Rampant
   overpopulation and overuse of Earth's natural resources have regressed
   the planet's ecosystem to a critical point. The governments of Earth
   enact the Planetary Evacuation Program (PEP) to vacate the world in
   vast colony ships, leaving the planet to heal. Sufficient room and
   resources to house the entire population was not guaranteed on these
   exodus ships, and only a select few were able to earn a place on the
   ships and jump into Hyperspace. In the centuries following the
   evacuation, much of Earth's population perished, the scattered tribes
   of those left behind forming themselves into 7 "Legions", all vying for
   control of what is left. As the game begins, the seventh generation of
   the Chosen - those descended from the evacuees - return and aim to
   conquer the planet for themselves.
