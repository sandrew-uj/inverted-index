   The main protagonist of the novel is Dane Thorson,
   Cargo-master-apprentice on the Free Trader rocket ship the Solar Queen.
   Free Traders take on trading contracts on remote and recently
   discovered planets, which can be dangerous and unpredictable.

   The Solar Queen has recently obtained a valuable trading contract on
   the planet Sargol and are building a relationship with one of the races
   on the planet, the cat-like Salariki. The process goes slowly till the
   Salariki discover that the Solar Queen is carrying catnip and other
   plants from Terra that are unknown on Sargol. The traders exchange what
   little of the plants they have for the rare and valuable Koros stones
   and collect a native red-colored wood to exchange at home. At the last
   minute the storm priests of the Salariki demand that the Solar Queen
   take a pre-paid contract to return within 6 months with more plants.

   A few days after leaving the planet, several members of the crew suffer
   from attacks, which start with severe headaches and end in a semi-coma
   state. Only 4 of the younger members of the crew are unaffected,
   including Dane Thorson. Upon exiting hyperspace on return to the
   vicinity of Terra, the crew discovers that they are pariah and have
   been declared a plague ship.

   On the short hop to earth, the crew discovers that pests have invaded
   the ship and are the cause of the illness. In a final bid to prove
   their case they kidnap a medic and present his evidence by video to a
   solar-system-wide audience, which is successful.

   In the meantime the rest of the crew have recovered, and after a final
   effort of negotiation the Solar Queen preserves its reputation by
   selling the contract with the Salariki to a large intergalactic trading
   company in exchange for credits and a quiet inter-solar mail route,
   which should lead to no more trouble.
