   Charles Dalgleish Forrester is revived from cryopreservation in the
   year 2527, having been killed in a fire 500 years earlier. Thanks to
   his insurance, after the expenses of his revival are paid he has a
   quarter of a million dollars, a fortune in his eyes. He can afford the
   luxuries of 26th century life, such as a Joymaker, a scepter-like
   portable computer terminal with some extra features like a drug
   dispenser.

   After a heavy night partying, with some distant memory of an argument
   with somebody, he wakes in his new apartment, and over a 20th-century
   breakfast, checks in with his Joymaker. The Joymaker communicates by
   voice, and addresses him always as "Man Forrester". He is informed that
   he has a message from a woman whose name he doesn't recognize, and that
   someone called Heinzlichen Jura de Syrtis Major has taken out a hunting
   license on him. Baffled, he eventually encounters the woman from the
   party who he believes is called Tip. She maintains she is Adne Bensen,
   the woman whose messages he has been ignoring. Apparently she got on so
   well with Forrester that she is ready to begin a relationship. She
   takes him back to her apartment, where he finds she has two children,
   around 8 years old, who seem somewhat precocious for their years. With
   names like "Tunt" and "Mim" flying around, he mistakenly assumes those
   are the children's names, baffling them when he uses them that way.

   Later Forrester encounters Heinzlichen with a few friends, who without
   much ado beat him up so badly he goes to the hospital. It transpires
   that Heinzlichen's hunting license allows him to kill Forrester
   providing he pays for the revival, and the whole vendetta is over some
   insult at the party, which Forrester can barely remember. It's possible
   Forrester trod on Heinzlichen's foot. Since Heinzlichen is from the
   human colonies on Mars and is adapted to low gravity, this is a major
   faux pas.

   Mistake follows on mistake, compounding confusion. Forrester comes to
   believe that Adne is attempting to entrap him in fatherhood, presumably
   for his money, when she leaves a message saying that "we have to choose
   a name". He is equally disdainful of a friend who keeps asking him to
   join his Club, expecting that also to be just a ruse to get at his
   money.

   Eventually Adne sets him straight. Firstly, he'll be broke soon
   because, unbeknownst to him, all the 20th century foods he likes are
   very expensive, as are all the other Joymaker functions he enjoys. He
   needs to get a high-paying job. Secondly, the "name" she was asking
   about was a "reciprocal name," one used only between two close friends
   or intimates. Each uses it only to address the other, as "Tunt" was the
   children's name for each other, and "Mim" was the name used between
   Adne and the children. Tip was the name she and another close friend
   used, so Forrester could not use it. The friend wanting Forrester to
   join his Club was in fact offering him a paying position in the
   organization, though Forrester is not sure he likes what the Club
   stands for.

   However, Forrester's woes are not over. He first takes a high-paying
   job for what turns out to be an alien life form. The alien is known to
   all as a Sirian, but only because that's the star system in which he
   was captured (Sirius). Earth is in a state of preparation for a Sirian
   attack it is expecting. When the alien ship was first encountered, the
   Earth ship shot first and asked questions later. The only thing
   stopping an attack, it is believed, is that the Sirian's home world
   population has no idea where Earth is. The captured Sirians live on
   Earth in a state of virtual house arrest, with their movements
   restricted and monitored. Forrester's job is to be the Sirian's guide
   to Earth culture and history, and is paid handsomely for it.
   Unfortunately Adne and the others shun him for working for the alien.

   The Sirian asks many questions about seemingly arbitrary topics of
   human history. When Forrester fails to respond to one of the Sirian's
   requests in time, he is promptly fired by the Sirian.

   He then takes a high-paying job which is an apparent sinecure, watching
   over some machinery, until he learns that all the previous holders of
   the post are in cryopreservation after being blasted with radiation.
   Against the warnings of the Joymaker, he quits in the middle of a
   shift. In this time, this is a huge error, and all his funds are taken
   in fines. He is reduced to nothing, and forced to live with all the
   other bums on Skid Row.

   The existence is actually quite comfortable. Nobody can afford a
   Joymaker, but rich people pass through doling out money to 26th century
   panhandlers, and there are cash-only eating places with coin-operated
   Joymakers at the tables. However, there are also people looking for
   thrills on the cheap, wanting to kill someone without having to pay for
   the revival. After a near miss, he runs into the Sirian again, who
   drugs and hypnotizes him. Under the delusion that he is helping Adne
   take a trip, Forrester places the Sirian in control of a spacecraft.

   The ship heads into space and escapes, but not before the whole world
   learns that the alien has escaped, though not Forrester's role in the
   affair. The entire human population goes into a panic. Most commit
   suicide in order to hide in the cryopreservation banks. Heinzlichen
   comes after Forrester one more time, and Forrester kills him. This was
   simply Heinzlichen's way of getting into the freezer. Eventually
   Forrester is almost alone.

   At this point the Club he had been asked to join goes into action. They
   are a 26th-century version of Luddites and are bent on dismantling the
   world's technological base by subverting central computing systems,
   believing this will improve human welfare. Ominously, they are "helped"
   by the Sirians in doing so. In the end, medical technicians and the
   Luddites are the only people left awake. Forrester learns about the
   conspiracy of the Luddites. Forrester cannot reach the technicians
   because all the computer terminals have been programmed against him.
   His only hope is to kill himself. He walks up to one of the automated
   medics, and cuts his throat.

   Fortunately the medic, reacting to its programming to save lives over
   that set up by the Luddites, gets him to a medical facility in time,
   and he is able to abort the revolution. Eventually people start being
   revived, and he is reunited with Adne.
