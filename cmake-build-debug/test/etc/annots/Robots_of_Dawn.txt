   Detective Elijah Baley of Earth is training with his son and others to
   overcome their socially ingrained agoraphobia when he is told that the
   Spacer world of Aurora has requested him to investigate a crime: the
   destruction of the mind of R. Jander Panell, a humaniform robot
   identical to R. Daneel Olivaw, with a mental block. The robot's
   inventor, Han Fastolfe, has admitted that he is the only person with
   the skill to have done this, but denies having done so. Fastolfe is
   also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors
   Earth; therefore, it is politically expedient that he be exonerated. En
   route to Aurora, Baley again is partnered with R. Daneel Olivaw, and
   introduced to R. Giskard Reventlov, a robot of an earlier model.

   On Aurora, he interviews Gladia Delmarre, R. Jander's last owner, and
   discovers that Gladia had a sexual relationship with Jander, to the
   point of considering him husband in an emotional sense. Baley later
   interviews Fastolfe's estranged daughter, Vasilia Fastolfe (alias
   "Vasilia Aliena"), who claims that her father would do anything
   necessary to advance psychohistory, including the incapacitation of
   Jander and Gladia's heartbreak. Following that, Baley interviews
   Santirix Gremionis, an Auroran who, with both Gladia and Vasilia,
   committed the Auroran taboo of offering himself repeatedly (sexually)
   after rejection. Gremionis denies involvement in the murder, and says
   he has reported Baley to the Chairman (the executive of the Auroran
   Government) for slander; but realizes, upon questioning, that Vasilia
   arranged his infatuation with Gladia.

   Next, Baley interviews Kelden Amadiro, Fastolfe's chief political rival
   and head of the Robotics Institute, who explains the Institute's
   political motivations: that they wish to see Aurora alone colonize the
   Galaxy, by means of humaniform robots which at present only Fastolfe
   can build. On the way from the interview with Amadiro, Baley's airfoil
   (a personal hovercraft) is forced to stop. The air compressor has been
   sabotaged. Baley, suspecting Amadiro, orders Daneel and Giskard to
   flee. When several robots catch up with the car and question Baley,
   Baley tells them that he ordered Daneel back to the Robotics Institute,
   and they leave. Baley flees the car into the thunderstorm outside,
   where his agoraphobia renders him unconscious. He is recovered by
   Gladia and Giskard, and taken to Gladia's house. At an earlier-arranged
   meeting with the Chairman, Fastolfe, and Amadiro, Baley accuses Amadiro
   of sabotaging the car so that he could keep him, helpless, in the
   Institute, and thus have a legitimate reason to have Daneel there as
   well, unsupervised. As Baley states, without Fastolfe's cooperation,
   the only way to obtain knowledge about humaniform robots is to reverse
   engineer Daneel by thorough questioning, which would have allowed
   Amadiro to learn the details of his workings.

   While logically consistent, Baley's unsupported accusation cannot stand
   against a formal denial by an Auroran as prominent and respected as
   Amadiro. However, Baley then confronts Amadiro with the revelation that
   Amadiro knew of the relationship between Gladia and Jander, and
   moreover, of her considering him her husband; something quite
   unthinkable for a native Auroran. Amadiro says he may have heard it
   from someone, but cannot remember whom.

   Baley then states that only one Auroran could have told Amadiro about
   the relationship: Jander himself. Then, he gives the solution to the
   mystery: that in Gladia's absence, Amadiro questioned and tested Jander
   via trimensional viewing (telepresence). Daneel was part of Fastolfe's
   establishment, and thus well guarded, but Jander was at the house of
   the much less skilled Gladia, thus questioning him for reverse
   engineering purposes was much easier. Gremionis was encouraged to court
   Gladia because they tended to take long walks together, allowing
   Amadiro more time for his testing. The sabotage to the car was intended
   to capture Daneel and complete the analysis.

   When Baley states that these experiments might have accidentally led to
   Jander's deactivation, Amadiro snaps and states the experiments were
   completely harmless. Thus, he effectively admits he was working with
   Jander, which makes his situation hopeless. As a result, he is forced
   to compromise with Fastolfe's policies; Amadiro agrees with Earth's
   right to share in the galactic colonization, while Fastolfe gives the
   Institute his data about humaniform robot design. Baley, however,
   confronts Giskard, who admits that Vasilia unknowingly gave him
   telepathic abilities during experiments when she was a child. Using
   knowledge derived from Han Fastolfe's mind, Giskard shut down Jander,
   to thwart Amadiro's attempt to build humaniform robots. Giskard allows
   Baley to retain knowledge of his abilities, but prevents him (with the
   help of his telepathic abilities) from revealing the secret.
