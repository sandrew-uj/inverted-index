   The story revolves around Ned Beaumont, a gambler and best friend of
   the criminal political boss Paul Madvig. Ned finds the body of a
   senator's son on the street, and Madvig asks him to thwart the D.A.'s
   investigation, his motive being that he wants to back the corrupt
   senator in order to marry his daughter, Janet. Ned goes to New York
   searching for Bernie, a bookie who owes him a great deal of money from
   a gambling debt but ends up getting beaten up.

   Someone sends a series of letters to people close to the crime, hinting
   that Madvig was the murderer. Suspicion for this falls on Madvig's
   daughter Opal, the victim's girlfriend. Madvig's political base begins
   to crumble when he refuses to spring a follower's brother from jail.
   The follower goes to rival mob boss Shad O'Rory, who eliminates a
   witness to the brother's crime. Madvig then declares war on O'Rory, who
   offers to bribe Beaumont to expose Madvig in the newspaper. Beaumont
   refuses, is knocked unconscious and wakes captive in a dingy room where
   he is beaten daily.

   Hospitalized after his escape, Beaumont tells Madvig and Janet that he
   was laying a trap for O'Rory; he then struggles out of bed to stop the
   newspaper from printing its expose. Beaumont confronts O'Rory, the
   publisher, and Madvig's daughter Opal. The publisher commits suicide,
   after Beaumont seduces his wife.

   Next Beaumont interviews Janet, discovering that she wrote the letters
   and that the Senator knew about the murder before Beaumont found the
   body. A new clue points to Madvig and when confronted he confesses but
   he cannot account for the victim's hat, a detail Beaumont pointedly
   repeats throughout the novel.

   This impasse and Beaumont's growing interest in Janet, Madvig's love
   interest, cause a second rift between the men. Beaumont and Janet pair
   up to solve the murder. Beaumont uncovers evidence proving the senator
   killed his own son and turns him over to the police. Beaumont confronts
   Madvig with his new discovery, and the two depart, not enemies but no
   longer friends.
