   A worldwide nuclear war sometime in the 1990s has resulted in the
   destruction of most of civilization, turning the world into a desert
   wasteland. The remnants of mankind fight over whatever supply of food
   and uncontaminated water still remaining as the strong prey on the
   weak. Kenshiro is the successor to Hokuto Shinken, an ancient martial
   art of assassination that trains its practitioners to kill from within
   an opponent's body through the use of hidden meridian points. Kenshiro
   wishes to live his life in peace, but after he is separated from his
   fiancee Yuria by a jealous rival, he begins his journey to become the
   savior of the post-apocalyptic world, defending the weak and innocent
   from the many gangs and organizations that threaten their survival.
   Along the way, Kenshiro meets a young thief named Bat and an orphaned
   girl named Lin, who join him as his traveling companions and bear
   witnesses to Ken's many battles.

   Kenshiro ends up encountering numerous rival martial artists, including
   the six grandmasters of Nanto Seiken, a rival assassin's art, as well
   as his own adoptive brothers who competed with him for the Hokuto
   Shinken succession. Kenshiro's ultimate nemesis ends up becoming his
   eldest brother-in-training Raoh, a warrior who broke the law of Hokuto
   Shinken by killing his master Ryuken and refusing to surrender the
   succession to Kenshiro. Raoh seeks to conquer the post-apocalyptic
   world as a warlord under the mantle of Ken-oh, the King of the Fist, by
   challenging every martial artist he sees as a threat. After a long
   series of battles, Kenshiro emerges victorious over Raoh and it seems
   peace has finally come to the post-apocalyptic world, concluding the
   first half of the story.

   The second half begins several years later after a tyrannical empire
   under the name of the Celestial Empress has risen to power, oppressing
   anyone who dares to oppose them. Kenshiro comes into action, joining
   the now-grown Bat and Lin under the banner of the Hokuto Army. As they
   fight their way into the Empire's capital city, they discover that the
   Empire has been taken over by the Viceroy Jakoh, a usurper who is
   keeping the real Celestial Empress captive in his dungeon. The Hokuto
   Army free the Empress, who turns out to be Lin's long-lost sister and
   Jakoh is shortly vanquished afterward.

   However, Lin is taken captive by the remnant of Jakoh's forces and is
   sent off to the mysterious Kingdom of Shura, a brutal land of warriors
   ruled by three overlords who have all mastered the ways of Hokuto
   Ryuken, a martial art which branched off from the same clan alongside
   Hokuto Shinken into the ways of darkness. Kaioh, the head of the three
   overlords, plans to conquer the post-apocalyptic world in the name of
   evil by wiping out the followers of Hokuto Shinken. Kenshiro uncovers
   the sealed testament of the Hokuto Shinken founder, Shuken, which holds
   the secret to overcoming Kaioh's ultimate technique. Kenshiro emerges
   victorious over Kaioh and rescues Lin, leaving her under Bat's care.
   During the final chapters, Kenshiro goes on a journey with Raoh's
   orphaned son Ryu, in order to lead him on the path to become the next
   Hokuto Shinken successor, encountering and battling various opponents
   along the way, before returning to Bat and Lin to protect them from a
   past enemy.
