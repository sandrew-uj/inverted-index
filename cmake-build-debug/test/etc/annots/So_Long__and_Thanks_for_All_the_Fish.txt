   While hitchhiking through the galaxy, Arthur Dent is dropped off on a
   planet in a rainstorm. He appears to be in England on Earth, even
   though he saw the planet destroyed by the Vogons. He has been gone for
   several years, but only a few months have passed on Earth. He hitches a
   lift with a man named Russell and his sister Fenchurch (nicknamed
   "Fenny"). Russell explains that Fenny became delusional after worldwide
   mass hysteria, in which everyone hallucinated "big yellow spaceships"
   (the Vogon destructor ships that "demolished" the Earth). Arthur
   becomes curious about Fenchurch, but he is dropped off before he can
   ask more questions. Inside his heretofore undamaged home, Arthur finds
   a gift-wrapped bowl inscribed with the words "So long and thanks",
   which he uses for his Babel Fish. Arthur considers that Fenchurch is
   somehow connected to him and to the Earth's destruction. He still has
   the ability to fly whenever he lets his thoughts wander.

   Arthur puts his life in order, and then tries to find out more about
   Fenchurch. He accidentally finds her hitchhiking and picks her up. He
   obtains her phone number, but shortly thereafter loses it. He
   haphazardly discovers her home when he searches for the cave he had
   lived in on prehistoric Earth; her flat is built on the same spot. They
   find more circumstances connecting them. Fenchurch reveals that,
   moments before her "hallucinations", she had an epiphany about how to
   make everything right, but then blacked out. She has not been able to
   recall the substance of the epiphany. Eventually discovering that
   Fenchurch's feet do not touch the ground, Arthur teaches her how to
   fly. They have sex in the skies over London.

   In a conversation with Fenchurch, she learns from Arthur about
   hitchhiking across the galaxy and Arthur learns that all the dolphins
   disappeared shortly after the world hallucinations. He and Fenchurch
   travel to California to see John Watson, an enigmatic scientist who
   claims to know why the dolphins disappeared. He has abandoned his
   original name in favour of "Wonko the Sane", because he believes that
   the rest of the world's population has gone mad. Watson shows them
   another bowl with the words "So long and thanks for all the fish"
   inscribed on it, and encourages them to listen to it. The bowl explains
   audibly that the dolphins, aware of the planet's coming destruction,
   left Earth for an alternate dimension. Before leaving, they pulled the
   Earth from a parallel universe into this one and transported everyone
   and everything onto it from the one about to be destroyed. After the
   meeting, Fenchurch tells Arthur that while he lost something and found
   it, she had found something and lost it. She desires that they travel
   to space together, and reach the site where God's Final Message to His
   Creation is written.

   Ford Prefect discovers that the Hitchhiker's Guide entry for Earth has
   been updated to include the volumes of text he originally wrote,
   instead of the previous truncated entry, "Mostly harmless". Curious,
   Ford hitchhikes across the galaxy to reach Earth. Eventually he uses
   the ship of a giant robot to land in the centre of London, causing a
   panic. In the chaos, Ford reunites with Arthur and Fenchurch, and they
   commandeer the robot's ship. Arthur takes Fenchurch to the planet where
   God's Final Message to His Creation is written, where they discover
   Marvin. Due to previous events, Marvin is now approximately 37 times
   older than the known age of the universe and is barely functional. With
   Arthur and Fenchurch's help, Marvin reads the Message ("We apologise
   for the inconvenience"), utters the final words "I think... I feel good
   about it", and dies happily.
