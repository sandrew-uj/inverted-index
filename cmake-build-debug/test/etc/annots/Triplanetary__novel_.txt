   Triplanetary is a science fiction novel and space opera by American
   writer E. E. Smith. It was first serialized in the magazine Amazing
   Stories in 1934. After the original four novels of the Lensman series
   were published, Smith expanded and reworked Triplanetary into the first
   of two prequels for the series. The expanded Triplanetary was published
   in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press. The second prequel, First
   Lensman, was a new original novel published in 1950 by Fantasy Press.

   The novel covers several episodes in an eons-long human breeding
   project by the super-intelligences of the Arisians. This alien race is
   breeding two genetic lines to become the ultimate weapon in Arisia's
   cosmic war with their arch-enemies, the Eddorians. The initial chapters
   cover the Kinnison genetic line during the fall of Atlantis and Nero's
   reign in Rome. These tales were inserted into the novel following the
   serialized release, along with chapters covering members of the
   Kinnison line in World Wars One, Two, and Three.

   The final chapter of Triplanetary tells of the discovery of the
   inertialess drive that allows faster-than-light travel. Patrolman
   Conway Costigan and his friends engage in a space battle with Gray
   Roger the pirate gangster. This conflict is complicated by the arrival
   of the technologically superior, extra-Solar, amphibian-like Nevians,
   resulting in the first interstellar war involving humans. In this story
   Virgil Samms and Roderick Kinnison, important members of the two
   breeding lines, are introduced.
