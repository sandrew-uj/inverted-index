   In the alternate universe, life exists on Venus and Mars. Because of
   the discovery, the United States and the Soviet Union have poured all
   of their resources into space exploration and sent their best and
   brightest to colonize Venus and Mars. Although there have been a few
   outbreaks of hostilities on Earth, an uneasy detente exists in space
   between the Americans and the Soviets, who are struggling for supremacy
   and supported by their respective allies. The European Union is also
   anxious not to be excluded from the neocolonial race but is far behind
   the other powers.

   In 1962, the Soviets drop planetary probes on Venus and discovers
   people, both humans and Neanderthals, on the planet. Crewed flights by
   the Soviets and later by the Americans establish bases on the planet
   (the American one is named Jamestown, the Soviet one Cosmograd) and
   find other familiar species, including dinosaurs. Both fauna and flora
   are strangely similar to those from Earth's past.

   In 1988, Lieutenant Marc Vitrac, a Ranger in the US Aerospace Force,
   has been on the planet for a year. Born in a Cajun family amidst the
   Louisiana bayous, his primary function is exploration of the vast wild
   lands, but at the beginning of the novel, he is tapped to welcome
   newcomers to the colony.

   The new arrivals are somewhat taken back by the ceratopsia used as a
   shuttle bus. The dinosaur has been "iced" by the insertion of an
   Internal Control Device into its brain, which allows the creature to be
   controlled with messages sent directly to the brain.

   The new arrivals include Cynthia Whitlock, a young African-American
   specialist, and Wing Commander Christopher Blair, a supposedly-British
   linguist. As with all the Terrans on the planet, Cynthia and Blair also
   have other skills. Blair spends most of his time in the nearby town of
   Kartahown and extends their knowledge of one of the native languages.

   As the story progresses, many of the characters comment about how
   similarly evolution has progressed on Venus and on Earth. Naturally,
   the scientists at the Jamestown base are puzzled by the seeming
   parallelisms of evolution. Although the base has no means to check DNA
   (as in the alternate timeline, most research funding has been spent on
   space travel), other tests indicate that the natives are closely
   related to Terrans. The fossil record is very spotty, with occasional
   infusions of new species, but no one has an explanation as to why there
   are humans and other Earth animals and plants on Venus.

   On another part of Venus, an unknown external force interferes with the
   computer on a Soviet shuttle and causes it to crash-land into the
   unexplored wild lands. The Soviets ask for American assistance to
   recover the crew. The airship Vepaja, with Captain Tyler commanding, is
   selected for the rescue attempt, and Marc, Cynthia, and Chris are
   chosen as the crew. Jadviga Binkis, the wife of the Soviet shuttle
   commander, is also included in the crew. Marc also takes his Epicyon
   pup, Tahyo, with them.

   The weather, animals, mechanical failure, and sabotage from an unknown
   enemy eventually force the group to abandon the airship. Once it
   arrives at its destination, it finds itself in the midst of a civil war
   between the very-human Cloud Mountain People and the Neanderthals.
   Additionally, an alien AI is annoyed at the Terrans for interfering
   with the Venusians. The AI is sapient but not sentient and can control
   both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis within a short range.
   Unsure what to do, the AI calls for its creator race to return.
   Additionally, Blair discovers that the Cloud People speak a
   Proto-Indo-European language, which indicates that the creator race has
   taken Homo sapiens from earth and seeded them on Venus within the last
   several thousand years. The group sides with the Cloud Mountain People
   since Marc having fallen in love with their princess and helps them
   defeat the Neanderthals. The Cloud Mountain People's lands are
   destroyed, however, by a biological weapon on board the downed Soviet
   shuttle. Marc thus leads the Cloud Mountain People on a five thousand
   mile overland journey back to Jamestown to settle around the base and
   brings with him an alien artifact, which may be evidence of the alien
   race that brought life to Venus and Mars.
