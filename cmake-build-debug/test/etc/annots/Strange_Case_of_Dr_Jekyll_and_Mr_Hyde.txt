   Gabriel John Utterson and his cousin Richard Enfield reach the door of
   a large house on their weekly walk. Enfield tells Utterson that months
   ago, he saw a sinister-looking man named Edward Hyde trample a young
   girl after accidentally bumping into her. Enfield forced Hyde to pay
   him -L-100 to avoid a scandal. Hyde brought Enfield to this door and
   gave him a cheque signed by a reputable gentleman later revealed to be
   Doctor Henry Jekyll, Utterson's friend, and client. Utterson fears Hyde
   is blackmailing Jekyll, as Jekyll recently changed his will to make
   Hyde the sole beneficiary. When Utterson tries to discuss Hyde with
   Jekyll, Jekyll tells Utterson he can get rid of Hyde when he wants and
   asks him to drop the matter.

   One night in October, a servant sees Hyde beat Sir Danvers Carew,
   another one of Utterson's clients, to death and leaving behind half a
   broken cane. The police contact Utterson, who leads officers to Hyde's
   apartment. Hyde has vanished, but they find the other half of the
   broken cane. Utterson recognizes the cane as one he had given to
   Jekyll. Utterson visits Jekyll, who shows Utterson a note, allegedly
   written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologizing for the trouble that he has
   caused. However, Hyde's handwriting is similar to Jekyll's own, leading
   Utterson to conclude that Jekyll forged the note to protect Hyde.

   For two months, Jekyll reverts to his former sociable manner, but in
   early January, he starts refusing visitors. Dr. Hastie Lanyon, a mutual
   acquaintance of Jekyll and Utterson, dies of shock after receiving
   information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson
   a letter to be opened after Jekyll's death or disappearance. In late
   February, during another walk with Enfield, Utterson starts a
   conversation with Jekyll at his laboratory window. Jekyll suddenly
   slams the window and disappears, shocking and concerning Utterson.

   In early March, Jekyll's butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson and says
   Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for weeks. Utterson and
   Poole break into the laboratory, where they find Hyde's body wearing
   Jekyll's clothes, apparently having killed himself. They find a letter
   from Jekyll to Utterson. Utterson reads Lanyon's letter, then Jekyll's.
   Lanyon's letter reveals his deterioration resulted from the shock of
   seeing Hyde drink a serum that turned him into Jekyll. Jekyll's letter
   explains he had indulged in unstated vices and feared discovery. He
   found a way to transform himself and thereby indulge his vices without
   fear of detection. Jekyll's transformed body, Hyde, was evil,
   self-indulgent, and uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll
   controlled the transformations with the serum, but one night in August,
   he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.

   Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. Despite this, one night he had
   a moment of weakness and drank the serum. Hyde, his desires having been
   caged for so long, killed Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly
   to stop the transformations. Then, in early January, he transformed
   involuntarily while awake. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the
   police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid capture. He wrote to
   Lanyon in Jekyll's hand, asking his friend to bring chemicals from his
   laboratory. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the chemicals, drank the
   serum, and transformed into Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated
   Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll's involuntary
   transformations increased in frequency and required ever larger doses
   of the serum to reverse. It was one of these transformations that
   caused Jekyll to slam his window shut on Enfield and Utterson.

   Eventually, one of the chemicals used in the serum runs low, and
   subsequent batches prepared from new stocks failed to work. Jekyll
   speculated that one of the original ingredients must have had some
   unknown impurity that made it work. Realizing that he would stay
   transformed as Hyde, Jekyll wrote out a full account of the events and
   locked himself in his laboratory with the intent to keep Hyde
   imprisoned before committing suicide by poison.
