   The book is narrated by "Chief" Bromden, a gigantic yet docile
   half-Native American patient at a psychiatric hospital, who presents
   himself as deaf and mute. Bromden's tale focuses mainly on the antics
   of the rebellious Randle Patrick McMurphy, who faked insanity to serve
   his sentence for battery and gambling in the hospital rather than at a
   prison work farm. The head administrative nurse, Nurse Ratched, rules
   the ward with absolute authority and little medical oversight. She is
   assisted by her three day-shift orderlies and her assistant doctors and
   nurses.

   McMurphy constantly antagonizes Nurse Ratched and upsets the routines
   of the ward, leading to endless power struggles between the inmate and
   the nurse. He runs a card table, captains the ward's basketball team,
   comments on Nurse Ratched's figure, incites the other patients to
   conduct a vote about watching the World Series on television, and
   organizes a deep-sea fishing trip wherein the patients were going to be
   "supervised" by prostitutes. After claiming to be able, and
   subsequently failing, to lift a heavy control panel in the defunct
   hydrotherapy room (referred to as the "tub room"), his response--"But
   at least I tried"--gives the men incentive to try to stand up for
   themselves, instead of allowing Nurse Ratched to take control of every
   aspect of their lives. The Chief opens up to McMurphy, revealing late
   one night that he can speak and hear. A violent disturbance after the
   fishing trip results in McMurphy and the Chief being sent for
   electroshock therapy sessions, but such punishment does nothing to curb
   McMurphy's rambunctious behavior.

   One night, after bribing the night orderly, McMurphy smuggles two
   prostitute girlfriends with liquor onto the ward and breaks into the
   pharmacy for codeine cough syrup and unnamed psychiatric medications.
   McMurphy, having noticed on the fishing trip that Billy Bibbit--a
   timid, boyish patient with a stutter and little experience with
   women--had a crush on the prostitute named Candy, primarily arranged
   this break-in so that Billy could lose his virginity and, to a slightly
   lesser extent so that McMurphy and other patients could throw an
   unsanctioned party. Although McMurphy agrees before the end of the
   night to a plan involving his escaping before the morning shift starts,
   he and the other patients instead fall asleep without cleaning up the
   mess of the group's antics, and the morning staff discovers the ward in
   complete disarray. Nurse Ratched finds Billy and the prostitute in each
   other's arms, partially dressed, and admonishes him. Billy asserts
   himself for the first time, answering Nurse Ratched without stuttering.
   Ratched calmly threatens to tell Billy's mother what she has seen.
   Billy has an emotional breakdown, regressing immediately back to a
   boyish state, and, upon being left alone in the doctor's office, takes
   his life by cutting his own throat. Nurse Ratched blames McMurphy for
   the loss of Billy's life. Enraged at what she has done to Billy,
   McMurphy attacks Ratched, sexually assaulting her by ripping her shirt
   open and attempting to strangle her to death. McMurphy is physically
   restrained and moved to the Disturbed ward.

   Nurse Ratched misses a week of work due to her injuries, during which
   time many of the patients either transfer to other wards or check out
   of the hospital forever. When she returns, she cannot speak and is thus
   deprived of her most potent tool to keep the men in line. With Bromden,
   Martini, and Scanlon the only patients who attended the boat trip left
   on the ward, McMurphy is brought back in. He has received a lobotomy,
   and is now in a vegetative state, rendering him silent and motionless.
   The Chief smothers McMurphy with a pillow during the night in an act of
   mercy before lifting the tub room control panel that McMurphy could not
   lift earlier, throwing it through a window and escaping the hospital.
