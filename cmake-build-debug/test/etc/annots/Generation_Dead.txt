   The protagonist of the story is goth teenager Phoebe Kendall who, along
   with her best friends Margi and Adam, attends the fictional Oakvale
   High School. The world in which the story takes place is a strange one,
   with a supernatural phenomenon that causes dead teenagers to wake from
   their graves and move about like regular people--except they don't
   breathe.

   With help from the school's principal, Tommy joins Oakvale High's
   football team. The coach is openly hostile towards him and instructs
   the other players (in particular Pete, his lackeys Stavis and Harris,
   and Adam) to do their utmost to injure him so severely that he can no
   longer play. Adam refuses, and Pete and the others fail. Adam and
   another living boy, Thornton Harrowood, come to accept Tommy, but when
   the team plays their first match, they are harassed by anti-zombie
   protestors. Tommy bargains with the coach, promising to quit as long as
   he can play, however briefly, in the second half of the game.

   The school is also visited by the Hunter Foundation, which aims to
   promote tolerance and understanding of the living impaired. Founders
   Alish and Angela Hunter announce a work and study program open to all
   students, intended to improve relations between traditionally and
   differently biotic people. Phoebe, Margi, Adam and Thornton are the
   only living students to sign up for the class (affectionately referred
   to as 'Undead Studies'), along with their differently biotic classmates
   Tommy, Karen, Evan, Colette, Kevin, Sylvia and Tayshawn. When the class
   list is posted publicly in the school, Pete steals it, planning to go
   after each of the class members in turn.

   It is revealed that Pete's first love, a girl called Julie, died
   suddenly of an asthma attack some time ago and did not 'come back'. As
   a result of this, he harbours a deep bitterness and hatred for all
   differently biotic people, believing them to be unworthy of the second
   chance that Julie was denied. His mental stability is uncertain, since
   he sees hallucinations of Julie semi-frequently and often refers to
   Karen and Phoebe as 'Julie' by mistake.

   Tommy takes Phoebe and Adam to an abandoned house deep in the nearby
   Oxoboxo Woods. A number of the living impaired who were abandoned by
   their families reside there and refer to it as 'The Haunted House'.
   Tommy takes Phoebe upstairs and shows her the 'Wall of the Dead' - a
   wall of photographs of zombie kids from all over the country. He then
   tells her to lie down on the floor in the darkness. When she does, he
   leaves her there for a short time. She becomes frightened and Tommy
   later tells her that now she knows how it feels to be dead.

   Tommy invites Phoebe to his house so he can show her his blog on a
   website called mysocalledundeath.com, which he uses to get in touch
   with other undead teenagers and to campaign for rights for the living
   impaired. Phoebe, knowing that her parents will disapprove of her
   associating with a dead boy, asks Adam and Margi to cover for her. It
   has been established by now that Adam has feelings for Phoebe and is
   unhappy about her developing relationship with Tommy, but he agrees. He
   and Margi visit the Oxoboxo Lake, where Colette drowned a few years
   earlier. When she was alive, Colette was best friends with Phoebe and
   Margi (the three of them being collectively known as 'The Weird
   Sisters') but they haven't spoken since her death, which is a source of
   constant guilt and misery for Margi.

   Soon after in Undead Studies, Colette tells the class about her
   experiences following her return from death. She walked seven miles
   from the morgue to her family home, where her mother screamed at her to
   go away and her father threatened her with a shovel. (The family later
   left Oakvale without Colette.) She then went to a friend's house but
   was turned away again. Margi bursts into tears and protests that she
   was scared, ultimately revealing that this 'friend' was her. She runs
   out of the class, whilst Phoebe stays and reconciles with Colette.
   Margi later refuses to return to the class and is removed from the
   program.

   Meanwhile, all over the country, undead teenagers are being brutally
   'reterminated' (i.e. killed permanently, which involves the irreparable
   destruction of the brain). There are no laws against murdering zombies
   since they are, technically, already dead. Furthermore, since the
   differently biotic are widely shunned by living society, the stories of
   their murders do not even make it into the news. Tommy is constantly
   doing research into the crimes against the undead, and presents his
   findings at each meeting of the Undead Studies class. Many of the
   reterminations seem to involve a mysterious 'white van', suggesting
   that the killings are planned and systematic. Phoebe and the other
   living students are horrified, whilst the undead members of the class
   are unsurprised and seem quite aware that many people would like to see
   them destroyed.

   Phoebe and Tommy finally go out on a date and see a movie, after which
   Tommy asks her to the homecoming dance. He tells her she doesn't have
   to answer straight away, though she later says yes.

   Pete makes his first move against the members of the Undead Studies
   class. His first target is Evan Talbot, a red-headed zombie with a
   sense of humour that Adam is fond of. Pete, with help from Stavis and
   Harris, reterminates Evan using a maul. Adam, who was aware of the
   threats Pete was making towards the living impaired kids, suspects he
   is the perpetrator, and Pete indirectly confirms his suspicions.

   Tommy arranges a meeting at the Haunted House to discuss Evan's murder.
   There, Phoebe and Adam meet Takayuki, a dead boy with a large section
   of his right cheek missing (leading to Adam nicknaming him 'Smiley')
   and a marked dislike for the living. When Adam reveals that it was Pete
   who killed Evan, Tommy announces that they will go to the police with
   the information. Takayuki is disgusted by this, believing that the
   police will do nothing, and he and a few other zombies leave. Tommy and
   Karen then announce their plans to host a party at the Haunted House
   after homecoming, since many of the undead kids will be unable to
   attend the dance. Phoebe feels that Adam was being rude and insensitive
   at the meeting, especially to Takayuki, and they have their first
   argument.

   On the school bus the next day, Margi tells Phoebe that she is coming
   back to Undead Studies. Colette approaches them; Margi apologises to
   her and Colette invites her to the homecoming party at the Haunted
   House. Later, Margi and Phoebe ask Karen how she died and she tells
   them, to their shock, that she committed suicide by taking an overdose.

   The homecoming dance seems to go smoothly, but unbeknownst to Phoebe
   and the others, Pete's next target is Tommy, and he plans on attacking
   him at the after-party (which he found out about by bullying the
   information out of Thornton). He and Stavis (it is mentioned that
   Harris, after assisting in Evan's murder, has refused to be part of
   Pete's schemes any longer) follow the group to the Haunted House. Tommy
   and Phoebe go outside into the woods to talk. Tommy tells her that he
   died in a car crash that also killed his father, and reveals that the
   zombies with the highest level of functionality are the ones who are
   loved by their friends or families even after their deaths. (This
   explains why zombies like Colette, who was abandoned by her family and,
   until recently, ignored by her friends, move and speak so slowly.)
   Tommy states his belief that if he can get a living girl to fall in
   love with him and kiss him, he'll come 'back to life' even more. Phoebe
   has been concerned for a while that Tommy is only interested in her
   because she is alive, and this seems to confirm her fears.

   Pete, who has been watching them, is gripped by a hallucination -
   instead of Phoebe, he sees Julie, and believes that she is about to
   cheat on him with Tommy. He is armed with a gun, which he intended to
   use to shoot Tommy, but instead takes aim at Phoebe.

   Meanwhile, back at the party, Karen advises Adam to tell Phoebe how he
   feels about her. He goes to find her and hears her screams. Following
   the sound, he sees Pete about to shoot. Without hesitation, he throws
   himself into the line of fire and is shot in the chest. Realizing what
   they've done, Stavis and Pete flee the scene. Pete is caught by
   Takayuki, who inflicts an injury on Pete's face similar to his own.

   The screams and gunshot alert the rest of the party-goers to the
   confrontation, and everyone emerges from the Haunted House and gathers
   around Adam while Phoebe cries out at them to help, though she knows
   that Adam is already dead. However, within minutes he returns from
   death, and is at first completely unaware that he was killed. He
   realizes something is wrong when he tries to talk and move as normal
   and finds he can't, and then Phoebe tells him what happened. He tries
   to tell her that he loves her, but manages only an incoherent gurgle.
   When the police and an ambulance finally arrive, Phoebe decides that
   she is going to do everything in her power to bring Adam back as much
   as possible.
