   1919: After surviving the Great War, Major Brendan Archer makes his way
   to Ireland, hoping to discover whether he is indeed betrothed to Angela
   Spencer, whose Anglo-Irish family owns the once-aptly-named Majestic
   Hotel in Kilnalough. But his fiancee is strangely altered and her
   family's fortunes have suffered a spectacular decline. The hotel's
   hundreds of rooms are disintegrating on a grand scale; its few
   remaining guests thrive on rumours and games of whist; herds of cats
   have taken over the Imperial Bar and the upper stories; bamboo shoots
   threaten the foundations; and piglets frolic in the squash court.
   Meanwhile, the Major is captivated by the beautiful and bitter Sarah
   Devlin. As housekeeping disasters force him from room to room, outside
   the order of the British Empire also totters: there is unrest in the
   East, and in Ireland itself the mounting violence of "the troubles."
   

   The novel concerns the arrival of the English Major Archer, recently
   discharged from the British Army, at the Majestic Hotel on the Wexford
   coast in south-east Ireland in 1919. Both the hotel, and the town in
   which it is situated, Kilnalough, are fictional. Archer is convinced he
   is engaged, though sure he had never actually proposed, to Angela
   Spencer, the daughter of Edward Spencer, the owner of the hotel. She
   has written to him since they met in 1916 while on leave from the
   trench warfare of the Western Front.

   The Spencers are an Anglo-Irish Protestant family, strongly Unionist in
   their attitudes towards Ireland's ties to the United Kingdom. Archer
   functions as a confused observer of the dysfunctional Spencer family,
   representing the Anglo-Irish, and the local Catholic population. As the
   novel progresses, social and economic relationships break down,
   mirrored by the gentle decay of the hotel.
