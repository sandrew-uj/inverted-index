   The "Bug Jack Barron" show begins Wednesday evening with an on-air call
   from Rufus W. Johnson, who claims that the Foundation for Human
   Immortality refused to accept his assets as payment for a Freezer
   contract. Rufus accuses the Foundation of being a racist organization,
   unwilling to offer Freezer contracts to African Americans even if they
   have the $500,000 required payment.

   Jack Barron is appalled to hear this and makes several live calls using
   his studio Vidphone to hear all sides of Mr. Johnson's claim. He first
   calls Benedict Howards, but is told that he is unavailable. Jack is
   transferred to John Yarborough, Public Relations Director for the
   Foundation. Barron quickly dismisses Yarborough's counter-claims, and
   then calls the Governor of Mississippi, Lukas Greene. The Governor
   feels the Foundation is not only racist, but destined to abuse rights
   of one kind or another if they succeed in getting their Freezer Utility
   Bill through Congress. Should the bill pass, the Foundation would gain
   monopoly status. To stop this injustice, Greene supports a Public
   Freezer system, open to all Americans.

   Hoping not to anger the FCC (influenced by Benedict Howards and his
   supporters in Congress), Barron calls Senator Theodore Hennering, a
   supporter of Benedict Howards and his Freezer Utility bill. However,
   even though Barron gives the Senator ample chance to defend the
   Foundation and the Utility bill, the Senator appears nervous and does a
   very poor job convincing Barron and his audience that the Foundation is
   not a racist organization.

   The following day, Howards visits Jack in his office. They exchange
   casual threats to destroy each other, after which Howards requests
   Jack's support for his Freezer Utility bill in Congress. Jack is
   insulted by this and refuses, but Howards continues by offering Jack a
   free Freezer Contract and immortal life. Though tempted, Jack refuses
   the bribe. Howards gives Jack more time to think about it, and leaves
   Jack to consider the offer.

   Howards later meets with his head of Personnel Research, to see if they
   can find information of any incidents in Jack Barron's life that can be
   used to either coerce him to cooperate, or to discredit him publicly.
   From that meeting, Howards deduces that Jack and Sara (his ex-wife) are
   still in love. He believes he can exploit that relationship to his
   benefit. Shortly afterwards, Howards calls Sara to his office, where he
   offers her a free Freezer contract if she can get Jack to agree to the
   bribe. Sara is appalled by this. As part of the Social Justice
   Coalition (SJC), she despises Benedict Howards, but suddenly considers
   that it might work in her favor. Her plan is to tell Jack that Howards
   coerced her into service. That fact would infuriate Jack enough to
   destroy Howards, and allow them to rekindle their relationship. Back
   together, Sara dreams about being frozen together with Jack, and being
   revived together after an immortality treatment has been discovered.

   Upon waking up the next morning, Jack Barron receives a call from the
   Governor of California, Gregory Morris. To Jack's utter surprise,
   Morris suggests that Jack consider running as the next President of the
   United States. By having Jack as a candidate, Morris hopes to unify the
   SJC and the Republican party on a single political platform. He feels
   this is the only way to win against the Democratic party, even though
   he personally finds Jack and the SJC repulsive. Jack turns down the
   offer, in a derogatory manner. Even though Jack and Morris trade
   insults, Morris tells Jack to consider the offer.

   After the call, Jack immediately contacts his friend Lukas, and "blips"
   to him (that is, transmits to him as a digitally compressed file) a
   recording of his conversation with Morris. To Jack's horror, Lukas
   actually likes the idea because he too sees the goal envisioned by
   Morris, and thinks Jack will be more than just a figurehead President.

   Jack then gets a call from Sara. She begs him to forgive her. He is
   shocked to hear this at first, but soon agrees to visit her, leaving
   his current girlfriend (who had been with him all night) in tears. Once
   he arrives at Sara's apartment in the East Village, the two argue about
   why they broke up. But they soon reconcile, and Sara enthusiastically
   draws Jack into lovemaking. Together again, they return to his
   penthouse apartment, where Jack hopes to impress her. To some degree,
   Sara is an idealist (still like the girl she was in college) and is not
   impressed with the wealth that Jack has amassed as a celebrity.
   However, her plan to be reunited for eternity with Jack makes her
   tolerate the situation. They make love a second time.

   During his next show, Jack interviews Ms. Dolores Pulaski, a woman
   distraught because her father is dying of terminal cancer. She begs
   Jack to get her father into a Freezer so that he'll have a chance to be
   cured some day, and possibly receive an immortality treatment as well.
   Jack immediately makes an on-air call to Benedict Howards, who ends up
   appearing insensitive during the ensuing conversation. During the
   commercial break, Howards is furious, but concedes to Jack's previous
   demands, as long as Jack allows him to save face. They agree to discuss
   things later in private.

   The next day, Howards visits Jack's office and demands that Jack
   support the Utility Freezer Bill in exchange for a Freezer contract.
   But Jack doesn't trust Howards, and gets him to admit that his
   foundation has already discovered an immortality treatment. Howards
   then agrees to give the same treatment to Jack and Sara, but Jack
   thinks Howards is still hiding something. He asks to know more about
   the treatment, but Howards refuses. In the end, Jack won't sign, but
   Howards says he'll give Jack another twenty-four hours to reconsider.

   While Jack is on his way home, Sara receives a call from Howards. He
   reminds her that she must convince Jack to sign. This angers Sara, and
   makes her feel guilty about keeping secrets. When Jack returns home,
   she admits about being coerced, but asks to be forgiven. With a mutual
   confession of love, Jack and Sara commit themselves to ruining Howards
   together.

   The next day, Howards visits Jack again with new contracts for both
   Jack and Sara to sign. The new contracts not only guarantee being
   frozen, but also the immortality treatment. Howards gloats to himself
   about finally trapping Jack and Sara. Jack cannot see any drawback in
   the contract, and he and Sara agree to sign. Howards then desperately
   attempts to get Jack and Sara to receive their treatment immediately,
   but Jack puts him off, saying he prefers to wait for some time,
   although Sara cannot understand why they should wait.

   Early the next morning, Jack receives a call from Madge Hennering, the
   wife of the Senator who supported Howards. Senator Hennering had died
   since his last conversation with Jack, and his widow, very distraught,
   tells Jack that her husband had a bitter fight with Howards just prior
   to his death. She is convinced that her husband found out something
   terrible about the Foundation, and was killed by Howards to stop him
   from telling anyone. She begs Jack to help, but he refuses to believe
   her story.

   On the next broadcast of "Bug Jack Barron", a man named Henry George
   Franklin calls in and complains that he sold his young daughter to some
   wealthy men for $50,000. Even though the men promised to provide his
   daughter with a better life, Henry claims he was duped, and wants Jack
   to help him get his daughter back. Jack finds Mr. Franklin's plea
   contemptible, and quickly cuts him off. After the show, Jack feels that
   that episode wasn't very good, but changes his mind after a call soon
   arrives from Howards. Howards is furious that Franklin was on the show,
   and threateningly tells Jack to abandon the story altogether. Jack
   can't understand how Henry George Franklin can be a threat to Howards,
   and angrily tells Howards to back off.

   Intrigued by Howards's reaction, Jack flies to Evers, Mississippi,
   hoping to meet Franklin and speak with him. Jack was hoping to go alone
   and keep a low profile, but his plans are ruined by Lukas Greene, who
   stages a political rally at the airport as a prelude to Jack's
   presidential run. Jack is upset, but leaves the airport with Lukas by
   limo, where Jack accuses Greene of selling out. Greene doesn't listen,
   and says again that Jack is a good man, and can help the country by
   running for president.

   Unwilling to meet Franklin at the governor's mansion, Jack goes to see
   him in a restaurant in a low-income neighborhood. Franklin is happy to
   see Jack, but Jack finds Franklin just as contemptible in person.
   Still, there is a mystery about the whole incident, and Barron agrees
   to help somehow. They start by walking to the governor's mansion, when
   a sniper kills Franklin. The sniper attempts to shoot Jack as well, but
   he escapes unharmed due to the help of the local police. Jack tells the
   police he doesn't know who tried to kill him, but quickly deduces that
   Benedict Howards must have been behind the shooting. With that
   assumption, Jack realizes that the Foundation must also be responsible
   for buying Franklin's daughter. Jack later confirms his suspicion by
   using computer records to search for other children who are now
   missing.

   Upon his return home, Jack shares all his suspicions with Sara. They
   both assume Howards is responsible for the deaths of Hennering and
   Franklin. In addition, Jack believes the Foundation is buying young
   black children for some reason. To get to the bottom of the mystery,
   Jack unveils a plan. He and Sara will receive their immortality
   treatment, and make Howards think he really has them trapped. Then when
   Howards admits to all his crimes, Jack will use a concealed very small
   portable telephone to record the confession. Sara agrees, and is
   impressed by Jack's risk-taking attitude. The two celebrate by having
   oral sex.

   The next day, Jack and Sara go to Benedict Howards's office, agree to
   get the treatment immediately, and trap him into admitting that he
   actually was responsible for the murders. However, Howards does not get
   angered from this and proceeds with the treatment. When the treatment
   is over and Jack and Sara wake up in the hospital, Howards explains
   Jack that the treatment is, in essence, transplantation of glands of
   children (the children that were abducted) to the persons that get it
   and that the children are being killed off by very strong and fatal
   radiation. Jack is appalled by this and realizes that this is why
   Howards killed Hennering; he obviously found out about the children.
   When he confronts Howards, Howards, threatens him that he will suborn
   witnesses to testify that Jack and Sara knew everything about the
   treatment, meaning that he and Sara will also be charged with murder
   and will be executed (e.g. no immortality) as well; that is, in the
   case that Jack make a move against Howards.

   Jack and Sara return home where he reveals to her the truth about the
   children and that he will support the Foundation in his next shows.
   When he actually goes to the show, he gets a call from Sara, who
   commits suicide in order to change his mind about the show. Jack, now
   gone mad, reveals the truth during the show, while Howards goes
   paranoid on air, threatening to kill him. Jack, then, begs the viewers
   to believe that he didn't know anything about the children beforehand.

   Eventually, Jack does run for President, planning to give his position
   to future Vice-President Lukas Green, who is black, after his election.
