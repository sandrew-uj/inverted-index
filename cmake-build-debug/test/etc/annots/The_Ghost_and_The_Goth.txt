   Alona Dare was the most popular girl in school, at least she was until
   she was hit by a bus. Returning to the scene of her death as a ghost,
   she expects everyone to be upset over her death, but her classmates
   move on faster than she had hoped. The only person that can see and
   hear her is Will Killian, the school outcast and ghost-talker. Alona,
   used to getting her own way, haunts Will until he agrees to help her
   figure out how to cross over to the big white light that she keeps
   expecting. Will has problems of his own; every ghost in Groundsboro
   High, including a seething black mass of energy, knows that he can see
   them, and they all want him to carry out their final wishes. Will and
   Alona have to work together to get the ghosts to move on, and figure
   out what Alona has to do in order to move on to the white light.
