   Divergent is a series of young adult science fiction adventure novels
   by American novelist Veronica Roth set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian
   Chicago.^[1] The trilogy consists of Divergent (2011), Insurgent (2012)
   and Allegiant (2013).^[2]^[3] A related book, Four (2014), presents a
   series of short stories told from the perspective of one of the
   trilogy's characters, the male love interest Four. A later short story,
   We Can Be Mended (2018), serves as an epilogue five years after the
   events of the trilogy, again from Four's perspective.

   The trilogy is set in the future in a scientific/divergent society that
   is divided into five factions. The series society defines its citizens
   by their social and personality affiliations, with the five different
   factions removing the threat of anyone exercising independent will and
   threatening the population's safety. Beatrice Prior, who later changes
   her name to Tris, is born into Abnegation but transfers into Dauntless;
   she must figure out her life as a Divergent, conceal her true nature,
   and live with the danger of being killed if her true nature is
   discovered by the Erudite and Dauntless alphas.^[4]
