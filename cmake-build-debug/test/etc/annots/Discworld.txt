   Discworld is a comic fantasy^[1] book series written by the English
   author Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on
   the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant
   turtle. The series began in 1983 with The Colour of Magic and continued
   until the final novel The Shepherd's Crown, which was published in
   2015, following Pratchett's death. The books frequently parody or take
   inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft,
   Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore
   and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with
   cultural, political and scientific issues.^[citation needed]

   Forty-one Discworld novels have been published. Apart from the first
   novel in the series, The Colour of Magic, the original British editions
   of the first 26 novels, up to Thief of Time (2001), had cover art by
   Josh Kirby. After Kirby's death in 2001, the covers were designed by
   Paul Kidby. The American editions, published by HarperCollins, used
   their own cover art. Companion publications include eleven short
   stories (some only loosely related to the Discworld), four popular
   science books, and a number of supplementary books and reference
   guides. The series has been adapted for graphic novels, theatre,
   computer and board games, and television.

   Discworld books regularly topped Sunday Times best-sellers list, making
   Pratchett the UK's best-selling author in the 1990s. Discworld novels
   have also won awards such as the Prometheus Award and the Carnegie
   Medal. In the BBC's Big Read, four Discworld novels were in the top
   100, and a total of fourteen in the top 200. More than 80 million
   Discworld books have been sold in 37 languages.^[2]^[3]
