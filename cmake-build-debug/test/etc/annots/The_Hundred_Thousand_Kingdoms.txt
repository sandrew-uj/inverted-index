   Yeine Darr was born to Kinneth Arameri, who was heir to the Arameri
   throne but abdicated twenty years before the start of the story to
   marry Yeine's father, a Darre man. Kinneth was disowned by Dekarta, and
   Darr blacklisted by the Arameri (throwing the country into a crippling
   economic crisis) as a result.

   The day she arrives, she meets T'vril, the palace steward, who is also
   an Arameri (although lower-ranked); the entire palace staff down to the
   floor cleaning servants is Arameri. This is because only Arameri are
   permitted to pass a night in Sky, for reasons that T'vril does not
   immediately explain. T'vril attempts to get Yeine to Viraine--the
   palace scrivener--to be "marked" as an Arameri before nightfall.
   However, Scimina, one of the other potential heirs, finds them first.
   Because Yeine lacks the mark, she unleashes Nahadoth, one of the
   Arameri's captive gods, on Yeine.

   Yeine flees and is assisted by Sieh, another of the captive gods.
   Before they can escape, Nahadoth catches up and attacks Sieh, whereupon
   Yeine stabs Nahadoth to apparent death with her knife. Nahadoth kisses
   her before he falls, saying he has been waiting for her, much to
   Yeine's confusion. Being a god, Nahadoth returns to life shortly
   afterward. Yeine then meets the other gods--and quickly realizes that
   they, like the Arameri, have frightening plans for her.

   Yeine, however, has her own agenda: still in mourning, she has come to
   Sky to determine who may have killed her mother before the start of the
   story. While attempting to forge an alliance with Relad, her cousin and
   the other potential heir, she also seeks out answers to the mystery of
   her mother's past. This leads Yeine to terrifying revelations about
   herself, her world's history, and the gods themselves.

   As the day of the succession ceremony approaches and Yeine finds
   herself left with few options, she chooses to ally with the
   Enefadeh--even though Nahadoth warns her that they want her life in
   exchange for their assistance. Determined to learn the truth about her
   mother even if she dies in the process, she agrees to the gods'
   bargain. She also begins brief liaisons with first T'vril, then
   Nahadoth himself, the latter of whom seems equally drawn to her, though
   his motives are unclear.

   The story culminates with the Arameri Ceremony of the Succession, at
   which Itempas himself--the Skyfather, ruler of the universe--appears,
   and Yeine makes a fateful choice.
