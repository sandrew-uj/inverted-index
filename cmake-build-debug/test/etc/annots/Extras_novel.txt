   Aya Fuse is a 15-year-old girl living in the futuristic city of
   Yokohama. One night, accompanied by her hovercam Moggle, she crashes a
   party in New Pretty Town hoping to track down a group she saw surfing a
   mag-lev train, a story which she believes will make her famous. She
   follows one of the group's members, Eden Maru, out of the party, but
   they nearly get away when she is distracted by Frizz Mizuno, a more
   beautiful and far more famous person who compliments Aya. Aya leaves
   without telling Frizz her full name, because she is embarrassed by her
   comparatively low face rank. She then follows Eden into a cave, where
   she is ambushed by the mag-lev riders, who call themselves the Sly
   Girls. The group's leader Lai gives Aya a chance to join them, but to
   do so she is forced to drop Moggle into an underground lake.

   The next day, she visits her famous brother Hiro in New Pretty Town,
   another kicker who is celebrating reaching the "top thousand" - a list
   of the thousand most famous people in the city. Hiro and his friend Ren
   Machino refuse to believe Aya's tale of the Sly Girls, who are an urban
   legend in the city, but Ren, who designed Moggle, agrees to help Aya
   retrieve him. Aya also happens upon a story about Frizz, discovering
   that he started a clique based around a brain surgery called Radical
   Honesty, which enforces honesty and makes a person unable to lie. That
   evening, Aya goes mag-lev surfing with the Sly Girls, enjoying the
   experience in spite of not having a camera to film it with. During the
   journey, the girls are surprised when the train stops, and they see
   inhuman figures loading the train up with a variety of items hidden
   within a secret underground room.

   Aya retrieves Moggle, and uses him to film her next excursion with the
   Sly Girls, a mag-lev surfing trip which ends in exploration of the
   underground room they had discovered. Inside are many large cylinders
   of metal, and a large chute leading to the top of the mountain, neither
   of which are understood by the Sly Girls. They plan to return to
   explore further, but Aya's credibility is ruined by the kicking of a
   news story about Frizz Mizuno coming to talk to her by her dorm. Aya is
   forced to break off contact with Frizz in order to lose fame, which the
   Sly Girls despise, and the story leaves her disillusioned by the
   hateful comments of the kickers. However, she does have the chance to
   tell Hiro and Ren about the Sly Girls story, and from her description
   Ren guesses that the chute inside the mountain is a mass driver which,
   combined with the steel projectiles, could be used to launch an attack
   on the city.

   When Aya next meets the Sly Girls, they reveal that they knew she was a
   kicker, and have decided to allow her to kick the story of the mass
   driver in spite of their hatred of fame. They launch themselves and Aya
   out of the mass driver with homemade parachutes, giving her one last
   thrill before they part ways, and also giving themselves time to move
   on to a different city. Aya kicks her story and becomes instantly
   famous, but is concerned when she receives a message from Tally
   Youngblood telling her to "run and hide", and is nearly captured by the
   inhumans while trying to do so. Eventually, Aya uses her fame to take
   control of a high-security apartment, and waits there until Tally
   arrives, accompanied by Shay and Fausto.

   After talking, the Cutters (Tally, Shay, and Fausto) go hoverboarding
   with Aya, Hiro, Frizz and Ren. Aya has a signal up for her hovercam,
   and the Cutters boost it so the inhumans could find them. They are soon
   captured, and on the inhumans' ship headed for a camp outside of the
   rusty ruins of Singapore. Frizz ruins their plan due to his Radical
   Honesty, so the Cutters knock out the inhumans and put the hovercar on
   autopilot, where more inhumans wait. The Cutters, Aya, Frizz, Hiro, and
   Ren jump out of the hovercar, not wanting to meet more inhumans. Soon,
   they have to travel through a jungle to meet David.

   After deciding Aya, Ren, Hiro, and Frizz would get in the way, Tally,
   Shay, and Fausto plan to leave them where they were. Meanwhile, they,
   the Cutters, would go to destroy the ships of the inhumans. After they
   have left, Aya says that she is going as well. Ren, Hiro, and Frizz
   come with her. Soon, they are caught by the inhumans, and meet Andrew
   Simpson Smith, who mistakes Aya for Tally. The inhumans (calling
   themselves Extras) explain they are using the metal for two things; the
   first is to stop the human expansion, the second to build
   space-stations and rockets so that humans can start living in space as
   an answer to environmental problems. Soon, everyone is working together
   to stop the fire Shay and Tally started.

   Mystery solved, Aya, Frizz, Hiro, and Ren all become global
   celebrities. Aya especially benefits and becomes the 3rd most famous
   person in Yokohama after kicking a story about the Extras,
   appropriately called "Leaving Home". Aya, her friends, and the Cutters
   go to a party for only the most famous people in Yokohama, The Thousand
   Faces Party. There, Aya met Lai, the Sly Girls' leader. Lai tells Aya
   that the cake will explode (non-lethally) when it is cut, and makes Aya
   promise not to tell anyone. After, Frizz tells Aya that he might leave
   Radical Honesty, deciding he didn't need the group to tell the truth.
   Aya and Frizz watch Tally and David escape from the party on a balcony
   before going to watch (and possibly film) the cutting of the cake.
