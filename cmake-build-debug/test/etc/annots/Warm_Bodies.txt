   In a post-apocalyptic future, a male zombie still in the early stages
   of decay lives in a community of the dead in an abandoned airport near
   the city. He cannot remember his name, and refers to himself as "R".
   After the collapse of human civilization, zombies hunt for the living,
   seeking to eat their brains; doing so allows them to relive the
   memories, feelings, and thoughts of their prey. Zombies whose flesh has
   completely decayed away are known as "Boneys", which act as "pack
   leaders" of sorts to the others, who are known as "Fleshies" and still
   retain traces and behaviors from their previous lives as humans, though
   R explains that most of the behaviors are done out of force of habit
   rather than an attempt to "live". R, a Fleshy, is unusual as he shows
   distaste for eating human flesh, and can form several coherent
   syllables in one breath, and collects various objects from the outside
   world that he hoards in his "house", a Boeing 747 airliner parked at
   the airport.

   In a hunt, R feeds on the brain of a young man named Perry. After
   experiencing his memories, R sees Perry's girlfriend Julie, and in a
   moment of mercy, saves her from the others. He disguises her scent with
   zombie blood, and takes her home where he hides her in the 747
   airplane. He slowly gains Julie's trust, and convinces her to stay for
   a while until the others forget about her. R feeds her food from the
   airport's restaurant, entertains her with his treasures, including a
   record player, and Julie tries to teach him to drive a car which R has
   managed to get started. She also tells him a little bit about her life.
   In time, R begins feeling guilty over killing Perry, but continues to
   eat the remains of his brain, seeing it as a rare treasure, and
   experiences many of Perry's memories.

   Julie is attacked by several zombies, and R helps her fend them off.
   His fellow zombie M is confused and angered by his behavior, but
   relents his attack. However, several Boneys, attracted by the noise,
   arrive, and one of them shows R some old photos of the dead and living
   fighting each other, telling him that they need to maintain the status
   quo. They leave along with the rest, and R takes Julie back to the
   airplane. In the morning, Julie convinces R to take her home, and they
   leave while the dead watch them. The Boneys attack and try to kill
   Julie, but with M's help, they get away in R's car. On the way to the
   city, they camp out in a suburban house, and Julie allows R to share a
   bed with her. The next morning, Julie calls her father, and sends R out
   for fuel. When he returns, Julie is gone. R begins walking back to the
   airport in a heavy rainstorm, and feels cold for the first time since
   he "died". On the road, R runs into M and some other zombies who have
   been chased out by the Boneys. M explains that, ever since the
   confrontation with the Boneys in the airport, the zombies have been
   changing like R, and experiencing things such as dreams and old
   memories. R decides to go after Julie, and follows her scent to an
   abandoned stadium converted into a large community for human survivors,
   led by Julie's father Grigio. After disguising himself as a human, R
   locates Julie's house and sees her on her balcony, and they reunite. R
   has further visions of Perry's memory; some form of Perry's soul is
   living inside R, and has intertwined with R's own. He also realizes
   that Perry and Julie had started to become distant from each other
   shortly before Perry's death, largely due to Perry beginning to lose
   his will to live.

   During a party in the community, R becomes intoxicated, and, no longer
   able to control his zombie instincts, attacks a guard, infecting him
   and causing a small outbreak in the stadium. Grigio discovers R, and,
   deducing what he is, attacks him despite Julie's protests, but is
   stopped by Julie's friend Nora, allowing Julie and R to escape.
   Outside, the crowd of zombies has grown. What Julie and R have between
   them has infected many others, causing them to change and seek to
   regain their humanity. However, as they deliberate on what to do next,
   the Boneys attack both the Living and Fleshies alike. The couple meets
   up with Nora, and they flee to a roof where they see the battle between
   the Boneys and the Living. As they watch, Julie has an epiphany: the
   plague started because the human race crushed itself beneath the weight
   of its negative emotions, until it released a dark force that changed
   the humans so that everyone could see their evil. In the midst of the
   chaos and bloodshed, R and Julie kiss; the strength of their love cures
   R of the plague completely and both their eyes turn gold. Grigio, not
   believing that a cure for the plague exists and thinking that R has
   infected Julie, attempts to kill them both, but is stopped by one of
   his own soldiers and attacked by a Boney. As Julie shoots the Boney,
   both it and Grigio fall off the roof of the stadium shriveling into
   dust and bones. The action apparently causes the rest of the Boneys to
   flee, and the battle ends with the Living and Dead establishing peace.
   The epilogue reveals that in the aftermath of the battle, the word
   about the origins of the plague was spread among the other surviving
   communities, allowing for a true chance at a cure, and R looks forward
   to what the future now brings, for the Living and the Dead both.
