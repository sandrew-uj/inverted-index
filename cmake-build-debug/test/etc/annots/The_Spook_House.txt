   In 1858, an entire family of seven persons disappears suddenly and
   unaccountably from a plantation house in eastern Kentucky, leaving all
   its possessions untouched -- furniture, clothing, food supplies,
   horses, cattle, and slaves.

   About a year later, two men of high standing are forced by a storm to
   take shelter in the deserted dwelling, and in doing so, they stumble
   into a supernatural room lit by an unaccountable greenish light and
   having an iron door which cannot be opened from within. In this room
   lie the decayed corpses of all the missing family; and as one of the
   discoverers rushes forward to embrace a body he seems to recognise, the
   other is so overpowered by a putrid odor that he accidentally shuts his
   companion in the vault and loses consciousness.

   Recovering his senses six weeks later, the survivor is unable to find
   the hidden room; and the house is burned during the Civil War. The
   imprisoned discoverer is never seen or heard of again.
