   The Dark Artifices is a trilogy written by Cassandra Clare. The series
   is chronologically the fourth series in The Shadowhunter Chronicles and
   a sequel to The Mortal Instruments. It is set in Los Angeles. The
   series consists of three books: Lady Midnight, Lord of Shadows and
   Queen of Air and Darkness, in that particular order. Centered around
   the protagonist, Emma Carstairs, the series follows her journey as a
   Shadowhunter at the Los Angeles Institute, and her life with her
   best-friend and parabatai, Julian Blackthorn, and his family. The
   series is about a sacred bond of "parabatai", two bonded Shadowhunters,
   and it is more valuable than any bond in this world. This bond makes
   the two more powerful and strong, but there is only one drawback - it
   is forbidden to fall in love with your parabatai. It so happens that
   Emma and Julian, two parabatai, have fallen in love. The Dark Artifices
   is a trilogy about their struggle against their enemies and how the two
   protagonists deal with their forbidden love and the resulting
   consequences. The series is told from the point-of-view of the various
   different characters in the story.
