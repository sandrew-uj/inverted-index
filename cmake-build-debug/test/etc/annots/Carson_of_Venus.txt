   Carson of Venus is a science fantasy novel by American writer Edgar
   Rice Burroughs, the third book in the Venus series (Sometimes called
   the "Carson Napier of Venus series"). Burroughs wrote the novel in July
   and August 1937. It was serialized in 1938 in six weekly installments
   from January 8 to February 12 in Argosy, the same publication where the
   previous two Venus novels appeared. It was published in book form a
   year later from Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. Burroughs originally
   submitted the novel to a number of the "slick" magazines: Liberty, The
   Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, and Ladies' Home Journal. All
   rejected the story.^[1]

   The novel, which was written two years before the outbreak of World War
   II, satirizes Nazi Germany by including a fascist political faction
   called the "Zani". There is also a character named "Muso" as a
   reference to Benito Mussolini. Unlike the first two Venus novels,
   Carson of Venus focuses on spy intrigue and war instead of wilderness
   adventuring.^[2] It also indicates a change of political orientation
   from that of the earlier books, where the villains were modeled on
   Russian Communists.

   Carson of Venus was nominated for a Retro Hugo Award for best science
   fiction novel of 1939. The award went to T. H. White's The Sword in the
   Stone.
