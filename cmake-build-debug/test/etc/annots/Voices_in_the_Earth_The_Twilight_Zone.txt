   Donald Knowles is a professor and joint commander of an expedition team
   who returns to a barren Earth 1,000 years after all life has been
   destroyed by an unspecified disaster. His fellow commander Jacinda
   Carlyle is only interested in finding whatever resources are left on
   the planet. Knowles has four days to explore before mining ships come
   to strip the planet of resources. As Knowles explores the ruins of the
   planet he proceeds to play an old CD player. As Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9
   No. 2 begins, Knowles is confronted by ghosts of the planet. He finds
   them in an abandoned cafe where they ask him not to forget their
   existence. Knowles pleads with Carlyle not to strip the planet but she
   insists upon it anyway.

   Knowles soon discovers that the ghosts are spirits of the forefathers
   who had not left the Earth when life began dissolving. They believe
   that humans are coming back to repopulate the planet, but Knowles
   explains why they are really there. He tries to get them to leave the
   planet, but they say they cannot leave on conventional ships because of
   how they warp space in a way that makes it impossible for them to
   survive the trip. They then plead with him not to let the others dig
   and destroy what remains of the planet in their search for valuable
   minerals. Carlyle continues to ignore him until he takes her to the
   cafe to hear the voices for herself. However, they refuse to speak and
   Carlyle concludes that he is going insane. Later, the specters try to
   possess Knowles and force him to destroy the mission, but Carlyle and
   the other crew members stop him, believing he is doing it of his own
   free will. Carlyle, feeling sorry for her friend, does not report it
   and gives him medical leave.

   Knowles returns to the cafe to confront the ghosts. They tell him he is
   their only hope of leaving. By channeling through him they can live
   although the procedure may not work. He angrily refuses and says that
   it was their fault the Earth was destroyed. When they claim that there
   is nothing else to be done, Knowles reminds them that if they were able
   to change the methane to oxygen to allow him to breathe without a
   spacesuit, surely they could change the planet into a living world
   again. They claim they may not be able to do so without losing their
   life-force in the process. He calls them cowards for not trying and
   without a response he returns to the ship. Suddenly, a miracle occurs:
   it begins raining, restoring the biosphere. The first stages of life
   are discovered in the oceans. Evolution is accelerated, returning Earth
   to a living planet once again. Knowles steps outside and--not knowing
   if they can hear him or not--calls out that one day they will be back.
