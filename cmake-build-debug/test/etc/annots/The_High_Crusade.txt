   It is 1345, and in the English town of Ansby (in northeastern
   Lincolnshire), Sir Roger, Baron de Tourneville, is recruiting a
   military force to assist king Edward III in the Hundred Years' War
   against France. Suddenly, an enormous silver spacecraft lands outside
   the town. It is a scouting craft for the Wersgorix Empire, a brutal
   dominion light years from our solar system. The Wersgorix attempt to
   take over Earth by testing the feasibility of its colonization.
   However, the aliens, having forgotten hand-to-hand combat since it was
   made obsolete by their advanced technology, are caught off-guard by the
   angered Englishmen, who mistake the craft for a French trick. The
   villagers and soldiers in Ansby storm the craft and kill all but one
   Wersgor, Branithar.

   Sir Roger formulates a plan that with the captured ship, he can take
   the entire village to France to win the war, and then liberate the Holy
   Land. The townspeople, with all of their belongings, board the ship at
   the baron's instruction, and prepare to take off. The people of Ansby
   are mystified at the advanced technology aboard the ship, which they
   come to call the Crusader. Being unable to pilot the Crusader Sir Roger
   directs the surly Branithar to pilot them to France. Instead, the alien
   wrecks the baron's plan by throwing the Crusader into autopilot on
   course to Tharixan, another Wersgor colony.

   The Crusader arrives at Tharixan in days, and Sir Roger learns of this
   new world: it is sparsely-populated, with only three fortresses,
   Ganturath, Stularax, and Darova (the chief base). The humans capture
   Ganturath but destroy the Crusader in the process. Word spreads of the
   invaders and a meeting is arranged between Sir Roger and his soldiers
   and the chief of Tharixan, Huruga.

   The humans and Wersgor hold talks that do very little to give either
   side any advantage, but a truce is agreed to. Sir Roger, in order to
   intimidate the aliens, makes up tall tales about his estate, "which
   only took up three planets" and his other accomplishments, including a
   very successful conquest of Constantinople. Sir Roger demands that the
   entire Wersgorix state submit to the king of England. During the talks,
   Baron de Tourneville ignores the truce, and orders the capture of the
   fortress of Stularax. Unfortunately, the entire base is obliterated by
   an atomic bomb. In retaliation, Huruga attacks Ganturath again, but
   loses. He is forced to give up.

   Now comes Sir Roger's most outrageous plan; having captured Tharixan,
   he sets out to overthrow the Wersgorix Empire itself. He enlists the
   help of three other races oppressed by the Wersgor: the Jairs, the
   Ashenkoghli, and the Pr?*tans.

   Meanwhile, one of his main soldiers and friend, Sir Owain Montbelle,
   hatches a plan to return to Earth, something that Sir Roger has lost
   interest in. With Lady Catherine, Sir Roger's wife, Montbelle corners
   the baron and demands that he help the people of Ansby get back to
   Earth. De Tourneville gives in, but attacks Sir Owain in person. At the
   climax, Lady Catherine betrays Montbelle and kills him herself.
   Unfortunately, she also destroys the notes that could have helped get
   the villagers of Ansby back home.

   Sir Roger goes on to topple the Wersgor Empire and build one for
   himself. He manages with the help of not only the species under the
   Wersgor, but from members of the Wersgor race who rebelled against
   their government. The religious figures in the story go on to establish
   a new branch of the Roman Catholic Church.
