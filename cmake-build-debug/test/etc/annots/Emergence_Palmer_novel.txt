   Candidia Maria Smith-Foster, an eleven-year-old girl, is unaware that
   she is a Homo post hominem, mankind's next evolutionary step. Hominems
   have higher IQs, they're stronger, faster, more resistant to illness
   and trauma, and have quicker reflexes. Their eyesight, hearing, and
   sense of smell are superior as well.

   By the time the narrative opens, Candy has acquired a high school
   education, some college, and learned karate, having achieved her Fifth
   Degree Black Belt from her neighbor, 73-year-old Soo Kim McDivott, who
   she is led to believe is merely a retired schoolteacher. McDivott, whom
   she calls "Teacher", is actually the discoverer of the H. post hominem
   species, and has identified and continues to mentor and lead a group of
   them, the AAs. As part of her karate training, she has learned to
   release her hysterical strength, which permits brief bursts of nearly
   superhuman activity.

   With international relations rapidly deteriorating, Candy's father,
   publicly a small-town pathologist but secretly a government biowarfare
   expert, is called to Washington. Candy remains at home.

   The following day a worldwide attack, featuring a bionuclear plague,
   wipes out virtually all of humanity (i.e., Homo sapiens). With pet bird
   Terry, a Hyacinthine macaw, her "lifelong retarded, adopted twin
   brother," who tends to "parrot" Candy's words even before she speaks,
   she survives the attack in the shelter beneath their house. Emerging
   three months later, she learns of her genetic heritage and sets off to
   search for others of her kind.

   First the hunt turns up "Adam", a cheeky, irrepressibly punning,
   multitalented 13-year-old boy, who immediately sets out to win Candy's
   heart; next, Rollo Jones, a middle-aged physician with a broad history
   of survival-in-the-wilds experience ranging from a stint in the Peace
   Corps to mountain climbing; and finally, Kim Melon, an early-20s mom
   whose background is in computer engineering with Lisa, her six-year-old
   daughter. Rollo reveals himself as a sociopath, whom Candy is forced to
   kill defending Terry and herself. Adam, Kim, and Lisa join Candy's
   quest for the AA community. As part of the search, Adam reveals that he
   is an ultralight aircraft pilot. Later he teaches Candy to fly.

   Thereafter, an ultralight engine failure separates Candy from the
   others. After getting it running again, she spots a contrail, which
   leads her to Vandenberg Space Shuttle Launch Complex, where Teacher and
   the AAs are laboring to preflight a shuttle, renamed the Nathan Hale.
   They have identified those who wiped out mankind, the Bratstvo,
   translated as the "Brotherhood", a cabal of H. sapiens, working from
   inside the Russian military to destroy all H. post hominems. As
   insurance, they have placed a doomsday device in geosynchronous orbit,
   a Strontium-90 bomb whose fallout will render Earth uninhabitable for
   200 years.

   At this point, however, the AAs' plans have come unstuck: They have
   modified the Hale to reach geosynch orbit, though it is a one-way,
   suicide voyage for the crew; but the miniature robot handler they have
   built to penetrate the bomb-carrying rocket and disarm the doomsday
   device is not up to the task. Candy realizes, with her small size and
   hysterical strength training, she is the only one who can get inside
   the warhead chamber and disarm the bomb. Despite the fact that it is a
   suicide mission, she volunteers.

   Meanwhile, as Adam, Kim, and Lisa search for Candy, Terry begins
   relaying her thoughts, though initially they do not realize that is
   what they're hearing.

   Arriving in orbit, Kyril Svetlanov, thought to be a Bratstvo defector,
   kills Harris Gilbert, the mission commander. Kyril turns out to have
   been a double agent, whose job ultimately was to sabotage the mission,
   but he does not know about Candy's karate skills. She breaks his neck
   and assumes responsibility for completing the mission.

   Navigating across to the bomb-carrying rocket in a spacesuit, she
   disables the warhead. Then she resets the navigational computer to land
   on the dry lake at Edwards Air Force Base and tries to secure herself
   against a bulkhead in preparation for the stresses of reentry.

   As the missile begins to power-up for reentry, Adam finally realizes
   Terry is in fact relaying Candy's thoughts; that somehow she is in fact
   in space, about to attempt reentry in a non-human-rated vehicle, and
   that she'll soon be landing at Edwards. He, Kim, and Lisa arrive as the
   missile is touching down, just in time to extract her, resuscitate her,
   and treat her injuries.

   The author has left a number of threads trailing at the conclusion,
   some of which are followed-up on 25 years later in a sequel entitled
   Tracking, serialized in Analog Science and Fact magazine in the summer
   and fall of 2008.
