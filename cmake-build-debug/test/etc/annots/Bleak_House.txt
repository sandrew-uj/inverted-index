   Jarndyce and Jarndyce is an interminable law case in the Court of
   Chancery, concerning two or more wills and the beneficiaries of them.
   Bleak House

   Sir Leicester Dedlock and his wife Honoria live on his estate at
   Chesney Wold. Lady Dedlock is a beneficiary under one of the wills.
   While listening to the reading by the family solicitor, Mr Tulkinghorn,
   of an affidavit, she recognises the handwriting on the copy. The sight
   affects her so much she almost faints, which Mr Tulkinghorn notices and
   investigates. He traces the copyist, a pauper known only as "Nemo", in
   London. Nemo has recently died, and the only person to identify him is
   a street-sweeper, a poor homeless boy named Jo, who lives in a
   particularly grim and poverty-stricken part of the city known as
   Tom-All-Alone's ("Nemo" is Latin for "nobody").
   Consecrated ground

   Esther Summerson is raised by the harsh Miss Barbary, who tells her
   "Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers". After Miss
   Barbary dies, John Jarndyce becomes Esther's guardian and assigns the
   Chancery lawyer "Conversation" Kenge to take charge of her future.
   After attending school for six years, Esther moves in with him at his
   home, Bleak House. Jarndyce simultaneously assumes custody of two other
   wards, Richard Carstone and Ada Clare (who are both his and one
   another's distant cousins). They are beneficiaries in one of the wills
   at issue in Jarndyce and Jarndyce; their guardian is a beneficiary
   under another will, and the two wills conflict. Richard and Ada soon
   fall in love, but though Mr Jarndyce does not oppose the match, he
   stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession. Richard first
   tries a career in medicine, and Esther meets Allan Woodcourt, a
   physician, at the house of Richard's tutor. When Richard mentions the
   prospect of gaining from the resolution of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, John
   Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls "the family
   curse". Richard decides to change his career to law. He later switches
   again and spends the remainder of his funds to buy a commission as a
   military officer.

   Lady Dedlock is also investigating the copyist, disguised as her maid,
   Mademoiselle Hortense. Lady Dedlock pays Jo to take her to Nemo's
   grave. Meanwhile, Mr Tulkinghorn is concerned Lady Dedlock has a secret
   which could threaten the interests of Sir Leicester and he watches her
   constantly, even enlisting her maid to spy on her. He also enlists
   Inspector Bucket to run Jo out of town, to eliminate anything that
   might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks.

   Esther sees Lady Dedlock at church and talks with her later at Chesney
   Wold. Lady Dedlock discovers that Esther is her own child: unknown to
   Sir Leicester, before she married Honoria had a lover, Captain Hawdon
   (Nemo), and had a daughter by him who she had believed was dead. The
   daughter, Esther, was brought up by Honoria's sister, Miss Barbary.

   Esther becomes sick (possibly with smallpox, since it severely
   disfigures her) after nursing the homeless boy Jo. Lady Dedlock waits
   until Esther has recovered before telling her the truth. Though Esther
   and Lady Dedlock are happy to be reunited, Lady Dedlock tells Esther
   they must never acknowledge their connection again.

   Upon her recovery, Esther finds that Richard, having failed at several
   professions, has ignored his guardian's advice and is trying to push
   Jarndyce and Jarndyce to conclusion in his and Ada's favour, and has
   fallen out with John Jarndyce. In the process, Richard loses all his
   money and declines in health. He and Ada have secretly married, and Ada
   is pregnant. Esther has her own romance when Mr Woodcourt returns to
   England, having survived a shipwreck, and he continues to seek her
   company despite her disfigurement. However, Esther has already agreed
   to marry her guardian, the much older John Jarndyce.

   Mademoiselle Hortense and Mr Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady
   Dedlock's past. After a confrontation with Mr Tulkinghorn, Lady Dedlock
   flees her home, leaving a note apologising to Sir Leicester for her
   conduct. Mr Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense, who is no longer of any use
   to him. Mr Tulkinghorn is shot through the heart, and suspicion falls
   on Lady Dedlock. Sir Leicester, discovering his lawyer's death and his
   wife's confession and flight, suffers a catastrophic stroke, but he
   manages to communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to
   return.
   Attorney and Client

   Inspector Bucket, who has previously investigated several matters
   related to Jarndyce and Jarndyce, accepts Sir Leicester's commission to
   find Lady Dedlock. At first he suspects Lady Dedlock of the murder but
   is able to clear her of suspicion after discovering Hortense's guilt.
   He requests Esther's help to find her mother. Lady Dedlock has no way
   to know of her husband's forgiveness or that she has been cleared of
   suspicion, and she wanders the country in cold weather before dying at
   the cemetery of her former lover, Captain Hawdon (Nemo). Esther and
   Inspector Bucket find her there.

   Progress in Jarndyce and Jarndyce seems to take a turn for the better
   when a later will is found, which revokes all previous wills and leaves
   the bulk of the estate to Richard and Ada. John Jarndyce cancels his
   engagement to Esther, who becomes engaged to Mr Woodcourt. They go to
   Chancery to find Richard. On their arrival, they learn that the case of
   Jarndyce and Jarndyce is finally over, because the costs of litigation
   have entirely consumed the estate. Richard collapses, and Mr Woodcourt
   diagnoses him as being in the last stages of tuberculosis. Richard
   apologises to John Jarndyce and dies. John Jarndyce takes in Ada and
   her child, a boy whom she names Richard. Esther and Mr Woodcourt marry
   and live in a Yorkshire house which Jarndyce gives to them. The couple
   later raise two daughters.

   Many of the novel's subplots focus on minor characters. One such
   subplot is the hard life and happy, though difficult, marriage of Caddy
   Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop. Another plot focuses on George
   Rouncewell's rediscovery of his family, and his reunion with his mother
   and brother.
