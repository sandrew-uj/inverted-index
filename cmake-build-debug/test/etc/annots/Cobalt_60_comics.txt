   Cobalt 60 takes place in a post-apocalyptic, Mad Max-like world
   inhabited by mutants, aliens, and other fantastic creatures. Its
   titular character embarks on a quest to avenge the death of his
   parents, murdered by the evil Strontium 90. After he succeeds in his
   quest, he inherits his father's kingdom, but prefers to return to his
   wild ways. Cobalt 60 is very violent and quite graphic in its action
   scenes.
