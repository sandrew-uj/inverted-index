   Map of Florin and Guilder

   In a Renaissance-era world, a young woman named Buttercup lives on a
   farm in the country of Florin. She abuses the farm hand Westley,
   calling him "farm boy" and demands that he perform chores for her.
   Westley's response to her demands is always "As you wish." She
   eventually realizes that what he is saying is, "I love you." After
   Buttercup realizes that she loves him and confesses her feelings,
   Westley goes to seek his fortune so they can marry. Buttercup later
   receives a letter that the Dread Pirate Roberts attacked his ship at
   sea. Believing Westley dead, Buttercup sinks into despair. Later she
   reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of
   Florin.

   Before the wedding, a trio of outlaws--the Sicilian criminal genius
   Vizzini, the Spanish fencing master Inigo Montoya, and the enormous and
   mighty Turkish wrestler Fezzik--kidnap Buttercup. A masked man in black
   follows them across the sea and up the Cliffs of Insanity, whereupon
   Vizzini orders Inigo to stop him. Before the man in black reaches the
   top of the cliff, a flashback of Inigo's past reveals that he is
   seeking revenge on a six-fingered man who killed his father. When the
   man in black arrives, Inigo challenges him to a duel. The man in black
   wins the duel, but leaves the Spaniard alive. Vizzini then orders
   Fezzik to kill the man in black. His flashback showed Fezzik as a
   lonely boy who was "accepted" by Vizzini. His conscience compelling
   him, Fezzik throws a rock as a warning and challenges the man to a
   wrestling match. The man in black accepts the challenge and chokes
   Fezzik until the giant blacks out. He then catches up with Vizzini and
   proposes a Battle of the Wits, guessing which cup of wine is poisoned
   with iocane powder. They drink, and Vizzini dies. The man in black then
   explains to Buttercup that he poisoned both cups, having built up an
   immunity to iocane powder beforehand.

   With Prince Humperdinck's rescue party in hot pursuit, the man in black
   flees with Buttercup. He taunts Buttercup, claiming that women cannot
   be trusted and that she must have felt nothing when her true love and
   sweetheart had died. She shoves him into a gorge, yelling, "You can
   die, too, for all I care!", and hears him call, "As you wish!" from the
   bottom of the ravine. She realizes he is Westley, and follows him down
   into the gorge, to find him battered but largely unhurt. They travel
   through the Fire Swamp to evade Humperdinck's party. At Buttercup's
   insisting, Westley tells Buttercup about his experience with the Dread
   Pirate Roberts and how he secretly became the latest in a line of men
   to use that identity.

   The Fire Swamp has many obstacles, such as Snow Sand and Rodents of
   Unusual Size (R.O.U.S., /ru:s/, ROOS). Westley and Buttercup
   successfully navigate the Fire Swamp, but they are captured by Prince
   Humperdinck and his cruel six-fingered assistant, Count Tyrone Rugen.
   Buttercup negotiates for Westley's release and returns with Humperdinck
   to the palace to await their wedding. Rugen follows Humperdinck's
   secret instructions not to release Westley, but to take him to his
   underground hunting arena, the "Zoo of Death". Here, Rugen tortures and
   weakens Westley with his life-sucking invention, The Machine.

   Meanwhile, Buttercup has nightmares regarding her marriage to the
   prince. She expresses her unhappiness to Humperdinck, who proposes a
   deal wherein he will send ships to locate Westley, but if they fail to
   find him, Buttercup will marry him. The novel reveals that, to start a
   war with the neighboring country of Guilder, Humperdinck himself had
   arranged Buttercup's kidnapping and murder, but that he now believes
   that Buttercup dying on her wedding night will inspire his subjects to
   fight more effectively.

   On the day of the wedding, Inigo meets again with Fezzik, who tells him
   that Count Rugen is the six-fingered man who killed his father. Knowing
   that Vizzini is dead, they seek out the man in black hoping that his
   wits will help them plan a successful attack on the castle to find and
   kill Count Rugen. Buttercup learns that Humperdinck never sent any
   ships, and taunts him with her enduring love for Westley. Enraged,
   Humperdinck tortures Westley to death via The Machine. Westley's
   screams echo across the land, drawing Inigo and Fezzik to the Zoo of
   Death. Finding Westley's body, they enlist the help of a magician named
   Miracle Max who was fired by Humperdinck. Max pronounces Westley to be
   merely "mostly dead", and returns him to life (out of a desire to get
   back at Humperdinck), though Westley remains partially paralyzed and
   weak.

   Westley devises a plan to invade the castle during the wedding, and the
   commotion caused by this prompts Humperdinck to cut the wedding short.
   Buttercup decides to commit suicide when she reaches the honeymoon
   suite. Inigo pursues Rugen through the castle and kills him in a sword
   fight. Westley reaches Buttercup before she commits suicide. Still
   partially paralyzed, Westley bluffs his way out of a sword fight with
   Humperdinck, who shows himself to be a coward. Instead of killing his
   rival, Westley decides to leave him alive. The party then rides off
   into the sunset on four of the prince's purebred white horses. The
   story ends with a series of mishaps and the prince's men closing in,
   but the author indicates that he believes that the group got away.
