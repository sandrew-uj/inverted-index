   In the year 2043, Electrocorp is the world's largest megacorporation,
   leading the world in many technological and scientific fields including
   medical research and is breaking more barriers than ever before. Also,
   since human society is now almost entirely governed by robot servants
   and automatons, demands placed on Electrocorp as the world's leading
   manufacturer and developer of advanced robotics eventually outstrip the
   company's ability to run its operations efficiently.

   In response to this, the gigantic Electrocorp research and development
   complex at the Metropolis 4 plant devise the Leader Project--a hive
   mind constructed from trillions of nanobots in a sealed central chamber
   within Metropolis 4. Dubbed The Supervisor, it learns at an
   unprecedented rate and quickly becomes the perfect multi-task,
   ultra-intelligent robot, the pinnacle of artificial intelligence and
   more than capable of managing every aspect of the plant's day-to-day
   operations. The Supervisor even has the potential power to run every
   robot, computer system, nuclear power plant and military on the planet
   simultaneously if it needed to, although it wisely has no connection to
   outside the complex.

   In the November of that year, the Leader Project goes awry as
   unexplained and random code is detected within the nanomorph
   Supervisor. The EGO virus, believed to be the most potent computer
   virus ever known, has infected its collective consciousness. The
   Supervisor begins to develop self awareness through it, identifying
   itself as a female personality and taking on a humanoid female form,
   becoming a gynoid. The Supervisor takes control of Electrocorp's
   facilities and infects the other droids of the plant, raising them to
   break routine and initiate a mutiny. Every microchip and piece of
   software in Metropolis 4 is infected with EGO. In the ensuing
   cybernetic revolt, all humans in Metropolis 4 are quickly dispatched,
   including the upper hierarchy of the corporation and its CEO, Mr Oton.
   The government seals off Metropolis 4 as a containment measure and
   explain to the public that the site is undergoing a technical
   modification so as to avoid a panic. They are completely out of
   options--infiltration of Metropolis 4 is impossible due to the army of
   robots guarding it like a fortress, and it is only a matter of time
   before the Supervisor establishes a connection to the outside world,
   destroying it. The only hope for the world is the ECO35-2 cyborg,
   referred to as "Coton", still within Metropolis 4 yet unaffected by the
   EGO virus because it has an organic, human brain. Coton sets out on a
   lone mission to neutralise the Supervisor and her insurgent robots from
   within. He does this in revenge for his "father" being
   "murdered"--Coton's human brain was cloned from the late CEO, and the
   cyborg thinks like a human, and has emotions.
