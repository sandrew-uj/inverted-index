   Bank teller and avid bookworm Henry Bemis (Meredith) reads David
   Copperfield while serving a customer from his window in a bank. He is
   so engrossed in the novel he regales the increasingly annoyed woman
   with information about the characters, and shortchanges her. Bemis's
   angry boss (Taylor), and later his nagging wife (deWit), both complain
   to him that he wastes far too much time reading "doggerel". As a cruel
   joke, his wife asks him to read poetry to her from one of his books; he
   eagerly obliges, only to find that she has inked over the text on every
   page, obscuring the words. Seconds later, she destroys the book by
   ripping the pages from it, much to Henry's dismay.

   The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank's
   vault, where his reading cannot be disturbed. Moments after he sees a
   newspaper headline, which reads "H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction",
   an enormous explosion outside shakes the vault, knocking Bemis
   unconscious. After regaining consciousness and recovering the thick
   glasses required for him to see, Bemis emerges from the vault to find
   the bank demolished and everyone in it dead. Leaving the bank, he sees
   that the entire city has been destroyed, and realizes that, while a
   nuclear war has devastated Earth, him being in the vault has saved him.

     Seconds, minutes, hours--they crawl by on hands and knees for Mr.
     Henry Bemis, who looks for a spark in the ashes of a dead world. A
     telephone connected to nothingness. A neighborhood bar, a movie, a
     baseball diamond, a hardware store, the mailbox at what was once his
     house and is now a rubble. They lie at his feet as battered
     monuments to what was but is no more. Mr. Henry Bemis, on an
     eight-hour tour of a graveyard.

   Finding himself alone in a shattered world with canned food to last him
   a lifetime and no means of leaving to look for other survivors, Bemis
   succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver
   he has found, Bemis sees the ruins of the public library in the
   distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact; all
   the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and time to
   read them without interruption.

   His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to
   reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. Just
   as he bends down to pick up the first book, he stumbles, and his
   glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains
   of the glasses without which he is virtually blind and bursts into
   tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.
