   Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin is a scientist living in the city of New
   Crobuzon. He is approached by Yagharek, a member of a birdlike species
   known as garuda, who has had his wings removed as a punishment for an
   undisclosed crime in his native land. He asks Isaac to help him to fly
   again. Isaac agrees and starts collecting flying creatures for research
   purposes with the aid of Lemuel Pigeon, a fence with links to the
   criminal underworld. One creature is a large and unusual caterpillar,
   stolen from a government research lab. The caterpillar sickens until
   Isaac accidentally discovers it feeds on a popular hallucinogenic drug.
   It grows and starts to pupate. After reaching maturity, it emerges as a
   monstrous flying beast known as a slakemoth, able to paralyse its
   victims using hypnotic patterns on its wings. It escapes after eating
   the mind of one of Isaac's colleagues, leaving him catatonic. Isaac,
   Yagharek and Lemuel resolve to re-capture or destroy it.

   Isaac's girlfriend Lin is a khepri, an insect-like humanoid and an
   artist. She is commissioned by Mr Motley, a mob boss, to make a
   sculpture of him. Mr. Motley has four more of the slakemoths in
   captivity and harvests their milk to sell as drugs. After Isaac's
   slakemoth frees its siblings, Mr Motley discovers Isaac's connection to
   the slakemoths. Assuming Isaac to be a potential rival in the drug
   trade, he imprisons Lin, demanding that Isaac return his creatures. The
   slakemoths start to terrorise New Crobuzon, feeding on its inhabitants.

   With the aid of Derkhan, a journalist and friend of Lin, Isaac
   discovers that Mr. Motley purchased his slakemoths from the government.
   The security forces become aware of the activities of the slakemoths
   and begin to suppress the various rebellious elements within the city.
   To re-capture the slakemoths, they attempt to enlist the help of demons
   and the Weaver, a spider-like creature who moves through dimensions,
   obsessed with patterns and its own peculiar view of beauty. The demons
   refuse to assist and the Weaver soon ends up aiding Isaac.

   Isaac and his friends kill one of the slakemoths with the aid of a
   sentient machine known as the Construct Council. They then destroy the
   eggs that the slakemoths have laid before laying a trap for the
   remainder of the creatures. The trap is mostly successful, but the last
   slakemoth escapes and returns 'home' to Mr. Motley's facility. The
   Weaver transports Isaac to the warehouse where they find Lin, who has
   been tortured but is still working on the sculpture. A confrontation
   occurs, during which Lin's mind is half eaten and the last slakemoth is
   killed by Mr. Motley's men. Isaac escapes with Lin and Yagharek and
   prepares to leave the city. Isaac learns of Yagharek's crime, a rape of
   one of his own species, and declines to help him fly again. Lin never
   fully recovers and Yagharek is left alone in the city, pulling out his
   feathers and having to accept his new flightless identity.
