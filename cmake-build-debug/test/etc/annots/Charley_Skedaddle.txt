   The book follows Charley, a twelve-year-old boy who runs errands for
   the leader of the Bowery Boys. Then he decides to leave home after
   joining the Bowery Boys gang and causing trouble. All Charley wants is
   to be like his older brother Johnny, who was killed during the Battle
   of Gettysburg, so he leaves behind his gang life to join the 140th
   Regiment. He is initially eager to fight, but flees shortly after
   shooting a Rebel soldier. Ashamed, Charley keeps running and is
   captured by an enemy soldier but later flees again after gaining a
   chance to escape. He keeps running until he reaches the Blue Ridge
   Mountains, where he lives with Granny Bent, an elderly mountain woman
   who calls herself a "doctor-woman". Charley learns much from her and
   gains a new sense of maturity and self-respect. He is inevitably forced
   to flee again but with the knowledge that what he has gained from his
   time in the mountains will go with him.
