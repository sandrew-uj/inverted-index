   A zombie apocalypse has ravaged the entire world, with zombies
   outnumbering humans 400,000 to 1. The surviving humans live within
   barricaded camps and secure underground bunkers.

   In an underground facility in the Everglades housing scientists and
   soldiers, the scientists are trying to find a solution to the zombie
   pandemic; the soldiers have been assigned to protect them. Dr. Sarah
   Bowman, her lover and soldier Private Miguel Salazar, radio operator
   Bill McDermott, and helicopter pilot John fly from their underground
   base to Fort Myers, Florida, in an attempt to locate additional
   survivors. They find only a large horde of the undead, and they return
   to the base, where they are told that the military detachment's
   officer-in-charge Major Cooper has died. Sarah becomes concerned over
   Miguel's worsening mental state.

   Dr. Logan, the lead scientist (whom the soldiers nickname
   "Frankenstein" because of his grisly surgical dissections of zombies),
   believes that the zombies can be made docile by training and
   conditioning. He keeps a collection of captive zombies for use as test
   subjects, in a large underground corral in the compound. The angry and
   reactionary Captain Rhodes and the soldiers that he leads vehemently
   object to the dangers involved in capturing zombies and keeping them
   inside the compound. The tension between soldiers and scientists
   worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, loss of communication with
   other survivors, and slow, uncertain progress in research.

   During a meeting between the scientists and the soldiers, Rhodes
   declares that, following the death of Major Cooper, he is taking
   command of the base. He only grants the scientists "some" time to prove
   results, and declares that he will execute anyone who interferes with
   his leadership. He also threatens to abandon the scientists and leave
   the compound, cutting off their protection from the zombies. Shaken by
   Rhodes' threats, Sarah goes to the quarters shared by John and Bill to
   discuss the situation. John professes his conviction that the
   zombie-plague is a form of divine punishment against mankind, that the
   scientific mission is doomed to failure, and that the effort to
   preserve records of civilization is pointless. He suggests that the
   three of them should take the helicopter, abandon the soldiers, and fly
   to a desert island somewhere where they could live off the land and
   start a family.

   Dr. Logan hopes to secure Rhodes' goodwill by showing him the results
   of his research. Logan is especially proud of "Bub", a friendly and
   non-aggressive zombie who remembers some parts of his past life and
   engages in rudimentary human behavior: listening to music, aiming a
   pistol, saluting Captain Rhodes, and repeating a string of garbled
   words. "Civility must be rewarded," Logan tells Rhodes. "If it's not
   rewarded, there's no use for it." Rhodes, however, is not impressed.

   During a zombie roundup mission, a zombie escapes its harness when
   Miguel loses his focus, which results in the deaths of two soldiers,
   Miller and Johnson. Miguel attempts to kill the creature, but another
   zombie bites him on the arm, after that, he screams in horror and flees
   as Sarah goes after him. With John and Bill's help, Sarah amputates
   Miguel's arm and cauterizes it with fire to stop the spreading
   infection from killing him and re-animating him into a zombie. Rhodes
   then calls off the experiments and demands that all captive zombies be
   destroyed, as well as severing any further help from him and his
   remaining men.

   Sarah and Bill later discover that Logan had been experimenting on the
   remains of the dead soldiers and an audio recording of him rambling to
   himself through some wires plugged into Johnson's severed head. Fearing
   that Logan has gone insane and with the conditions worsening, Bill
   decides that they should leave in the helicopter immediately. Rhodes
   finds out that Logan has been feeding the flesh of his dead soldiers to
   Bub as a reward for his docility and positive behavior. Enraged, Rhodes
   kills Logan and seizes the remaining scientists and non-military
   personnel, stripping them of their weapons. Rhodes brings his prisoners
   and attempts to force John to fly him and his remaining soldiers away
   from the base, which John refuses to do. In response, Rhodes kills
   Logan's assistant, Fisher, locks Sarah and Bill inside the zombie
   corral with the zombies, and orders Steel to beat John into submission.

   Back in Dr. Logan's laboratory, Bub manages to escape from his chains
   and finds Dr. Logan's corpse. In a display of human emotion, he mourns
   the loss of his instructor, then picks up a pistol and goes in search
   of revenge.

   Meanwhile, a suicidal Miguel heads off unnoticed to the outside fence,
   where he first opens the gate to allow hundreds of zombies to walk
   through, and then allows the zombies to begin tearing him apart before
   he presses the release button that lowers the steel loading gate and
   gives the zombies access to the base. While he is doing this, John
   overcomes his captors, steals their weapons and goes into the zombie
   corral to rescue Sarah and Bill. As the zombies enter the complex,
   Rhodes leaves his men behind. Torrez and Rickles are killed by the
   horde while Steel is bitten and commits suicide. Bub finds Rhodes and
   fires at him. Rhodes desperately tries to escape, but he runs into a
   huge mass of zombies, and is shot in the stomach by Bub. Bub mockingly
   salutes Rhodes as the zombies tear him apart. John, Sarah and Bill
   manage to get to the surface and fly in the helicopter to a deserted
   island, as John had earlier suggested.
