   By the year 4000, humanity has become dependent on robots. H8, the
   Pol-Rob  chief of the civic sector of North Am, a
   continent-spanning mega-city, is damaged in a radiation accident. It
   seeks to promote the human dependency on robots and gradually impose
   totalitarian rule in the area under its control.

   Magnus was raised by a robot known as 1A, a name which implies that he
   is the very first robot of his type ever manufactured. 1A seems to be
   self-aware and possess emotions. A firm believer in the Three Laws
   of Robotics, 1A recognized the threat represented by the dependency of
   humans on robots in general, and the developments in North Am due to H8
   in particular. Therefore, 1A trained Magnus to protect humans against
   both rogue robots, and humans who used normal robots for evil purposes.
   Magnus was trained from infancy by 1A in an under-sea domed house,
   using advanced techniques, to become a skilled martial artist who could
   break steel with his bare hands. In addition, 1A equipped his
   charge with a device that would allow him to "hear" robot-to-robot
   radio communications.

   Leeja is Magnus's girlfriend. Robots that served as police are
   called "Pol-Robs" (as in police robots) and are painted black and white
   like city police cars. All robots have identifying numbers painted on
   their chest and backs. Other robots, such as taxi drivers, could be
   nothing more than a torso with arms and head attached to a flying
   automobile.
