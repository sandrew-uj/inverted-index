   During the original outbreak of the Rage Virus, Don, his wife Alice and
   four more survivors hide in a barricaded cottage on the outskirts of
   London. They hear a terrified boy pounding at their door and Alice lets
   him in. A few minutes later, they discover that the infected have
   followed the boy. The infected attack and kill most of the survivors,
   while Don, Alice and the boy are chased upstairs. Don pleads with Alice
   to leave the boy but she refuses. He abandons them as the infected
   break into their room by escaping out of the window. After watching his
   wife being dragged out of sight by the infected, he narrowly escapes on
   a boat piloted by Jacob, who falls in the water and is overcome by the
   infected.

   After the infected begin to die of starvation, NATO forces take control
   of Britain. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, an American force,
   under the command of Brigadier General Stone, brings in settlers. Among
   the new arrivals are Don and Alice's children, Tammy and Andy, who were
   out of the country during the outbreak. They are admitted to District
   One, a safe zone on the Isle of Dogs, guarded by the US Army. Sergeant
   Doyle, a Delta Force sniper and his friend, Chief Flynn, a helicopter
   pilot, are amongst the troops guarding the district. Tammy and Andy are
   reunited with their father, who was found by the US Army and has become
   the district's caretaker. In their new flat, Don fabricates a lie about
   the circumstances surrounding their mother's death.

   That night, Andy dreams about forgetting his mother's face, so Tammy
   and Andy sneak out of the safe zone and return to their former home,
   where they collect family photographs and other mementos. To his shock,
   Andy finds Alice alive and seemingly uninfected in a semi-conscious,
   delirious state. The three are soon discovered by soldiers and taken
   back to District One. Alice is taken to a quarantine room, where she is
   tested and found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the rage virus. Don
   makes an unauthorized visit to Alice in her isolation cell, begging her
   to forgive him. She accepts his apology and tells him she loves him,
   prompting him to kiss her, unaware she is an infected. Don transforms,
   brutally beats her to death and goes on a rampage, infecting and
   killing thousands of innocents in the way.

   General Stone orders the building to be quarantined and orders a Code
   Red alert in District One. Civilians are herded into safe rooms while
   the soldiers search for infected but despite the precautions, Don
   breaks into a room full of people and starts a domino effect of rapid
   infection. The crowd, with half its members infected, breaks out of the
   safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a US Army medical officer,
   rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to
   shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with
   the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy and
   several others through the Greenwich Foot Tunnel. Stone orders District
   One to be firebombed but large numbers of the infected, including Don,
   escape the bombardment. After escaping with a survivor named Sam, the
   only survivor of a sniper attack that killed most of the group, Scarlet
   informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure because of
   their genetic make up and must be protected.

   Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle but refuses to take anyone
   else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who might be
   infected. However, a desperate Sam attempts to leap onto the
   helicopter, and is infected and falls, which forces Flynn to abandon
   the four. Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells him to leave the
   civilians and head to Wembley Stadium. Doyle ignores his instructions
   and escorts Andy, Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an
   abandoned Volvo V70 to escape nerve gas released to kill the infected
   but are unable to start the car while soldiers with flamethrowers draw
   near. Doyle exits the car and sacrifices himself by push starting the
   car and is burned alive. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives
   Tammy and Andy into the London Underground, where the trio continues on
   foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet, then bites Andy.

   Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy, who remains symptom-free but
   an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and
   are picked up by a reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the English
   Channel to France, as instructed by Doyle. Twenty-eight days later, a
   French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in
   Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of the infected are then seen
   running through a tunnel that, as they emerge into the open, is
   revealed to be the exit of the Paris Metro Trocadero Station with a
   view across the Seine to the nearby Eiffel Tower, indicating that the
   virus has spread to Continental Europe.
