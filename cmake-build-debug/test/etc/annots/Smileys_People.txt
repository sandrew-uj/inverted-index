   Maria Andreyevna Ostrakova, a Soviet emigree in Paris, is told by a
   Soviet agent calling himself "Kursky" that her daughter Alexandra, whom
   she was forced to leave behind, may be permitted to join her. Maria
   applies for French citizenship for her daughter. After no further
   contact with "Kursky", Maria writes to General Vladimir, a former
   Soviet general and British agent for help. Vladimir realises that Maria
   was used to provide a false identity for an unknown young woman, a ploy
   associated with KGB spymaster Karla, and that this is probably an
   unofficial operation.

   Vladimir contacts Toby Esterhase, his old handler in the Circus, but
   Esterhase has left and refuses to assist. Vladimir sends a confidant,
   Otto Leipzig, to Paris to interview Maria who identifies "Kursky" in a
   photograph. Vladimir contacts the Circus again, and insists on speaking
   to his former senior case officer, George Smiley, who is also retired.
   The Circus personnel are skeptical and uncooperative. Meanwhile,
   Vladimir is betrayed to Karla and assassinated on Hampstead Heath while
   on his way to meet a junior Circus contact.

   Circus head Saul Enderby and Civil Service undersecretary Oliver Lacon
   want to bury the matter quickly to protect the Circus from scandal.
   They recall Smiley from his retirement to tidy the matter up. Smiley
   takes Vladimir's claims seriously and investigates. He recovers a
   second letter from Maria, who fears for her life. Near the site where
   Vladimir was killed, he discovers the negative of a compromising
   photograph of Leipzig and another man with prostitutes. Smiley consults
   dying former Circus researcher Connie Sachs, who identifies the second
   man as Oleg Kirov, also known by the cover name "Kursky". Connie also
   recounts rumours that Karla had a daughter by a mistress whom he had
   later sent to the Gulag. The daughter, Tatiana, was unstable and was
   confined to a mental institution.

   Smiley flies to Hamburg and tracks down Claus Kretzschmar, an old
   associate of Leipzig and owner of the night club where the photograph
   was taken. He finds that Leipzig has been murdered by Karla's agents.
   Kretzschmar gives Smiley tape recordings of Leipzig and Kirov. Smiley
   hastens to Paris where, with help from his old colleague Peter Guillam,
   he gets Maria to safety. He also learns that Kirov has been summoned
   back to Moscow, and has probably been killed for his indiscretions.

   The transcribed tape of Kirov's confession to Leipzig shows that Karla
   is secretly diverting funds to a Swiss bank account using a commercial
   attache named Grigoriev, of the Soviet Embassy in Bern. The money is
   used for the care of Karla's daughter, who has been committed to an
   expensive Swiss psychiatric sanatorium under the faked citizenship
   papers of Maria's daughter. Smiley explains to Enderby that they may be
   able to blackmail Karla and force him to defect. Enderby authorizes
   Smiley to mount an operation to secure the evidence from Grigoriev.

   Smiley and Esterhase sets up a covert team in Bern to keep Grigoriev
   under observation. They soon obtain evidence of his unofficial handling
   of funds for Karla and his affair with one of his secretaries. Smiley
   presents him with the choice of cooperating or being thrown to the
   mercy of Swiss authorities and, later, Karla. Grigoriev quickly
   confesses all he knows of the arrangements regarding "Alexandra's" care
   and the details of the visits he makes to her. Among her "symptoms" is
   her insistence that she is actually called Tatiana and is the daughter
   of a powerful man who can make people disappear. Smiley writes a letter
   to Karla, which Grigoriev passes on instead of his usual weekly report
   on "Alexandra"'s treatment. The letter details Karla's illegal
   activities and offers him defection to the West and protection for
   Tatiana, or to face destruction at the hands of his rivals in Moscow
   Centre.

   In a final scene, Karla, posing as a labourer, defects using one of the
   bridge crossings between East and West Berlin. Before crossing over
   into the waiting arms of Western agents, Karla stops and lights a
   cigarette. As he passes near Smiley he drops a gold cigarette lighter,
   a gift to George from Ann, that he purloined from Smiley twenty years
   earlier in a Delhi prison. Smiley does not pick up the lighter.
