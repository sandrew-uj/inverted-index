   When Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy came out in 1974, revelations exposing
   the presence of Soviet double agents in Britain were still fresh in
   public memory. Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, John Cairncross, and Kim
   Philby, later known as members of the Cambridge Five, had been exposed
   as KGB moles. The five had risen to very senior positions in branches
   of the British government. The book, based on the premise of uncovering
   a Soviet double agent in the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), offers
   a novelisation of this period. It is also set against a theme of
   decline in British influence on the world stage after the Second World
   War, with the USSR and the USA emerging as the dominant superpowers
   during the Cold War.

   David Cornwell, who wrote under the pseudonym John le Carre, worked as
   an intelligence officer for MI5 and MI6 (SIS) in the 1950s and early
   1960s. Senior SIS officer Kim Philby's defection to the USSR in
   1963, and the consequent compromising of British agents, was a factor
   in the 1964 termination of Cornwell's intelligence career. In
   the novel, the character of Bill Haydon, with his easy charm and strong
   social connections, bears a close resemblance to Philby.

   The title alludes to the nursery rhyme and counting game Tinker Tailor.
