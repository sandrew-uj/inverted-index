   Pfaall for Jules Verne's "Edgar Poe et ses oeuvres" (1864)

   The story opens with the delivery to a crowd gathered in Rotterdam of a
   manuscript detailing the journey of a man named Hans Pfaall. The
   manuscript, which comprises the majority of the story, sets out in
   detail how Pfaall contrived to reach the Moon by benefit of a
   revolutionary new balloon and a device which compresses the vacuum of
   space into breathable air. The journey takes him nineteen days, and the
   narrative includes descriptions of the Earth from space as well as the
   descent to its fiery, volcanic satellite. Pfaall withholds most of the
   information regarding the surface of the Moon and its inhabitants in
   order to negotiate a pardon from the Burgomaster for several murders he
   committed as he left Earth (creditors of his who were becoming
   irksome). After reading the manuscript, the city authorities agree that
   Pfaall should be pardoned, but the messenger who brought them the text
   (apparently a resident of the Moon) has vanished and they are unable to
   restore communication with him.
