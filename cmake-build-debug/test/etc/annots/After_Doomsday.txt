   The novel explores events after the destruction of Earth, from the
   point of view of two returning starship crews, one entirely made up of
   men, the other consisting entirely of women.

   The story is set in the early 21st century. Even as the Cold War
   dragged on, Earth has been suddenly contacted by the Monwaingi
   space-faring culture. The technology of interstellar travel is
   spreading across the galaxy, disrupting one culture after another.
   Monwaing itself was contacted only a few centuries previously. Another
   culture, the Vorlak, underwent a transition from a stable planetary
   society to a warlord culture similar to the Japanese Shogunate. The
   nomadic Kandemirian culture became a hegemonistic one similar to the
   Mongol Empire. Earth found itself on the fringes of a conflict between
   Kandemir and a coalition led by Vorlak, with Monwaing on the sidelines,
   actively supporting the anti-Kandemir forces.

   There is a lingua franca called Uru, which bonds the diverse cultures
   together. The original speakers of the language may have also initiated
   the spread of interstellar technology, but the language seems to have
   outlived, or at least outstripped its originators.

   In the 20 years since contact, several expeditions have set out, some
   in borrowed ships, some in ships built on Earth. The ship USS Benjamin
   Franklin, with an all-male crew, set out to visit the core of the Milky
   Way -- actually an unusual quest by the stodgy standards of the typical
   galactic culture. Another ship has gone as far as the Magellanic
   Clouds. The pan-European expedition in the ship Europa, crewed entirely
   by women, has roamed far outside the local group of cultures. The
   star-drive technology allows journeys of tens of thousands of parsecs
   in mere months. In spite of this, most cultures are "stay-at-homes"
   compared to humans, interacting only with the local group of cultures,
   known as a "cluster".

   Now the Franklin and the Europa return to find that Earth has suffered
   the ultimate disaster.
