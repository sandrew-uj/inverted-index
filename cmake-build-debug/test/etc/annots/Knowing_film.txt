   In 1959, a Lexington, Massachusetts elementary school celebrates its
   opening with a competition in which students draw what they believe
   will happen in the future. All of the children create visual works
   except for Lucinda Embry, who is guided by whispering voices to fill
   her paper with a series of numbers. Before she can write the final
   numbers, the allotted time for the task expires and the teacher
   collects the students' drawings. The following day, Lucinda engraves
   the remaining numbers into a closet door with her fingernails. The
   works are stored in a time capsule and opened fifty years later, when
   the current class distributes the drawings inside among the students.
   Lucinda's sheet is given to Caleb Koestler, the nine-year-old son of
   widowed MIT astrophysics professor John Koestler.

   John notices that Lucinda's numbers are dates, death tolls, and
   geographical coordinates of major catastrophes over the past fifty
   years, and three have yet to happen. In the following days, John
   encounters two of the three final events in person: a plane crash and a
   subway train collision. John becomes convinced that his family has a
   significant role in these incidents: his wife died in one of the
   earlier events, while Caleb was the one to receive Lucinda's message.
   Meanwhile, Caleb begins hearing the same whispering voices as Lucinda.

   To prevent the last event, John tracks down Lucinda's daughter Diana
   and her granddaughter Abby. After some initial disbelief, Diana goes
   with John to Lucinda's childhood home, where they find a copy of
   Matthaeus Merian's engraving of Ezekiel's "chariot vision", in which a
   great sun is represented. They also discover that the final two digits
   of Lucinda's message are not numbers, but two reversed letter E's,
   matching the message left by Lucinda under her bed: "Everyone Else".
   During this search, Caleb and Abby, who were left asleep in the car,
   have an encounter with the beings who are the source of the whispers.
   Diana tells John that her mother had always told her the date she
   (Diana) would die. He also visits Lucinda's teacher who tells him of
   the scratching on the door left by Lucinda.
   A copy of Matthaeus Merian's engraving of Ezekiel's "chariot vision"
   (1670), which the film's protagonists interpret as an announcement of
   the end of the world.

   The next day, Abby colors in the sun on the engraving, which gives John
   a revelation. He rushes to the MIT observatory and learns that a
   massive solar flare with the potential to destroy all life will hit the
   Earth on the last date indicated by the message. As Diana and Abby
   prepare to take refuge underground, John goes to the school and finds
   the door on which Lucinda engraved the final numbers, and identifies
   them as coordinates of a place where he believes that salvation from
   the solar flare can be found. The disbelieving and hysterical Diana
   loads both Caleb and Abby into her car and flees for the caves.

   At a gas station, the whispering beings steal her car with Caleb and
   Abby inside. Diana pursues them at speed (in a stolen SUV) but is
   killed in a traffic accident involving a semi-truck, on the date her
   mother predicted. The beings take Caleb and Abby to Lucinda's mobile
   home, where John encounters them shortly thereafter. The beings, who
   act as extraterrestrial angels, are leading children to safety on
   interstellar arks. John is told he cannot go with them because he never
   heard the whispering, so he convinces Caleb to leave with Abby, and two
   pet rabbits they found, and both are transported away by the beings.
   The following morning, John decides to visit his family before the
   flare strikes, and drives through a chaotic Boston to his parents'
   house, where he reconciles with his estranged father. The solar flare
   then strikes, destroying the Earth's atmosphere and all life on the
   planet. Meanwhile, the ark, along with others, deposits Caleb and Abby
   on another world resembling an earthly paradise, and departs. The two
   run through a field towards a large white mysterious tree (implied to
   be the tree of life).
