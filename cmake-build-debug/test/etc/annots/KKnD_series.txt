   The year 2079 AD saw the realisation of Mankind's ultimate nightmare:
   an all-out nuclear war exterminates a quarter of the world's population
   almost instantly. Infrastructure collapses as mutagenic viruses infect
   humans and animals alike. Most of the survivors of the attack (aptly
   named the Survivors) live underground. Those who don't are mutated by
   the viruses and nuclear fallout (what they call the Evolved). 2141 sees
   the underground dwellers breaking through to the surface, after living
   underground for decades. Soon enough, the "Evolved" and "Survivors"
   meet. The Evolved and the Survivors do battle until the Survivors are
   surrounded at their underground HQ. The battle ends in a stalemate and
   both the Evolved and the Survivors retreat to recoup their losses for
   the next 40 years.

   The Survivors return underground, re-evaluate their strategy and try to
   determine why they were nearly wiped out by the "freakers". Over time,
   they regroup and build new, superior weaponry in their determination to
   win the war for the surface. The Evolved retreat far into the
   wastelands and in turn wonder why they suffered such a loss against the
   "symmetrics". The Evolved council decree that use of pre-war technology
   had angered their gods, who denied them their victory as punishment. As
   a result, the Evolved shun pre-war machines and begin to utilise
   mutated animals in combat.

   As the decades pass, a third faction arises: Series 9, agricultural
   robots who have developed self-awareness and begun to construct their
   own unique weapons of war.

   After the war of 2079, the Series 9 agriculture robots realized their
   reason for existence was wiped out along with the withered crops. In
   time, partially malfunctioning due to the nuclear exchange, they begin
   to cultivate a deep-seated hate towards all humans. Series 9 focus
   first on the destruction of Series 5, 6, 7 and 8, Series 1-4 having
   already been wiped out in 2079. When Series 9 subsequently moved to
   attack the Survivors and the Evolved during their initial conflict,
   they quickly discovered that the organics possessed far greater
   weaponry in comparison to their agricultural tools. While the war for
   the surface raged on and then fell silent for 40 years, Series 9
   developed their own weaponry in silence, in preparation for the next
   bout of hostilities.

   In the end, the Survivors emerge victorious. Overtime, nature returns
   to the Earth and the survivors rebuilds their world far better than
   their old world.
