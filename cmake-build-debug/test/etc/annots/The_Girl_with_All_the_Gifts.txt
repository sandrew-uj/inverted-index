   Twenty years ago humanity was infected by a variant of the fungus
   native to South America called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which led
   to the Breakdown - the end of civilization as it was before. The
   infected, referred to as "hungries", quickly lose their mental powers
   and feed on the flesh of healthy humans. The disease spreads through
   blood and saliva, but can also spread airborne through spores created
   by the fungus. In England, the few surviving uninfected humans either
   live in heavily guarded areas such as Beacon, or roam in packs of
   hostile, scavenging "junkers".

   The authorities in Beacon set up a remote military base for the study
   of a specific group of child hungries. They, unlike others, are able to
   retain their mental powers and only lose control when they get too
   close to human scent. The only way to hide the scent is to use a
   substance called e-blocker, which is in limited supply.

   Soldiers, led by Sergeant Eddie Parks, find such child hungries and
   bring them to the base, Hotel Echo, which is 30 miles outside of London
   and 74 miles outside of Beacon. At the base, the children are educated
   by teachers and tested by the head scientist, Dr. Caroline Caldwell.
   This often means she vivisects the children, which Helen Justineau, a
   behavioural psychologist and teacher at the base, dislikes. Justineau
   sees the child hungries as people, and is especially fond of Melanie, a
   10-year-old with a genius-level IQ who is obsessed with Greek
   mythology, namely the story of Pandora. Melanie loves Justineau as a
   surrogate mother. Like the other children, Melanie does not understand
   that she is different from the adults.

   Dr. Caldwell, who believes that she is close to a cure for the fungus,
   chooses to dissect Melanie. As Justineau interrupts and tries to save
   her the base is attacked by a group of junkers and hungries; Caldwell
   is badly wounded, and in saving Justineau, Melanie eats flesh for the
   first time, awakening the "hunger" of the fungus. The three find Parks
   and Private Kieran Gallagher, and flee the base together. The group
   decides to travel to Beacon, 74 miles away, but the adults argue over
   whether to bring Melanie. Parks only agrees after placing a muzzle and
   handcuffs on the child and making her ride on the roof of the tank.
   Melanie cooperates, now aware of the danger she poses to the others.

   Melanie proves useful to the adults; hungries do not attack her, and
   she can lead them away from the humans. While Caldwell still sees
   Melanie as a specimen, the others begin to trust the child. After
   several encounters with hungries, including a few adults that also
   retain some human-like behavior, the group finds the mobile laboratory
   Rosalind Franklin. It was built soon after the epidemic began with
   state-of-art facilities for experimentation and attack, but disappeared
   on its research mission. Caldwell, who is dying from sepsis, uses its
   equipment to urgently continue her research.

   While Melanie sates her hunger away from the others by eating wild
   animals, she finds a group of child hungries. Melanie sees that they,
   too, retain their mental functions, although they have no language of
   their own, being uneducated. Afraid that they will be experimented on,
   Melanie instead tells the adults she saw a large group of junkers, but
   reveals the truth to Justineau. Gallagher, scared of junkers, flees the
   lab. He is found by the intelligent hungries, killed, and eaten.

   While Parks and Justineau search for Gallagher, Caldwell--obsessed with
   finishing her research before dying--captures one of the intelligent
   hungries and experiments on him. She makes remarkable findings but does
   not let the others inside, fearing that they will interfere. Melanie
   finds a giant mass of fungal fruiting bodies that have grown in the
   years since the infection began; while there are enough spores to
   infect the entire world by air currents, the pods that contain the
   spores (sporangia) do not open on their own.

   Melanie tricks Caldwell into letting her inside. Before dying, Caldwell
   shares her findings with Melanie: There is no cure or vaccine for the
   fungus. Intelligent hungries are second-generation ones, conceived by
   hungries who retained some human behavior. Those born in this way
   retain their mental abilities.

   Outside the lab, Parks and Justineau are cornered by hungries. Melanie
   frightens them away, but Justineau is knocked unconscious and Parks is
   bitten and infected. Parks asks Melanie to shoot him before the
   infection cycle finishes so he does not turn into a hungry; she agrees
   to do so. She asks him to shoot the mass of spores with a flamethrower,
   deducing correctly that the environmental trigger to open the spores is
   fire. Before Melanie complies with Parks' request to kill him, she
   explains that as long as there are healthy humans, the war between them
   and the hungries will continue. For second-generation hungries to be
   born and rebuild the world, every human must first be infected.

   Justineau awakens in the Rosalind Franklin. Melanie leads her to a
   group of intelligent hungries, to whom Justineau, wearing an
   environmental protection suit, starts teaching the alphabet.
