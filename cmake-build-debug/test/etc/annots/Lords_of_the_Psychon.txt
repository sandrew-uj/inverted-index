   The novels starts on September 24, 1993 (at the time of writing, thirty
   years in the future) and Captain Geoffery Maddox, U.S. Army is leading
   a detail from the headquarters of the Third Army against a target. The
   detail consists of a retired U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer, a Marine
   Corporal, a Marine Private, an Army Private, and a civilian scout. They
   are the members of the only known military force left on Earth, and
   they try to smuggle the last known atomic bomb into one of the
   mysterious alien structures that now dot the surface of the Earth. They
   desperately hope that setting off a fifty kiloton nuclear explosion can
   disrupt the operation of the structure and thereby lessen the effects
   of what is known as "Horror Day," or "H-Day".

   Their plan backfires, and the city completely absorbs the fifty-kiloton
   explosion. The following H-Day is exceptionally bad. After a recovery
   period lasting a few months, the people in the nearby villages are
   angry at the Third Army. They believe that the alien city should be
   left alone, and then the aliens might leave the villagers alone. They
   start launching small scale attacks against the base and sniping at the
   soldiers. At about the same time, a stranger shows up at the military
   base. He has stolen something from a distant City of Force. There are
   many such Cities of Force scattered around the world, and together they
   create and support the grid that causes Horror Day. The stranger
   presents two glowing rings, one green and one yellow. They seem
   weightless and can be stretched to any size and broken to form more
   rings just like the original. When they are held with the green ring
   within the yellow one, they spew forth glowing plasma which is the
   basis of the alien cities. When the positions are reversed and the
   yellow is put inside the green, the rings re-absorb the plasma. The
   plasma can take any shape or color, can be accommodating or hostile,
   and is very hard for the soldiers to figure out. One old soldier, who
   used to be a scientist and is now the base's doctor, spends weeks
   trying to understand the rings. He makes some progress, but the
   scientific method can't shed too much light on how the plasma works
   because it takes on whatever properties the doctor wants. If he thinks
   it should be hard, it becomes hard. If he thinks it should be a liquid,
   it becomes a liquid.

   Later, the doctor is found dead in his lab, hanging from a rope of
   plasma. Maddox thinks that while he was drunk, his subconscious mind
   took control of the plasma and gave him the peace he so desperately
   wanted for years. Apparently, the plasma can be controlled by the
   conscious and unconscious mind.

   Maddox comes up with a solution; he takes the rings away from the base,
   and while completely alone, works with them trying to find out how to
   control the plasma. During his time away he meets a young lady named
   Edie, who for some time has been harboring a baby sphere. This is very
   surprising to Maddox, as the spheres are feared. However, this one has
   taken to Edie and continually follows her around. Maddox, helped by the
   girl's uncle, is able to observe and learn about the nature of spheres.

   Maddox comes up with the theory that the plasma responds to both the
   conscious and the subconscious contents of the minds of those who are
   around it. Maddox decides that he is going to have to find a way to
   control his subconscious if he wants to learn to control the plasma. He
   works with the rings and the plasma while going through a kind of
   "house cleaning" of his subconscious mind and becomes better able to
   control the mysterious plasma. He feels that controlling the plasma is
   the key to destroying the Cities of Force. As he progresses in his work
   with the plasma, he becomes telepathic, and can telepathically
   communicate with Edie. They work out a plan to abandon the baby Sphere,
   as it has been getting bigger and more dangerous, by going to the
   nearby City of Force. When they get to the city they discover that they
   are able to affect the city with their newly concentrated minds. They
   can create walls, doors, and structures. Maddox isn't perfect in his
   control; he makes some mistakes, especially while unsuccessfully trying
   to protect a pregnant woman who is close to giving birth. The spheres
   do not allow new babies to live, and there haven't been a birth since
   the Spheres conquered the earth.

   Maddox and Edie go back to the garrison and convince several of the
   soldiers to learn how to control the rings because the next Horror Day
   is soon to arrive. Maddox and Edie train the men, and soon there have a
   group who are telepathic, can share each other's visual impressions,
   and can control the plasma to some extent. Their control is imperfect,
   but they learn to control it enough to build an elaborate plasma
   structure inside their encampment.

   Almost a year passes, with another H-Day is coming. During the last
   year, Maddox has come to the conclusion that H-day happens because the
   Spheres are trying to move Earth into a different dimension-reality,
   and the terrible effects felt on H-day are caused by being in this
   different place. So far the Spheres have failed to transfer the planet,
   but they are getting closer each year. That means that when the Spheres
   succeed, the effects of H-day will never end. Maddox also believes that
   the Spheres will succeed this year unless he and the other members of
   his band can do something to disrupt H-day.

   The people in the surrounding villages are frightened, believing the
   soldiers experiments with the plasma will upset the Spheres and make
   H-day even worse than it was the year before. Therefore villagers
   organize an attack on the base, where at the same time, a band of
   religious fanatics also decide to attack. The soldiers can't hold their
   structure up against the mental hysteria of the mobs, and the Spheres
   join in the attack. As their plasma city of force starts to crumble,
   Maddox manages to use his new mental powers to transport 18 soldiers
   who have learned to control the plasma to 18 alien Cities of Force just
   as the villagers overrun their camp. H-Day commences at that very
   moment. Maddox can't do any more and can only hope the men he sent out
   will be able to disrupt the Cities of Force and keep H-day from
   happening.

   While experimenting with the rings Maddox found that anything put
   through a ring will travel in time. The distance traveled in time is
   controlled by how big the rings are made. Maddox and Edie decide to
   stretch a ring out to a large size, jump through the ring, and travel
   through time to the future. They end up at the same site years later
   where they see a statue depicting their feat and how it freed the earth
   from domination of the Spheres.
