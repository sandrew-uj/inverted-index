   The story of Days of Ruin is unconnected to the stories of previous
   games. Almost 90% of humanity has been killed off following devastating
   meteor strikes which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a
   massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and
   thereby preventing the growing of crops. Scattered survivors pick
   through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers
   patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent
   while the others prey upon them.

   Following the disaster, which obliterated much of the warring nations
   of Rubinelle and Lazuria, a young cadet from the Rubinelle military
   academy named Will escapes the ruins of the academy's mess hall and is
   confronted by The Beast, a former sergeant gone rogue who leads a small
   band of raiders. Will is rescued by Brenner and Lin of Rubinelle's 12th
   Battalion (nicknamed "Brenner's Wolves"), and takes on the group's
   cause of saving as many survivors of the meteor strikes as possible.
   During a search, Will discovers a mysterious amnesiac who does not
   remember her own name, but somehow knows detailed military information.
   Will later names her Isabella, and she becomes a vital part of the
   battalion as they put an end to the Beast's reign of terror.

   One year after the meteor strikes, the 12th Battalion comes into
   contact with the New Rubinelle Army, and learns of the war raging
   between the Lazurian Army and the NRA. Brenner reluctantly sides with
   Greyfield, leader of the NRA, and advances on the Lazurian force,
   eventually defeating them at Fort Lazuria. Distraught by the ruthless
   execution of the Lazurian commander, Forsythe, Brenner and the 12th
   Battalion break the Lazurian prisoners out of an NRA internment camp
   before they can be executed. While the group escapes, Brenner stays
   behind and hides in an abandoned city to buy them some time. An
   infuriated Greyfield orders the use of a new weapon which completely
   destroys the city, killing Brenner and the NRA troops searching for
   him. Lin later leads a force against Greyfield, preventing the launch
   of a wave of deadly Caulder missiles and defeating the NRA once and for
   all. In the process, Lin personally shoots and kills Greyfield,
   avenging Brenner's death.

   The 12th Battalion is unexpectedly attacked soon after by Intelligent
   Defense Systems, a private military contractor that had secretly
   supported first the Lazurians, then the NRA by supplying them with
   weapons of mass destruction. Dr. Caulder, leader of IDS, had taken
   advantage of the world's devastation to carry out horrific biological
   and psychological experiments that he would have been unable to
   undertake otherwise, such as creating and spreading a terrible new
   disease called the Creeper, which causes flowers to bloom from infected
   individuals, for the sole purpose of studying the survivor's reactions.
   Despite numerous demoralizing attacks by IDS and its massive bomber,
   The Great Owl, the battalion survives and infiltrates and brings down
   The Great Owl, eventually pursuing Caulder to his main laboratory and
   fortress, The Nest. In the end, Caulder is killed in the destruction of
   his lab, and the war is finally brought to an end. One year later, the
   village of New Hope, founded by the 12th Battalion after the conflict,
   begins to flourish in the new-found peace. The sun is seen rising above
   the nearby hills for the first time since the meteor strikes, giving
   hope of a brighter future.
