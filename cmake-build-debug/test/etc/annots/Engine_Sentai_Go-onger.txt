   Machine World (MaSiN6Wa-6RuDo, Mashin Warudo) is one of the 11
   Braneworlds (BuRe-6N6Wa-6RuDo, Burenwarudo) other than our own, which
   is referred as the Human World (HiYU-6MaN6Wa-6RuDo, Hyuman Warudo), and
   it is home to giant vehicular beings called Engines who wage a war
   against the Gaiark who desire to pollute their world. Losing, Gaiark's
   three Pollution Ministers' escape leaves them on Earth, seeing the
   Human World as an easier location to create their ideal paradise. The
   six Engines manage to pursue them, selecting five humans to become
   their partners, the Go-ongers. The team are joined by Go-on Wings and
   their Wing Engines, as well as the Ancient Engines, as they all
   together battle the Gaiark as well as other evil villains from other
   Braneworlds.
