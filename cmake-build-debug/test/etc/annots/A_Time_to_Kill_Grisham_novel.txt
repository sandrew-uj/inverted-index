   The story takes place in the fictional town of Clanton, in the equally
   fictional Ford County, Mississippi. This setting is also featured in
   other John Grisham novels. A passage in The Chamber reveals that the
   events of A Time to Kill took place in 1984.

   Three of the characters, Jake Brigance, Harry Rex Vonner, and Lucien
   Wilbanks, later appear in two sequel novels, 2013's Sycamore Row and
   2020's A Time for Mercy. Harry Rex Vonner and Lucien Wilbanks also
   appear in Grisham's 2003 novel The Last Juror, which is set in Clanton
   in the 1970s. Harry Rex Vonner also appears in the 2002 Grisham novel,
   The Summons, and in the short story "Fish Files", in the 2009
   collection Ford County.
