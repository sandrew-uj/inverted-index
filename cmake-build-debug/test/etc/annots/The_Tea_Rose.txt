   In London in 1888, 17-year-old Fiona Finnegan, daughter of Irish
   immigrants Paddy and Kate, works under William Burton, owner and
   founder of Burton Tea. Paddy works as a docker in Whitechapel and is
   later called upon to lead the dockers to support labour unions. Fiona
   and her childhood sweetheart, Joe Bristow, remain hopeful that they
   will be able start their own grocery shop with the money that they save
   until Joe is tricked into marrying Fiona's rival, Millie Peterson. Soon
   after, her father is killed by slipping on grease and falling from a
   building window. Her mother is forced to move her children from their
   childhood home without her husband's wages to support them. She is
   later murdered by Jack the Ripper when she finds him murdering her
   neighbor. Struck with grief at his mother's death, Fiona's younger
   brother Charlie runs away and is found dead in the Thames. Fiona and
   her little brother Seamie are taken in by their family friend, Roddy
   O'Meara, who lived with them in the previous home. In an attempt to
   receive compensation for her father's death, Fiona goes to William
   Burton's office. Instead, she overhears Burton and Bowler Sheehan, a
   harsh criminal, discussing Paddy's murder by Sheehan. Fiona flees, not
   realizing she took five hundred pounds in notes from Burton's desk.
   With Seamie in tow, Fiona flees London. When she flees, she met someone
   name Nick Soames, and they pretended to be a couple due to the fact
   Fiona could not get a ticket for her and Seamie. When she goes to
   America, she has a quest to find her uncle Michael, who was also a shop
   owner. When she finds him, he is drunk because his wife had died from
   cholera, and he could not take care of his daughter, Nell. Fiona tells
   him to stop drinking and move on, but he can't. Michael was in debt
   with the bank and had to close his shop, but Fiona decides to open it
   up and start business along with the help of their neighbors.
