   The story follows three interwoven plots:

   1. The story of Andrew Harrington, a man who fell desperately in love
   with "Marie Jeanette Kelly" (or "Mary Kelly"), one of the victims of
   Jack The Ripper. Harrington falls into a deep depression after
   discovering Kelly's body, and turns to alcohol and eventually opium to
   cope with the grief. He eventually decides to commit suicide, but is
   interrupted by his cousin Charles, who begs him to come with him to
   meet a man who claims he can travel in time.

   2. The story of Claire Haggerty, a "New Woman" and feminist who is
   deeply unhappy with her life. She is supposed to choose a husband, but
   most of her suitors are only interested in her finances or in the
   continuation of their family line. Haggerty stumbles upon "Murray's
   Time Travel", and meets Captain Derek Shackleton, the man who leads the
   human race in the battle against the machines in the year 2000.

   3. The final section of the story focuses on HG Wells himself, as he
   tries to discern if the fourth dimension is actually something that can
   be broken through, or if it is just a storytelling mechanism in stories
   (like the ones he writes). He discovers the "Map Of Time" in a house in
   London (that is reputedly haunted), he discovers that time is not a
   plaything - and his actions could have serious repercussions.
