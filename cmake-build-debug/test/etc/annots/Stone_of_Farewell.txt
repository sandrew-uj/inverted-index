   The previous volume saw Simon wound a dragon with the mystical sword
   Thorn, splashing himself in dragon's blood, leaving himself deeply
   scarred (physically and emotionally). Now bearing the sobriquet
   "Snowlock", he and his companions leave the mountains in search of the
   mysterious "Stone of Farewell".

   Meanwhile, Josua "Lackhand", brother to the king, leads a motley band
   of survivors after the disastrous events at Naglimund.

   Princess Miriamele, having escaped before the siege of Naglimund, gets
   caught up in events that demonstrate the evil powers surrounding her
   father.

   Princess Maegwin of Hernystir leads her people deep underground, where
   they discover secrets that may help turn the tide in a war thought to
   be hopeless.

   Finally, a power rises in the North, but its true implications may not
   yet be fully revealed.
