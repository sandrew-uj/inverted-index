   Wright composed Deluge while working as an accountant. Unable to sell
   his story to a commercial publisher, Wright opted to self-publish
   Deluge after noting the positive reception garnered from his previous
   novel The Amphibians. Previously, Wright had focused on writing
   poetry, helping to found the Empire Poetry League. Prior to Deluge,
   Wright had little experience in writing science fiction novels, though
   Wright was always known to have an interest in the genre.
