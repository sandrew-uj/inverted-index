   Stanton (Scott Brady) has taken charge of a research company following
   the death of his father. He warns scientists Mark Manning (Anthony
   Eisley), "Doc" Gordon (Abraham Sofaer), and Karen White (Gigi Perreau)
   that unless they prove that their time travel experiments can produce
   some results, their funding will be cut off.

   Desperate, they push their equipment past the level of safety and
   travel 5000 years into the future. There, they encounter aliens led by
   Vina (Poupee Gamin) who are looking for a planet to colonize. The
   aliens find no welcome on Earth, which is in the midst of a global war
   that threatens the human race. She urges them to go back and warn
   humanity about the danger, then dies in a human attack. The time
   travelers retreat to their chamber and head back. On the way, they
   detect another time machine on a collision course. Manning tries to
   communicate with them; when that fails, they fire at it, but their
   weapon is too weak. Stanton takes charge, boosts the power and destroys
   the other vessel.

   They overshoot the present and end up in the distant past, in the age
   of dinosaurs. Their giant ruby, a key component of the machine, is
   destroyed, leaving them stranded. When they explore a nearby cave, they
   find it studded with all sorts of jewels, including rubies. Overcome by
   greed, Stanton grabs handfuls of precious gems, returns to the time
   machine, replaces the ruby and takes off without the scientists.
   However, on his return trip, he encounters another time travelling
   machine on a collision course. As he hears a radio broadcast from
   Manning, Stanton realizes with horror that he is racing towards the
   earlier version of the time machine. Then he is destroyed by the blast
   initiated by his earlier self.

   Meanwhile, as the scientists leave the cave, Gordon stumbles and falls
   to his death in molten lava. Mark and Karen find the time machine gone;
   then it mysteriously reappears. They board it and try to return to
   their present, but arrive the day before their initial departure; as a
   result, they see their past selves living at a much slower time rate.
   They hasten back to the time machine to try to fix the problem, but end
   up hopelessly lost in time and space. In the final scene, the machine,
   with the two scientists on board, is shown drifting among the stars
   towards an unknown fate.
