   A witch, Jenny Waynest, and lord, John Aversin, who live in the
   decaying Northlands are approached by a young southern noble, Gareth,
   who requests they slay a dragon in the capital city of Bel to the
   south. The pair agree on the condition the king send troops to the
   north to fend off bandits. On arriving, it is revealed that Gareth is
   not a mere noble, but the prince of the realm seeking aid against the
   wishes of his father. The dragon is revealed as Morkeleb the Black, an
   ancient and powerful dragon, now inhabiting the caverns of the gnomes.
   In addition, the sorceress Zyerne is revealed to hold the king in her
   power, dominating him with the goal of capturing the power of the Stone
   in the heart of the gnomish Deep. John is persuaded to kill Morkeleb,
   with Jenny's assistance, but is himself wounded and Jenny is forced to
   save the dragon's life in exchange for that of John's. In saving
   Morkeleb's life, Jenny's weak powers are much augmented, allowing her
   to confront Zyerne but also tempting her to transform into a dragon and
   abandon the concerns of humanity. Zyrene enters the Deep, attempting to
   claim its magic, but is defeated when the Stone is destroyed by John,
   Jenny and Morkeleb. Jenny accepts Morkeleb's offer to transform into a
   dragon, but later returns to the North, unable to live without her
   humanity.
