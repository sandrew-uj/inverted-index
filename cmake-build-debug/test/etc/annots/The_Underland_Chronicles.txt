   The Underland Chronicles is a series of five epic fantasy novels by
   Suzanne Collins, first published between 2003 and 2007. It tells the
   story of a boy named Gregor and his adventures in the "Underland," a
   subterranean world located under New York City. The Underland is
   inhabited by humans who traveled below hundreds of years ago, along
   with various giant versions of creatures like bats, cockroaches, and
   rats. According to the author, the series involves many topics relating
   to war, including biological warfare, genocide, and military
   intelligence.^[1] While not as well known as the author's subsequent
   Hunger Games trilogy, it has been reviewed favorably by many critics.
