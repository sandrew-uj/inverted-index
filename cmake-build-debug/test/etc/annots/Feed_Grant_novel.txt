   Feed is set several decades after the zombie apocalypse, referred to as
   the Rising. Two man-made viruses (a cure for cancer and a cure for the
   common cold) combined to form Kellis-Amberlee, a virus that quickly
   infects all mammalian life. Kellis-Amberlee is normally benign, but the
   virus can "go live" or "amplify", converting any host mammal over 40
   pounds (18 kg) into a zombie. There are three mentioned ways
   amplification takes place: the death of the host, contact with a live
   specimen (being bitten by a zombie) and spontaneous conversion. Those
   infected that have not undergone amplification remain lucid until the
   virus has time to spread through the body. Lucidity is followed by lack
   of sensitivity to pain, memory loss and finally conversion.

   Most humans reside in tightly controlled safe zones, with rigorous
   blood testing and decontamination protocols used to prevent the spread
   of the live K-A virus. After the inaction of traditional media during
   the Rising, blogs and other new media have taken over as the primary
   source of information and entertainment; bloggers are recognised as
   professional journalists, with individuals specialising and identifying
   as "Newsies" (objective, fact-based reporters), "Stewarts" ("who report
   opinion informed by fact"), "Irwins" (named after Steve Irwin, who
   seek to educate and entertain by going out and "poking things with
   sticks"), "Aunties" (who share personal stories, recipes, and other
   content "to keep people happy and relaxed"), or "Fictionals" (fictional
   content and poetry creators).

   Feed occurs in 2040 and is written from the perspective of Georgia
   "George" Mason, a Newsie blogger and head of the After the End Times
   website. Georgia, her brother Shaun (an Irwin), and their friend
   Georgette "Buffy" Meissonier (a Fictional and a technology guru), are
   selected to cover the presidential campaign of Senator Peter Ryman, a
   moderate Republican. The campaign is mostly uneventful until it reaches
   Eakly, Oklahoma, where zombies attack the campaign convoy, killing
   several before security (assisted by Georgia and Shaun) can contain
   them; they later discover it was an orchestrated attack. The next stage
   of the campaign is the Republican National Convention, where Ryman
   faces off against religious, right-wing Governor David Tate and
   sex-over-substance Congresswoman Kristen Wagman. During the convention,
   Rick Cousins (a Newsie and former print journalist) defects from
   Wagman's campaign to join After the End Times. Ryman is selected as the
   Republican presidential candidate, but as this is announced, Georgia
   learns that a zombie outbreak occurred at the senator's horse ranch,
   and his eldest daughter is dead. Georgia and company investigate and
   find that the outbreak started from a horse injected with the live
   virus.

   Ryman and the campaign relocate to Texas, where Ryman joins his
   vice-presidential candidate: Tate. The bloggers must drive their
   vehicles and equipment overland. During the trip, the journalists'
   convoy (which has become separated from that part of the presidential
   entourage that drove ahead of them) is attacked by a sniper. Georgia,
   Shaun, and Rick survive, but the van carrying Buffy and Chuck (Buffy's
   beau) crashes. Chuck dies, zombifies, and bites Buffy. She confesses to
   leaking information to a group undermining Ryman's campaign; the attack
   occurred because she had refused to continue. After administering a
   coup de grace, Georgia calls for rescue, but the Centers for Disease
   Control (CDC) team drugs the surviving group members and takes them for
   testing. After being released, the team's work on the campaign is
   hampered as they dig into the underlying conspiracy, souring the
   bloggers' relationship with Ryman and Tate. The team finds evidence
   linking Tate to the attacks, along with hints of a broader conspiracy
   involving the CDC and other parties, but when Georgia confronts Ryman
   during an event in Sacramento, California, he is skeptical and sends
   them away to prepare to convince him with facts, otherwise he will fire
   them from the campaign. As the bloggers leave, they are attacked, and
   Georgia is shot with a tranquiliser dart containing the live virus.
   Rick escapes with a copy of the group's evidence just before a zombie
   outbreak is instigated, and Shaun helps Georgia expose the conspiracy
   through one last blog post. She then begins amplifying, forcing Shaun
   to execute her.

   The novel's narration then changes to Shaun's perspective. He rallies
   Ryman's security detail to help contain the outbreak, then breaks into
   the convention centre to confront Ryman and Tate. Tate takes Ryman's
   wife hostage with a syringe of the zombie virus, claiming his actions
   were part of a plot using fear of the zombies to reshape America into a
   more faith-based society. Then the governor injects himself instead,
   and Shaun shoots him to prevent zombification.
