   The Last Man on Earth

   It is 1968, and Dr. Robert Morgan lives in a world where everyone else
   has been infected by a plague that has turned them into undead,
   vampiric creatures that cannot stand sunlight, fear mirrors, and are
   repelled by garlic. They would kill Morgan if they could, but they are
   weak and unintelligent. Every day Morgan carries out the same routine:
   he wakes up, marks another day on the calendar, gathers his weapons,
   and then goes hunting for vampires, killing as many as he can and then
   burning the bodies to prevent them from coming back. At night, he locks
   himself inside his house.

   A flashback sequence explains that, three years earlier, Morgan's wife
   Virginia and daughter Kathy had succumbed to the plague before it was
   widely known by the public that the dead would return to life. Instead
   of taking his wife to the same public burn pit used to dispose of his
   daughter's corpse, Morgan buried her without the knowledge of the
   authorities. When his wife returned to his home and attacked him,
   Morgan became aware of the need to kill the plague victims with a
   wooden stake. Morgan hypothesizes that he is immune to the bacteria
   from a bite by an infected vampire bat when he was stationed in Panama,
   which may have introduced a diluted form of the plague into his blood.

   One day, a dog appears in the neighborhood. Desperate for
   companionship, Morgan chases after the dog but does not catch it.
   Sometime later the dog appears, wounded, at Morgan's doorstep. He takes
   the dog into his home and treats its wounds, looking forward to having
   company for the first time in three years. He quickly discovers,
   however, that it, too, has become infected with the plague. Morgan is
   seen burying the dog, which he has impaled with a wooden stake. Morgan
   sinks further into depression and loneliness.

   After burying the dog, Morgan spots a woman in the distance. The woman,
   Ruth, is terrified of Morgan at first sight and runs from him. Morgan
   convinces her to return to his home, but he is suspicious of her true
   nature. Ruth becomes ill when Morgan waves garlic in her face, who
   claims that she has a weak stomach. Morgan's suspicion that Ruth is
   infected is confirmed when he discovers her attempting to inject
   herself with a combination of blood and vaccine that holds the disease
   at bay. Ruth initially draws a gun on Morgan but ultimately surrenders
   it to him. She tells him that she is part of a group of people like
   her--infected, but under treatment--and was sent to spy on Morgan. The
   vaccine allows the people to function normally with the drug in the
   bloodstream, but once it wears off, the infection takes over the body
   again. Ruth explains that her people are planning to rebuild society as
   they destroy the remaining humans, and that many of the vampires Morgan
   killed were still alive. Ruth desperately urges Morgan to flee, but he
   inexplicably refuses.

   While Ruth is asleep, Morgan transfuses his own blood into her. She is
   immediately cured, and Morgan sees hope that, together, they can cure
   the rest of her people. Moments later, however, Ruth's people attack.
   Morgan takes the gun and flees his home while the attackers kill the
   vampires gathered around Morgan's home. Ruth's people spot Morgan and
   chase him. He exchanges gunfire with them and picks up tear gas
   grenades from a police station armory along the way. While the tear gas
   delays his pursuers somewhat, Morgan is wounded by gunfire and retreats
   into a church. As he stands at the altar, one of his pursuers finally
   impales him with a thrown spear. In his final moments, Morgan denounces
   his pursuers as "freaks" and, as Ruth cradles him, declares that he is
   the last true man on Earth. As Ruth walks away from Morgan's body, she
   notices a baby crying and tries to assure the child that everyone is
   safe now.
