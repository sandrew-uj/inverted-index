   Humanity has lived for 40 million years on a planet called Harmony,
   after leaving an Earth that has been destroyed by human conflict. In
   order not to repeat the mistakes that led to the destruction of
   civilization on Earth, a computer, known as the Oversoul, was left as
   guardian of this planet.

   Its main mission was to prevent humans from developing technologies
   that could make wars a global affair. For that, humans were genetically
   modified so they could communicate with the Oversoul. The Oversoul uses
   this connection to make humans quite easily distracted when thinking
   about forbidden technologies, leading them to forget that train of
   thought. However, after this long time the Oversoul is beginning to
   fail, and it chooses a group of humans to return to Earth in search of
   the Keeper of Earth, in the hopes it will be able to find a way to
   maintain power over the people on Harmony.

   To this end the Oversoul recruits Volemak, father of the protagonist of
   the story, Nafai. Nafai and Issib, his brother, begin to try and defy
   the Oversoul's capability to override thought. Through this they learn
   of the danger that it is in. Nafai begins hearing the Oversoul's voice
   in his mind. The first book focuses on the family's eventual betrayal,
   the taking of the Index, and the downfall of the man Gaballufix, who
   had been planning to ally the city of Basilica, the home of the main
   characters and the setting of the first half of the book, with a
   malignant nation.

   Nafai, Elemak and Mebbekew, his older half brothers, Issib and his
   father Volemak are eventually forced to leave the city. They come back
   to retrieve the Index of the Oversoul, which allows them to communicate
   with it directly. Because of Nafai's careless blunders and miraculous
   successes, Elemak, Nafai's oldest brother, begins to hate him, a theme
   that will play out throughout the rest of the saga.
