   The group encountering Iguanodon

   Edward Malone, a young reporter for the Daily Gazette, asks his editor
   for a dangerous assignment to impress the woman he loves, Gladys, who
   wishes for a great man capable of brave deeds and actions. His task is
   to approach the notorious Professor Challenger, who dislikes the
   popular press intensely and physically assaults intrusive journalists.
   The subject is to be his recent South American expedition which,
   surrounded by controversy, guarantees a hostile reaction. As a direct
   approach would be instantly rebuffed, Malone instead masquerades as an
   earnest student. On meeting the professor he is startled by his
   intimidating physique, but believes his ruse is succeeding. Seeing
   through the masquerade, then confirming Malone's scientific knowledge
   is non-existent, Challenger erupts in anger and forcibly throws him
   out. Malone earns his respect by refusing to press charges with a
   policeman who saw his violent ejection into the street. Challenger
   ushers him back inside and, extracting promises of confidentiality,
   eventually reveals he has discovered living dinosaurs in South America,
   following up an expedition by a now-deceased previous American explorer
   named Maple White. At a tumultuous public meeting in which Challenger
   experiences further ridicule (most notably from a professional rival,
   Professor Summerlee), Malone volunteers for an expedition to verify the
   discoveries. His companions are to be Professor Summerlee, and Lord
   John Roxton, an adventurer who helped end slavery on the Amazon; the
   notches on his rifle showing how many slavers he killed doing so.

   Running the gauntlet of hostile tribes, the expedition finally reaches
   the lost world with the aid of Indian guides, who are superstitiously
   scared of the area. Summerlee retains his scepticism - although being
   delighted at making other scientific discoveries in the field of botany
   and entomology: even a glimpse of a pterodactyl at a distance fails to
   convince him, believing it is some species of stork (the sharper-eyed
   Roxton is inclined to agree it is not a stork but has no clue what it
   really is), until a night-time encounter when it flies down and is seen
   by all at close range, as it steals the companions' dinner. After this,
   Summerlee apologises to Challenger. The cliffs to the plateau itself
   prove to be apparently unscalable, but an adjacent pinnacle turns out
   to be climbable, and moreover, has a tall tree which can be cut down
   and used as a bridge, which allows the four explorers to cross to the
   plateau. However, they are almost immediately trapped on it, thanks to
   the treachery of one of their luggage-porters, Gomez: who, as it turns
   out, is a former slaver whose brother had previously been killed by
   Roxton during his anti-slavery activities. Gomez takes his revenge by
   dropping the tree off the cliff, stranding the explorers on the
   plateau. Gomez himself is subsequently killed by another porter, a
   negro ex-slave named Zambo, who remains loyal to the party: but the
   latter is unable to do much more to help, other than send some of the
   company's supplies over by rope.

   Whilst investigating the wonders of the lost world, discovering many
   plants and creatures thought to be extinct, they narrowly escape an
   attack from pterodactyls. Although barely escaping with their lives,
   Roxton takes great interest in nearby blue clay deposits. At night a
   ferocious dinosaur is about to break through the thorn bushes
   surrounding their camp; Roxton averts disaster by bravely dashing at
   it, thrusting a blazing torch at its face to scare it away. Later, all
   except Malone are captured by a race of ape-men. Whilst in captivity
   they discover that a tribe of natives, with whom the ape-men are at
   war, inhabit the other side of the plateau. Roxton escapes and together
   with Malone mounts a rescue, preventing many unpleasant deaths,
   including a young native who is a prince of his tribe. The rescued
   natives take the party to their village, then with the help of their
   firepower return to defeat the ape-men. After witnessing the power of
   their guns, the tribe wish to keep them on the plateau but, helped by
   the young prince they saved, they eventually discover a tunnel leading
   back to the outside world. During their time with the tribe, Roxton
   plans how to capture a pterodactyl chick, and succeeds in doing so.

   Upon return to England, despite full reports from Malone many
   detractors continue to dismiss the expedition's account, much as they
   had Challenger's original story - although Summerlee, having been on
   the expedition, has now switched sides and is supporting Challenger.
   Anticipating this, at a public meeting Challenger produces the young
   pterodactyl as proof, transfixing the audience and leaving them in no
   doubt of the truth. The explorers are instantly feted as heroes, and on
   a wave of adulation find themselves carried shoulder-high from the hall
   by cheering crowds. The pterodactyl, in the confusion, makes its escape
   and is witnessed several times at different locations around London,
   causing consternation wherever it goes, but is last seen heading off to
   the southwest in the probable direction of its home.

   At a private celebratory dinner, Roxton reveals to the others that the
   blue clay contained diamonds - he had been tipped off to the
   possibility, by the recollection of a similar feature in South Africa -
   and that he managed to extract about -L-200,000 worth, which is to be
   split between them, Challenger plans to open a private museum with his
   share, Summerlee plans to retire and categorise fossils. Malone returns
   to his love, Gladys, hoping she will recognise his achievements.
   Instead, he finds she has now selfishly changed her mind and married a
   very ordinary man instead, an insignificant clerk. Astonished at this
   turn of events, and with nothing to keep him in London, he decides to
   accompany Roxton back to the lost world.
