   Prior to the start of Blood of the Fold, Richard comes to terms with
   his true identity as a War Wizard, a powerful wizard with both additive
   and subtractive magic. The New World, and all the freedom of humankind,
   is under threat from the Imperial Order after the barrier between the
   Old and New World was brought down. The Imperial Order has already sent
   delegations and armies into the New World. Richard's only option to
   stop the invasion is to claim his heritage and unite all free kingdoms
   and provinces under one rule and one command.
