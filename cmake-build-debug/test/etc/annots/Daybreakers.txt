   In 2009, a plague caused by an infected bat transforms most of the
   world's population into immortal vampires. The human population
   plummets, leaving vampires with a severe shortage of blood; vampires
   deprived of blood degenerate into psychotic, bat-like "subsiders". Most
   humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists
   research a synthetic blood substitute. As sunlight is deadly to
   vampires, underground passages and UV-filtered cars are built for safe
   travel, while the few free humans travel by day, hiding in open spaces.

   In 2019, Edward Dalton is the head hematologist for Bromley Marks, a
   pharmaceutical company which is the largest supplier of human blood in
   the US. Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso are developing a blood
   substitute.

   Driving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another
   vehicle off the road. Discovering the occupants are humans, Dalton
   hides them from police. Before they part ways, their leader, Audrey,
   learns Edward's name and occupation from his ID badge.

   At home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie.
   Frankie's gift of a bottle of pure human blood reignites a
   long-standing argument - Edward refuses to drink human blood and uses
   animal blood instead, while Frankie enjoys his vampire status. A
   subsider, a gardener from Edward's neighborhood, invades the house,
   forcing the brothers to kill it.

   The next morning, Audrey visits Edward's home, giving him instructions
   for a meeting. There, Edward is introduced to Lionel "Elvis" Cormac, a
   human who was once a vampire. Before he can explain his reversion, a
   military team arrives with Frankie, who followed Edward and intends to
   capture Cormac and Audrey. Audrey knocks Frankie unconscious and the
   three escape. Cormac reveals that he was cured of vampirism when a car
   crash ejected him from his sun-proof vehicle. Elvis burst into flames
   in the sunlight but landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun
   for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to
   help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure and prevent human genocide.

   At a vineyard that night, Edward meets more humans and Senator Wes
   Turner, a vampire secretly helping the colony develop a cure. An
   approaching convoy of humans is captured, and vampire soldiers track
   the location of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee.
   Audrey, Cormac, and Edward stay behind, and together they recreate the
   method by which Cormac reverted to human form, curing Edward of
   vampirism. They later find Turner and all the humans dead.

   Alison, one of the captured humans, is revealed to be the daughter of
   Charles Bromley (CEO of Bromley Marks) who refused to become a vampire.
   Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire, but she refuses
   to drink human blood. Devolving into a subsider, Alison and others are
   executed by being burnt to death by sunlight. Upset at witnessing
   Alison's death, Frankie seeks out his brother. The military imposes
   martial law to control the subsider population.

   Edward, Cormac, and Audrey break into Christopher's home and ask him to
   help spread the cure. Having finally discovered a viable blood
   substitute, and feeling overshadowed by Edward, Christopher is
   uninterested in a cure and summons soldiers, who capture Audrey while
   Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to
   help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human,
   revealing that the sunlight cure is unnecessary.

   Trying to save Audrey, Edward turns himself in to Charles, who gloats
   about Bromley Marks' new monopoly on the blood substitute. Charles
   reveals his plan to continue hunting humans and sell their blood for
   exorbitant prices, as "people are always willing to pay extra for the
   real thing." Edward taunts Charles into biting him, turning Charles
   human.

   Edward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers on the brink of becoming
   subsiders. Frankie arrives and draws the soldiers' attention to allow
   Edward and Audrey to escape. In the ensuing feeding frenzy, only six
   soldiers are left standing, now cured. To conceal the cure, Christopher
   shoots the soldiers and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac
   kills him with a crossbow.

   The three survivors drive off into the sunrise. In a voiceover, Edward
   announces the cure will change the general population back to restore
   humanity as a subsider flies overhead, suggesting that it may already
   be too late.
