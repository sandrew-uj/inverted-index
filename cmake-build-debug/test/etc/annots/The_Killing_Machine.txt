   To hone his skills, Gersen spends time as a "weasel", a police spy in
   the lawless Beyond. He is sent to disrupt a meeting between a known
   criminal named Billy Windle and a Mr Hoskins, with license to kill if
   necessary. Hoskins is killed, though not by Gersen, who recovers two
   torn pieces of paper that were being exchanged. One paper provides
   information on how to become a "hormagaunt," an undying monster that
   steals children and lives on the mythical planet Thamber, and the other
   paper contains technical specifications that Gersen does not
   understand.

   Gersen is made aware that Billy Windle was Kokor Hekkus. He then learns
   that Hekkus is masterminding a series of kidnappings. The victims are
   taken to Interchange, a planet in the Beyond, where exchanges between
   kidnappers and ransomers are facilitated. Gersen learns that the latest
   victims are the children of Duschane Audmar, a high-ranking Fellow of
   the powerful Institute, who must remain aloof under all circumstances.
   Gersen convinces him to finance a fact-finding mission to learn more of
   Hekkus's activities and to ransom the children.^[2]

   Gersen learns that Hekkus accumulates funds to ransom a young woman
   named Alusz Iphigenia Eperje-Tokay who claims to be from Thamber; she
   fled her homeworld when Hekkus became interested in her and settled on
   Interchange as her only refuge, since even he would not dare interfere
   with the organization. She had set her ransom at 10 billion SVU. Hekkus
   is raising the sum by kidnapping the loved ones of the Oikumene's
   hundred wealthiest citizens, ransoming them for a hundred million
   apiece.

   Gersen also meets Myron Patch, an engineer from Krokinole. Patch had
   built Hekkus a walking "fort" in the form of a dnazd, a many-legged
   monster native to Thamber; but when Hekkus was dissatisfied with the
   result, Patch refused to refund the money already paid, and was
   kidnapped and shipped to Interchange to recover the sum. Gersen ransoms
   him as well as the Audmar children, and temporarily takes a controlling
   interest in his engineering company.

   He determines to lure Hekkus within his reach, and has ideas how to
   correct the faults in the dnazd's walking mechanism. Gersen demands
   more money from Hekkus's agent Seuman Otwal for the alterations, but
   when it is time to deliver the completed fort, Gersen is captured and
   ordered to repay the money; when he cannot, he is dispatched to
   Interchange.

   While there, Gersen sees an old newspaper article that identifies Mr
   Hoskins as a senior bank official. He recalls the cryptic fragment of
   paper he recovered earlier and surmises that it describes marks used to
   authenticate banknotes. He forges enough money to free himself and
   returns with more forged currency to ransom Alusz Iphigenia. She
   receives a bank draft for the ransom (minus Interchange's fee), which
   Gersen promptly exchanges for real currency - the ransoms so far
   accumulated by Kokor Hekkus. He gloats to Alusz Iphigenia that his
   counterfeits were made with bleach, and would soon become obviously
   worthless; Interchange is ruined, and Kokor Hekkus's kidnappings have
   been for nothing. Since she is uninterested in the money, Gersen
   becomes fabulously wealthy.

   Gersen hopes that Alusz Iphigenia will be able to guide him to Thamber.
   She has no knowledge of astrogation but is able to complete a nursery
   rhyme that allows Gersen to deduce the planet's location.

   Thamber is home to a quasi-medieval culture with barbarian tribes into
   whose hands Gersen and Alusz Iphigenia fall. He fights the leader of a
   war-band to save her from sexual slavery, and they accompany the
   warriors to Kokor Hekkus's castle. There the barbarians easily defeat
   Hekkus's foot soldiers, but then Patch's mechanical dnazd appears and
   the barbarians flee in panic before it. Gersen, however, had foreseen
   the possibility of facing Patch's creation and had installed an
   Achilles heel. He disables the war machine and takes its crew prisoner,
   in the process noting that one of the men aboard, Franz Paderbush,
   resembles Seuman Otwal and also Billy Windle, in height and build.

   He takes the fort to the castle of Sion Trumble, who was once Alusz
   Iphigenia's fiance. Trumble offers the services of a friend who knows
   Kokor Hekkus, but the man denies that he is Paderbush. Gersen has his
   suspicions and allows his prisoner to escape, but then forces his way
   into Trumble's private quarters. There he finds Paderbush in the
   process of transforming himself into Trumble, for they are one and the
   same, and both are alter-egos of Kokor Hekkus. Hekkus has no face,
   having concealed his hideous un-face beneath a series of masks. Gersen
   identifies himself, reminds Hekkus of the Mount Pleasant raid in which
   his home was destroyed and nearly all of his family killed, and kills
   him. He then returns to the Oikumene accompanied by Alusz Iphigenia,
   promising to send ships to bring Thamber back into contact with the
   rest of humanity.
