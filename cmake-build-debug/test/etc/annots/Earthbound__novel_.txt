   Earthbound is a 1982 novel by Richard Matheson, originally published
   under the pen name Logan Swanson. Matheson removed his name from the
   original publication by Playboy Press as a result of the publishers'
   severe editing of the manuscript.^[1] It was later reprinted under
   Matheson's name in the United Kingdom in 1989. In 2005, the novel was
   reprinted in its entirety and released in the United States for the
   first time by Tor Books.^[2]

   The novel tells the story of a couple who leave Los Angeles to vacation
   at a remote beach cottage on Long Island. There, they are met by a
   mysterious woman, and memories of their early marriage.
