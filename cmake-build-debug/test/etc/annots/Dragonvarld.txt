   Dragonvarld is a trilogy of fantasy novels by Margaret Weis.^[1] Within
   the series, this also refers to the setting; the word Dragonvarld is
   said to be the Dragon name for Earth ("Dragon World"). It resembles
   Earth of the Late Middle Ages or early Renaissance, complete with a
   church bent on witch and demon hunts. The trilogy describes a world in
   which humans believe that they are the rulers of the world, while the
   co-existing dragons know that they themselves are the true masters.
