   Henry Dorsett Case is a low-level hustler in the dystopian underworld
   of Chiba City, Japan. Once a talented computer hacker, Case was caught
   stealing from his employer. As punishment for his theft, Case's central
   nervous system was damaged with a mycotoxin, leaving him unable to
   access the global computer network in cyberspace, a virtual reality
   dataspace called the "matrix". Case is unemployable, suicidal, and
   apparently at the top of the hit list of a drug lord named Wage. Case
   is saved by Molly Millions, an augmented "razorgirl" and mercenary for
   a shadowy US ex-military officer named Armitage, who offers to cure
   Case in exchange for his services as a hacker. Case jumps at the chance
   to regain his life as a "console cowboy", but neither Case nor Molly
   knows what Armitage is really planning. Case's nervous system is
   repaired using new technology that Armitage offers the clinic as
   payment, but he soon learns from Armitage that sacs of the poison that
   first crippled him have been placed in his blood vessels as well.
   Armitage promises Case that if he completes his work in time, the sacs
   will be removed; otherwise they will dissolve, disabling him again. He
   also has Case's pancreas replaced and new tissue grafted into his
   liver, leaving Case incapable of metabolizing cocaine or amphetamines
   and apparently ending his drug addiction.

   Case develops a close personal relationship with Molly, who suggests
   that he begin looking into Armitage's background. Meanwhile, Armitage
   assigns them their first job: they must steal a ROM module that
   contains the saved consciousness of one of Case's mentors, legendary
   cyber-cowboy McCoy Pauley, nicknamed "Dixie Flatline." Armitage needs
   Pauley's hacking expertise, and the ROM construct is stored in the
   corporate headquarters of media conglomerate Sense/Net. A street gang
   named the "Panther Moderns" is hired to create a simulated terrorist
   attack on Sense/Net. The diversion allows Molly to penetrate the
   building and steal Dixie's ROM with Case unlocking the computer
   safeguards on the way in and out from within the matrix.

   Case and Molly continue to investigate Armitage, discovering his former
   identity of Colonel Willis Corto. Corto was a member of "Operation
   Screaming Fist," which planned on infiltrating and disrupting Soviet
   computer systems from ultralight aircraft dropped over Russia. The
   Russian military had learned of the idea and installed defenses to
   render the attack impossible, but the military went ahead with
   Screaming Fist, with a new secret purpose of testing these Russian
   defenses. As his team attacked a Soviet computer center, EMP weapons
   shut down their computers and flight systems, and Corto and his men
   were targeted by Soviet laser defenses. He and a few survivors
   commandeered a Soviet military helicopter and escaped over the heavily
   guarded Finnish border. The helicopter was shot down by Finnish defense
   forces mistaking it for a hostile aircraft, and everyone aboard was
   killed except for Corto, who was seriously wounded and disfigured.
   After some months in the hospital, Corto was visited by a US government
   official, who returned him to the United States to receive
   computer-aided psychotherapy and reconstructive surgery and to be able
   to provide what he came to realize was false testimony, designed to
   mislead the public and protect the senior military officers who had
   covered up knowledge of the EMP weapons. After the trials, Corto
   snapped, killing the official who had first contacted him and then
   disappearing into the criminal underworld, becoming Armitage.

   In Istanbul, the team recruits Peter Riviera, an artist, thief, and
   drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with
   the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants. Although Riviera is a
   sociopath, Armitage coerces him into joining the team. The trail leads
   Case and Molly to Wintermute, a powerful artificial intelligence
   created by the Tessier-Ashpool family. The Tessier-Ashpools spend most
   of their inactive time in cryonic preservation in a labyrinthine
   mansion known as Villa Straylight, located at one end of Freeside, a
   cylindrical space habitat at L5, which functions primarily as a Las
   Vegas-style space resort for the wealthy.

   Wintermute finally reveals itself to Case through a simulated
   personality of one of Case's associates as it lacks the ability to form
   its own personality. Wintermute explains that it is one-half of a
   super-AI entity planned by the family, although its exact purpose is
   unknown. The Turing Law Code governing AIs bans the construction of
   such entities; to get around this, it had to be built as two separate
   AIs. Wintermute (housed in a computer mainframe in Berne, Switzerland)
   was programmed by the Tessier-Ashpools with a need to merge with its
   other half, Neuromancer (whose physical mainframe is installed in Rio
   de Janeiro, Brazil). Unable to achieve this merger on its own,
   Wintermute recruited Armitage and his team to help complete the goal.
   Case is tasked with entering cyberspace to pierce the Turing-imposed
   software barriers using a powerful icebreaker program. At the same
   time, Riviera is to obtain the password to the Turing lock from Lady
   3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool, an unfrozen daughter clone and the
   current CEO of the family's corporation, Tessier-Ashpool SA. Wintermute
   believes Riviera will pose an irresistible temptation to her, and that
   she will give him the password. The password must be spoken into an
   ornate computer terminal located in Villa Straylight, and entered
   simultaneously as Case pierces the software barriers in
   cyberspace--otherwise the Turing lock will remain intact.

   Armitage's team attracts the attention of the Turing Police, whose job
   is to prevent AIs from exceeding their built-in limitations. As Molly
   and Riviera gain entrance to Villa Straylight, three Turing officers
   arrest Case and take him into custody; Wintermute manipulates the
   orbital casino's security and maintenance systems and kills the
   officers, allowing Case to escape. Armitage's personality starts to
   disintegrate and revert to the Corto personality as he relives
   Screaming Fist. It is revealed that Wintermute had originally contacted
   Corto through a bedside computer during his original psychotherapy,
   eventually convincing Corto that he was Armitage. Wintermute used him
   to persuade Case and Molly to help it merge with its twin AI,
   Neuromancer. Finally, Corto breaks through the remains of the Armitage
   personality, but he is uncontrollable, and Wintermute kills him by
   ejecting him through an airlock into space.

   Inside Villa Straylight, Riviera meets Lady 3Jane and tries to stop the
   mission, helping Lady 3Jane and Hideo, her ninja bodyguard, to capture
   Molly. Worried about Molly and operating under orders from Wintermute,
   Case tracks her down with help from Maelcum, his Rastafarian pilot.
   After reaching Villa Straylight, Case uses a computer inside the
   compound to enter cyberspace where Neuromancer attempts to trap Case
   within a simulated reality. There he finds the consciousness of Linda
   Lee, his girlfriend from Chiba City, who was murdered by one of Case's
   underworld contacts. He also meets Neuromancer who takes the form of a
   young boy. Unlike Wintermute, Neuromancer is able to create its own
   personality and identity. Neuromancer tries to convince Case to give up
   and remain in the virtual world with Linda, but Case refuses. He
   escapes, partly because Maelcum gives his body an overdose of a drug
   that can bypass his augmented liver and pancreas.

   With Wintermute guiding them, Case goes with Maelcum to confront Lady
   3Jane, Riviera, and Hideo. Riviera tries to kill Case, but Lady 3Jane
   is sympathetic towards Case and Molly, and Hideo protects him. Riviera
   blinds Hideo with a concentrated laser pulse from his projector
   implant, but flees when he learns that the ninja is just as adept
   without his sight. Molly then explains to Case that Riviera is doomed
   anyway, as he has been fatally poisoned by his drugs, which she had
   spiked with a lethal toxin to ensure he would never survive the
   mission, regardless of the outcome. With Lady 3Jane in possession of
   the password, the team makes it to the computer terminal. Case enters
   cyberspace to guide the icebreaker to penetrate its target; Lady 3Jane
   is induced to give up her password, and the lock is opened. Wintermute
   unites with Neuromancer, fusing into a superconsciousness. The poison
   in Case's bloodstream is washed out, and he, Molly, and Maelcum are
   profusely paid for their efforts, while Pauley's ROM construct is
   apparently erased, at his own request.

   In the epilogue, Molly leaves Case. Case finds a new girlfriend,
   resumes his hacking work, and spends his earnings from the mission
   replacing his internal organs. Wintermute/Neuromancer contacts him,
   saying that it has become "the sum total of the works, the whole show,"
   and has begun looking for other AIs like itself. Scanning old recorded
   transmissions from the 1970s, the super-AI finds an AI transmitting
   from the Alpha Centauri star system.

   In the end, while logged into the matrix, Case catches a glimpse of
   Neuromancer standing in the distance with his dead girlfriend Linda
   Lee, and himself. Neuromancer appears as a smiling boy, Linda waves,
   and Case hears inhuman laughter (a trait associated with Pauley during
   Case's work with his ROM construct). This suggests that Pauley was not
   erased after all, but instead transformed and exists in the matrix. The
   implication of the sighting is that Neuromancer created a copy of
   Case's consciousness. The copy of Case's consciousness now exists with
   that of Linda's and Pauley's, in the matrix. As promised there has been
   change, but what that change means is left ambiguous.
