   In 2009, American geologist Adrian Helmsley visits astrophysicist
   Satnam Tsurutani in India and learns that an exotic new type of
   neutrinos from a huge solar flare are heating Earth's core. In
   Washington, D.C., Helmsley presents his information to White House
   Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser, who brings him to meet U.S. President
   Thomas Wilson.

   In 2010, Wilson and other world leaders begin a secret project to
   ensure humanity's survival. China and the G8 nations begin building
   nine arks, each capable of carrying 100,000 people, in the Himalayas
   near Cho Ming, Tibet. Nima, a Buddhist monk, is evacuated and his
   brother Tenzin joins the ark project. Funding is raised by secretly
   selling tickets at EUR1 billion per person. By 2011, articles of value
   are moved to the arks with the help of art expert and First Daughter
   Laura Wilson.

   In 2012, struggling Manhattan Beach, California-based science-fiction
   writer Jackson Curtis is a chauffeur for Russian billionaire Yuri
   Karpov. Jackson's former wife Kate and their children Noah and Lilly
   live with Kate's boyfriend, plastic surgeon and amateur pilot Gordon
   Silberman. Jackson takes Noah and Lilly camping in Yellowstone National
   Park. When they enter an area fenced off by the United States Army,
   they are caught and brought to Adrian, who has read Jackson's books.
   After being released they meet conspiracy theorist Charlie Frost, who
   hosts a radio show from the park.

   That night, after the military evacuates Yellowstone, Jackson watches
   Charlie's video of Charles Hapgood's theory that polar shift and the
   Mesoamerican Long Count calendar predict a 2012 phenomenon and the end
   of the world. Charlie reveals that anyone attempting to inform the
   public was or will be killed. After Jackson and his children return
   home, earthquakes begin in California. Jackson gets everyone into the
   limo he is driving and they get to an airport, where a small,
   two-engine plane happens to be in the process of being fueled. Gordon,
   an amateur pilot, is convinced to fly the plane even though he protests
   he has no experience with this particular plane. With the land
   collapsing behind them, everyone jumps into the plane and Gordon gets
   them off the ground just in time. As the Earth-crust displacement
   begins, causing a 10.9 magnitude earthquake, Gordon, Jackson, Kate, and
   the children escape Los Angeles as much of the West Coast slides into
   the Pacific Ocean.

   The group flies to Yellowstone to retrieve a map from Charlie with the
   arks' location. As they leave, the Yellowstone Caldera erupts; Charlie
   is killed while covering the eruption. The group lands in Las Vegas to
   find a larger plane and meet Yuri, his twin sons Alec and Oleg, his
   girlfriend Tamara and their pilot Sasha. Sasha and Gordon fly them out
   in an Antonov An-500 as the Yellowstone ash cloud envelops Las Vegas.

   Adrian, Carl, and Laura fly to the arks on Air Force One. Wilson
   remains in Washington, D.C. to address the nation while billions of
   people die in earthquakes and megatsunamis worldwide, including
   himself. With the presidential line of succession broken, Carl assumes
   the position of acting commander-in-chief.

   As Jackson's group reaches China, their plane runs out of fuel. Sasha
   continues flying the plane as the others escape in a Bentley
   Continental Flying Spur stored in the cargo hold. Sasha is killed when
   the plane slides off a cliff. The others are spotted by Chinese Air
   Force helicopters. Yuri and his sons, who have tickets, are brought to
   the arks but the Curtis family, with Tamara and Gordon, are abandoned.
   The remaining group is picked up by Nima and brought to the arks with
   his grandparents. With Tenzin's help, they stow away on Ark 4, where
   the U.S. contingent is located. As a megatsunami breaches the Himalayas
   and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears,
   keeping a boarding gate open, which prevents the ship's engines from
   starting. In the ensuing chaos, Gordon, Yuri, and Tamara are killed.
   Tenzin is injured, the ark begins filling with water and is set adrift.
   Jackson and Noah dislodge the tool and the crew regains control of the
   Ark before it strikes Mount Everest. Jackson is reunited with his
   family and reconciles with Kate.

   Twenty-seven days later, the waters are receding. The arks approach the
   Cape of Good Hope, where the Drakensberg mountains have now become the
   highest mountain range on Earth, due to the continent of Africa, plus a
   few areas of Europe and Asia, having risen above the waters. Adrian and
   Laura begin a relationship, while Jackson and Kate rekindle their
   romance.
