   The novel centers on Jackson Oz, an outcast among professional and
   academic ecologists and biologists. Oz has tried for years to get other
   scientists to listen to the data he has been collecting on the
   increasing numbers of mammal attacks on humans. He becomes so obsessed
   with this goal that he quits graduate school and devotes himself to
   full-time data collection and arguing his case. Finally, on a trip to
   Botswana, he survives an attack by a large band of male lions in which
   about one hundred people are killed over a large area. He saves the
   life of ecologist Chloe Tousignant. Upon returning to America, he finds
   his girlfriend dead in his apartment, killed and partly eaten by his
   pet chimpanzee.

   Five years later, Oz has married Chloe and they have a son named Eli.
   His theory becomes accepted as all over the world, packs of animals are
   entering densely populated cities and killing humans en masse. He is
   recruited by the US president to research the cause but before he and
   his team of scientists can find an answer, the president's daughter is
   killed by their dog and the military launches strikes against affected
   cities, which worsens the attacks. Continuing his research, Oz
   discovers that animal pheromones have changed due to the widespread use
   of radio communication (cell phones) and petroleum products (notably
   automobile exhaust) and these disrupted pheromones are enlarging the
   animals' amygdalas and causing the aggression. The President of the
   United States orders all electricity, cellphone, and automobile usage
   banned for two weeks, and animal attacks cease nearly immediately as
   the ban takes effect. But after one week, people return to their
   previous habits and the attacks restart with increased ferocity. Oz,
   his wife and son, along with some scientists and political leaders, are
   evacuated to Thule, Greenland, where research into how to reverse the
   changes will take place.
