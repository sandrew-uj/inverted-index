   In 2008, an unknown killer virus, known as the "Reaper virus", has
   infected the country of Scotland. Unable to contain the outbreak or
   cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall
   that isolated Scotland from the rest of Great Britain. Whilst the
   quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the
   government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK
   and the rest of the world. Now a pariah state, the UK collapses into a
   dystopia, rife with unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic
   turmoil.

   Twenty-seven years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed
   police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper
   virus during a routine investigation. Prime Minister John Hatcher
   shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic
   security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher
   orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher
   Dr. Kane who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined.
   Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the
   team. Sinclair is originally from Scotland, having escaped as the
   quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission
   is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.

   Sinclair's team crosses the wall to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known
   location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors,
   Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton
   and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy
   casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to
   be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who
   plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army to
   start their invasion on England, which will bring Great Britain into
   the Golden Age. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the
   rest of his gang, who burn Dr. Talbot alive before devouring his body.
   With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills
   Viper, Sol's second-in-command. She meets with Norton and Stirling, and
   the three escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's
   children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol abolishes martial law by
   creating his own army.

   Meanwhile, back in London, everyone infected with the virus riots,
   destroying everything in sight. Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the
   central London area because of the infection when an infected man
   breaks into Hatcher's office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and
   kills the infected man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Hatcher is
   quarantined by his right-hand man, Michael Canaris, who also takes his
   place as de facto prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide,
   knowing that his exposure means an almost-certain death sentence from
   the virus.

   After leaving the train, Sinclair's group is arrested by soldiers armed
   with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle
   and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth:
   there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a
   medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind
   during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted,
   sadistic lord who now hides from the world around him. Angry to see
   Sinclair return to Scotland after the start of the quarantine, Kane
   sentences her and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon,
   his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers.
   During the duel, Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon while the rest of
   the group escapes, retrieving their equipment and rescuing Sinclair.

   Sinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter
   entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the
   forest and find an intact 2007 Bentley Continental GT, which they fuel
   up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the
   others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they
   are intercepted by Sol's gang, which seeks to avenge Viper once and for
   all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and
   Sinclair's group escape.

   Using a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls
   Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks
   Sinclair into trading Cally (after Stirling suggests that her blood can
   be used to create a vaccine to treat the virus), revealing his scheme
   to spread the Reaper virus all over the UK as both a form of population
   control and for shady profit. It's the only way to preserve his role as
   the creator of the Reaper virus.

   Cally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair
   returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson,
   who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with her. While Sinclair
   finds no sign of her mother, she is able to retrieve a picture of her.
   Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris' coup d'etat scheme. The
   recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country, much to
   Canaris' dismay, as it spells doom to his career and sub-sequential
   criminal conviction. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his
   gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders,
   "If you're hungry, try a piece of your friend". The marauders stand in
   shock for a moment before bursting into cheering, accepting Sinclair as
   their new leader.
