   In the year 3000, Earth is a desolate wasteland. The Psychlos, a brutal
   race of giant humanoid aliens, have ruled the planet for 1,000 years,
   and use human slave labor to strip its minerals and other resources,
   with a special desire for gold. A few primitive hunter-gatherer tribes
   of humans live in freedom in remote, hidden areas, but after ten
   centuries of Psychlo oppression they have abandoned any hope of
   regaining control of their planet. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler rejects this
   universal hopelessness and leaves his tribe in the Rocky Mountains on a
   journey of exploration with a nomad hunter named Carlo. Both are
   captured by a Psychlo raiding party and transported to a slave camp in
   the ruins of Denver, Colorado, the Psychlos' principal base of
   operations. A massive dome over the base protects the Psychlos from
   Earth's atmosphere, which is toxic to them.

   At the camp, they meet Terl the Psychlo security chief, and his deputy,
   Ker. Terl's superiors have had him reassigned to his remote Earth
   outpost indefinitely due to one or more unexplained incidents involving
   "the Senator's daughter". He plans to bribe his way back to the Psychlo
   home planet by illegally mining gold in areas of high radioactivity.
   Psychlos avoid such areas because radiation reacts explosively with the
   gas mixture that they breathe. Terl observes that Jonnie is a
   resourceful human and selects him to lead the mining operation. Jonnie
   acquires a comprehensive knowledge of human history and literature in a
   Psychlo rapid-learning machine. He defiantly declares that one day,
   humans will overthrow the Psychlos and retake their planet. An amused
   Terl shows Jonnie the ruins of Denver and its public library and boasts
   that the Psychlos conquered all of Earth in only nine minutes early in
   the 21st century. Jonnie spends time in the library and is particularly
   inspired by the Declaration of Independence.

   Terl gives Jonnie a party of slaves and a Psychlo flying shuttle and
   orders him to find gold. Jonnie locates a plentiful supply at the
   long-abandoned Fort Knox. He also discovers an abandoned underground
   military base with working Harrier jump-jets, weapons, and fuel. While
   they are supposed to be laboring in the mines, Jonnie and his followers
   plot a revolution, training themselves in aerial combat using the
   military base's flight simulators.

   After a week of training, the rebels launch their attack. In a suicide
   mission, Carlo flies his Psychlo flying shuttle into the Denver dome,
   destroying it and suffocating the Psychlos inside. Jonnie captures a
   teleportation device and uses it to teleport a dirty bomb to the
   Psychlo home world. When it detonates, the radiation it releases reacts
   catastrophically with the Psychlo atmosphere, destroying all life on
   the planet. The humans have retaken Earth, but face an uncertain
   future. The sole Psychlo survivor is Terl--who is imprisoned inside
   Fort Knox, in a makeshift cell of gold bars, as a bargaining chip in
   the event of a counterattack by Psychlos living off their
   homeworld--and Ker, who joins the victorious humans in their
   challenging project to rebuild their civilization.
