   In the mid-1960s, Oedipa Maas lives a fairly comfortable life in the
   (fictional) northern Californian village of Kinneret, despite her
   lackluster marriage with Mucho Maas, a rudderless radio jockey, and her
   sessions with Dr. Hilarius, an unhinged German psychotherapist who
   tries to medicate his patients with LSD. One day, Oedipa learns of the
   death of an ex-lover, Pierce Inverarity, an incredibly wealthy
   real-estate mogul, who has left her as the executor of his massive
   estate. Inverarity appears to have owned or financed nearly all the
   goings-on in San Narciso, a (fictional) southern Californian city near
   Los Angeles. Oedipa goes to San Narciso to meet Inverarity's lawyer, a
   former child actor named Metzger, and they begin an affair, which
   fascinates a local teenaged rock band, The Paranoids, who begin
   following them voyeuristically. At a bar, Oedipa notices the graffitied
   symbol of a muted post horn with the label "W.A.S.T.E.", and she chats
   with Mike Fallopian, a right-wing historian and critic of the postal
   system, who claims to use a secret postal service.
   The novel's ubiquitous muted post horn symbol

   It surfaces that Inverarity had Mafia connections, illicitly attempting
   to sell the bones of forgotten U.S. World War II soldiers for use as
   charcoal to a cigarette company. One of The Paranoids mentions that
   this strongly reminds him of a Jacobean revenge play he recently saw
   called The Courier's Tragedy. Intrigued by the coincidence, Oedipa and
   Metzger attend a performance of the play, which briefly mentions the
   name "Tristero". After the show, Oedipa approaches the play's director,
   Randolph Driblette, but he deflects her questions about the mention of
   the unusual name. After seeing a man scribbling the post horn symbol,
   Oedipa seeks out Mike Fallopian, who tells her he suspects a
   conspiracy. This is supported when watermarks of the muted horn symbol
   are discovered hidden on Inverarity's private stamp collection. The
   symbol appears to be a muted variant of the coat of arms of Thurn and
   Taxis: an 18th-century European postal monopoly that suppressed all
   opposition, including Trystero (or Tristero), a competing postal
   service that was defeated but possibly driven underground. Based on the
   symbolism of the mute, Oedipa theorizes that Trystero continues to
   exist as a countercultural secret society with unknown goals.

   She researches an older censored edition of The Courier's Tragedy,
   which confirms that Driblette indeed made a conscious choice to include
   the "Tristero" line. She seeks answers through a machine claimed to
   have psychic abilities, but the experience is awkward and unsuccessful.
   As she feverishly wanders the Bay Area, the muted post horn symbol
   appears among an engineer's doodles, as part of children's sidewalk
   drawings, amidst Chinese ideograms in a shop window, and in many other
   places. Finally, a nameless man at a gay bar tells her that the muted
   horn symbol simply represents an anonymous support group for people
   with broken hearts: Inamorati Anonymous. She directly witnesses people
   referring to and using mailboxes disguised as regular waste bins marked
   with "W.A.S.T.E." (later suggested to be an acronym for "We Await
   Silent Tristero's Empire"). Even so, Oedipa sinks into paranoia,
   wondering if Trystero actually exists or if she is merely overthinking
   a series of false clues with no definite connections.

   Fearing for her sanity, Oedipa makes an impromptu visit to Dr.
   Hilarius, only to find him having lost his own mind, firing a gun
   randomly and raving madly about his days as a Nazi medical intern at
   Buchenwald. She helps the police subdue him, only to return home to
   find that her husband Mucho has lost his mind in his own way, having
   become addicted to LSD. Oedipa consults an English professor about The
   Courier's Tragedy, learns that Randolph Driblette has mysteriously
   committed suicide, and is left pondering whether Trystero is simply a
   prolonged hallucination, an actual historical plot, or some elaborate
   practical joke that Inverarity arranged for her before his death. The
   book ends with Oedipa at an auction of Inverarity's possessions,
   waiting on the bidding of lot 49, which contains his stamp collection.
   Having learned that a particular bidder is interested in the stamps,
   she hopes to discover if this person is a representative of the
   Trystero secret society.
