   Pavane is an alternative history science fiction fix-up novel by
   British writer Keith Roberts, first published by Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd
   in 1968. Most of the original stories were published in Science
   Fantasy. An additional story, "The White Boat", was added in later
   editions.

   Comprising a cycle of linked stories set in Dorset, England, it depicts
   a 20th century in which the Roman Catholic Church still has supremacy;
   in its timeline, Protestantism was destroyed during wars that resulted
   from the aftermath of the assassination of Queen Elizabeth in 1588.
