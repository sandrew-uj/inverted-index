   Dr. Roy Auckland has been asked by Dr. Howard James to come with him on
   an archaeological expedition to the planet Carolus. As a communications
   expert, Roy will deal with the Vaec, roly-poly humanoids who talk like
   characters out of an old Charlie Chan movie. A simple people, the Vaec
   judge everything by its contribution to mirth and they enjoy playing
   harmless pranks on each other and on the Terrans. Roy also serves
   covertly as a detective searching for an assassin.

   Shortly after coming to Carolus Roy discovers that someone has poisoned
   Dr. James' soup. The attempted poisoning was discovered and thwarted by
   one of the Vaec, who smelled the poison. Sometime later a time bomb,
   clearly meant for Dr. James, explodes harmlessly. Apparently someone is
   trying to murder Dr. James and is being downright amateurish about it.
   Roy wants to prevent that someone from succeeding. As in any good
   murder mystery, Roy has the intended victim and a list of suspects:
     * Dr. Howard James; leader of the expedition, he has spent his career
       trying to remove the stigma of having been the assistant of an
       archaeologists who perpetrated a fraud reminiscent of the Piltdown
       Man hoax of the early twentieth century.
     * Amanda James; Dr. James' philandering wife
     * Dr. Kenneth Glamis; a cynic who questions the validity of almost
       everything anyone, especially Dr. James, says. He seems especially
       testy because he must wear an all-covering suit to protect him from
       the ultraviolet radiation coming through Carolus' atmosphere.
     * Calvin Burleigh; a religious fanatic, who believes that Terrans
       should not contact alien peoples and corrupt those peoples with
       their degenerate ways. He opposed Dr. James' expedition before
       joining it.
     * Captain Walter Edholm; in charge of the labor force, recruited from
       the Vaec. He doesn't seem to have any animosity toward anybody, but
       he doesn't trust the Vaec and wants to leave Carolus.
     * Shirley Mason; the expedition's secretary-typist. She gave up a
       promising career in space services to come to Carolus and Roy can't
       understand why. He discovers the reason as he investigates the
       first actual murder.

   Not long after Roy has his list made up and has asked four of the Vaec
   to watch the building in which the Terrans reside, one person on the
   list is murdered. It was made to look like an accident, as if the
   victim had been stung by one of the local insects, but Roy discovers
   that the murder was executed by a very clever trap that apparently had
   been set for Dr. James. After interrogating the Vaec observers Roy
   feels that he has all of the clues necessary to solve the murder, but
   he can't yet see the pattern.

   Later Roy goes to the Vaec village, where the aliens subject him to
   several tests that reveal to him a procedural error that he's been
   making in his investigation. He also discovers that the Vaec are
   teledynes, that they possess the power of telepathy and the ability to
   teleport objects. As Roy returns to the Terran base the murderer
   attempts to kill him, but the Vaec thwart the attempt.

   At last Roy solves the mystery and, in good murder mystery fashion, he
   gathers all of the participants together to reveal the killer. At the
   same time the Vaec reveal that they are long-lived members of a highly
   advanced civilization and that they are cutting off all contact with
   Terrans until the Terrans properly fulfill their potential.
