   In The Lyre of Orpheus, the executors of the will of Francis Cornish
   (the subject of What's Bred in the Bone) find themselves at the head of
   the "Cornish Foundation". The directors of the Foundation, who are the
   three remaining Frank Cornish's estate executors, being Professor the
   Reverend Simon Darcourt, Arthur Cornish, and Maria Cornish, plus
   Professor Clement Hollier and Stratford, Ontario actor Geraint Powell,
   are called upon to decide what projects deserve funding. They decide
   that an unfinished opera by E. T. A. Hoffmann will be finished and
   staged at Stratford; to this end, they hire a brilliant young
   composition student, Hulda Schnakenburg ("Schnak"), to complete the
   opera as her PhD. dissertation, while Darcourt is charged with the
   completion of the libretto, which James Planche had attempted to write.

   The opera to be completed is King Arthur or the Magnanimous Cuckold.
   The storyline follows the writing and then production of the opera, and
   the plot parallels the legend of King Arthur, and in particular the
   triangle of King Arthur, his queen, Guenevere, and Lancelot. Geraint
   Powell, using deception, fathers a child by Maria Cornish, forcing
   Arthur Cornish to choose between a generous or vindictive response. The
   Lyre of Orpheus not only explores the world of early eighteenth century
   opera, but also follows Darcourt's research into the life of the
   benefactor and artist Francis Cornish. Darcourt discovers that a
   painting of The Wedding at Cana, previously attributed to an unknown
   sixteenth century painter known only as "The Alchemical Master", was in
   fact the work of Francis Cornish himself, as described in the second
   book of the trilogy, What's Bred in the Bone. A further plotline
   involves the sexual and artistic flowering of Hulda Schnakenburg under
   the hand of Gunilla Dahl-Soot, a distinguished Swedish musicologist who
   serves as Schnak's academic advisor and becomes her lover.

   The book explores a number of themes, including the pursuit of life
   beyond the ordinary or comfortable routine, which is exemplified in the
   artistic quest to produce the opera and in Darcourt's quest to uncover
   the truth behind the painting of The Wedding at Cana. The theme of
   marriage is examined through the relationship between Arthur and Maria
   Cornish, a relationship tested by infidelity. And the modern approach
   to relationships is mocked in the dysfunctional common-law situation of
   two minor characters, Al and Mabel, who present themselves in Toronto
   to monitor and record the production of the opera from start to finish.

   As often happens in Davies' novels, all is not simple; for example, the
   ghost of Hoffman, trapped in Limbo as a result of the unsatisfactory
   state of his artistic work, attends and comments on the proceedings.
   Nor is all peaceful among the characters, as they react to Powell's
   seduction of Maria Cornish, Dahl-Soot's seduction of Schnak, and the
   tensions created by the effort to mount an operatic production.
