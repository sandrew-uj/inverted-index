   In an alternate 1930s world, a scientist is ordered by his dictator to
   create a robot in the apparent name of progress, and so the scientist
   creates the B.R.A.I.N., a highly intelligent robot. The dictator seizes
   it upon its apparent completion and turns it into the Fabrication
   Machine, an armature that can construct an army of war machines to
   destroy the dictator's enemies. But the B.R.A.I.N. is seized before the
   scientist can give it a soul, thus causing the Fabrication Machine to
   decide to exterminate all of Earth's population. The Fabrication
   Machine reprograms the created war machines to attack humanity, and
   proceed to wipe out all plant, animal and microbial life with toxic gas
   and chemical weapons. On the verge of destruction, the scientist uses
   alchemy to create nine homunculus-like rag dolls known as
   "Stitchpunks", giving them portions of his own soul via a talisman he
   created. He dies upon completion of the final doll.

   Some time later, the final Stitchpunk, 9, awakens in the workshop.
   Taking the talisman with him, 9 ventures into the devastated city and
   meets 2, a frail inventor who gives him a working voice box and is
   surprised to see the talisman. The last active machine, the Cat-Beast,
   attacks the pair and abducts both 2 and the talisman. 9 collapses, but
   awakens in Sanctuary, the tower of an empty cathedral that is home to
   other Stitchpunks - the dogmatic leader 1, his large bodyguard 8, the
   cycloptic engineer 5, and the mentally unstable oracle 6. 1 immediately
   declares 2 as dead, but 9, having seen the condemned factory where the
   Cat-Beast took him, decides to rescue him. 9 and 5 venture to the
   factory where they find 2. The Cat-Beast attacks the trio, but are
   saved by 7, the only female of the Stitchpunks. 9, drawn by curiosity,
   connects the talisman to the derelict Fabrication Machine, reviving it,
   and it subsequently kills 2 by sucking out his soul. 9, 5, and 7 manage
   to escape the factory.

   7 takes 9 and 5 to an abandoned library, where the silent scholar
   twins, 3 and 4, have taken residence, and show 9 the Fabrication
   Machine's origins. 5 realizes the talisman's symbols match the
   clairvoyant drawings of 6. 9 and 5 return to Sanctuary to investigate,
   but 1 intervenes and reprimands them for disobeying his orders.
   Meanwhile, the Fabrication Machine assembles new robotic creatures; one
   of them, the bird-like Winged Beast, attacks Sanctuary, leading to a
   battle between it and the Stitchpunks. 7 joins the fight, but is
   injured. The Stitchpunks win, defeating the Winged Beast, however, they
   lose their safe-house, as a fire had started during the fight.

   As the group retreats to the library, 6, 3, and 4 cryptically explain
   the talisman's origins, but 1 reveals to the group that he sent 2 out
   of Sanctuary on a scouting trip to die. 7, shocked by this, attacks 1,
   but flees when 9 intervenes. Meanwhile, the Fabrication Machine
   retrieves 2's corpse and uses it as a hypnotic lure for another one of
   its robot creatures, known as The Seamstress. The Seamstress attacks
   the library and captures both 7 and 8, but 2's body is recovered and
   given a funeral by the others. The others then run to the factory to
   destroy the machines. 9 goes in alone, kills the Seamstress, and
   rescues 7, but not before 8's soul is absorbed by the Fabrication
   Machine. 9 and 7 escape while the others destroy the factory.

   The Stitchpunks celebrate the destruction of the factory, but the
   Fabrication Machine, which survived, suddenly emerges from the ruins of
   the factory and absorbs 5's soul. The Fabrication Machine attacks the
   group as they run away and manages to capture 6. 6 tells 9 to go to the
   Scientist's workshop to find answers, before being absorbed by the
   Fabrication Machine. 9 follows 6's instructions, finding a holographic
   recorded message from the Scientist, explaining B.R.A.I.N.'s origins
   and that the Stitchpunks have his soul, making them the only hope for
   humanity. Following this revelation, 9 uncovers the purpose of the
   talisman and returns to his friends.

   9 reunites with the other Stitchpunks and decides to sacrifice himself
   so the others can retrieve the talisman. Having had a change of heart,
   1 redeems himself by saving 9, pushing him out of the way and allowing
   himself to be absorbed while 9 removes the talisman. 9 activates the
   talisman and reabsorbs the souls taken by the Machine, resulting in its
   final destruction. Afterwards, 9, 7, 3, and 4 free the souls of 5, 1,
   6, 2, and 8 from the talisman as they fly up into the sky, causing it
   to rain. The final image shows that the raindrops contain small flecks
   of glowing bacteria, bringing life back into the world.
