   The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette transport Rodger Young
   (named after Medal of Honor recipient Rodger Wilton Young),^[40]
   serving with the platoon known as "Rasczak's Roughnecks". The platoon
   carries out a raid against a planetary colony held by Skinnies.^[20]
   The raid is relatively brief: the platoon lands on the planet, destroys
   its targets, and retreats, suffering two casualties in the process. One
   of them, Dizzy Flores, dies while returning to orbit.^[41] The
   narrative then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school. Rico
   and his best friend Carl are considering joining the Federal Service
   after graduation; Rico is hesitant, partly due to his father's attitude
   towards the military.^[5] Rico makes his decision after discovering
   that his classmate Carmen Ibanez also intends to enlist.^[42]

   Rico's choice is taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves with a
   sense of estrangement. He is assigned to the Mobile Infantry, and moves
   to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the
   ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under
   Sergeant Charles Zim.^[43] The training is extremely demanding.^[44]
   Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights
   in armored suits.^[45]^[46] A fellow recruit is court-martialed,
   flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his
   company commander.^[47] Jean V. Dubois, who taught Rico's History and
   Moral Philosophy in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a
   Mobile Infantry veteran himself. The letter helps Rico stay motivated
   enough not to resign.^[48] Rico himself is given five lashes for firing
   a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear
   weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the
   blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a
   fellow soldier.^[49] Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after
   deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by
   civilian police.^[49] Eventually, after further training at another
   camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2,009 who
   had begun training in that regiment.^[50]

   The "Bug War" has changed from minor incidents to a full-scale war
   during Rico's training. An Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of
   Buenos Aires alerts civilians to the situation; Rico's mother is killed
   in the attack.^[51] Rico participates in the Battle of Klendathu, an
   attack on the Arachnid's home world, which turns into a disastrous
   defeat for the Terran Federation.^[52] Rico's ship, the Valley Forge,
   is destroyed, and his unit is decimated; he is reassigned to the
   Roughnecks on board the Rodger Young, led by Lieutenant Rasczak and
   Sergeant Jelal.^[53] The unit carries out several raids, and Rico is
   promoted to corporal by Jelal, after Rasczak dies in combat.^[54]

   One of his comrades in the Roughnecks suggests that Rico go to officer
   training school and try to become an officer. Rico ends up going to see
   Jelal, and finds that Jelal already had the paperwork ready. Rico
   enters Officer Candidate School for a second course of training,
   including further courses in "History and Moral Philosophy".^[55]^[56]
   En route from the Roughnecks to the school, Rico encounters his father,
   who has also enlisted and is now a corporal, and the two reconcile. He
   is also visited in school by Carmen, now an ensign and ship's pilot
   officer in the Navy, and the two discuss their friend Carl, who had
   been killed earlier in the war.^[57]

   Rico is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his final test: a
   posting to a combat unit. Under the tutelage of his company commander,
   Captain Blackstone, and with the aid of his platoon sergeant, his boot
   camp drill instructor Fleet Sergeant Zim, who was reassigned from
   Mobile Infantry boot camp , Rico commands a platoon during "Operation
   Royalty", a raid to capture members of the Arachnid brain caste and
   queens.^[58] Rico then returns to the officer school to graduate.

   The novel ends with him holding the rank of Second Lieutenant, in
   command of his old platoon in the Rodger Young, with his father as his
   platoon sergeant. The platoon has been renamed "Rico's Roughnecks", and
   is about to participate in an attack on Klendathu.^[59]
