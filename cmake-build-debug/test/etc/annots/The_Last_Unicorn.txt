   The story begins with a group of human hunters passing through a forest
   in search of game. After days of coming up empty-handed, they begin to
   believe they are passing through a Unicorn's forest, where animals are
   kept safe by a magical aura. They resign themselves to hunting
   somewhere else; but, before they leave, one of the hunters calls out a
   warning to the Unicorn that she may be the last of her kind. This
   revelation disturbs the Unicorn, and though she initially dismisses it,
   eventually doubt and worry drive her to leave her forest. She travels
   through the land and discovers that humans no longer even recognize
   her; instead they see a pretty white mare. She encounters a talking
   butterfly who speaks in riddles and songs and initially dodges her
   questions about the other unicorns. Eventually, the butterfly issues a
   warning that her kind have been herded to a far away land by a creature
   known as the Red Bull. She continues to search for other unicorns.
   During her journey, she is taken captive by a traveling carnival led by
   the witch, Mommy Fortuna, who uses magical spells to create the
   illusion that regular animals are in fact creatures of myth and legend.
   The Unicorn finds herself the only true legendary creature among the
   group, save for the harpy, Celaeno. Schmendrick, a magician traveling
   with the carnival, sees the Unicorn for what she is, and he frees her
   in the middle of the night. The Unicorn frees the other creatures
   including Celaeno, who kills Mommy Fortuna and Rukh, her hunchbacked
   assistant.

   The Unicorn and Schmendrick continue traveling in an attempt to reach
   the castle of King Haggard, where the Red Bull resides. When
   Schmendrick is captured by bandits, the Unicorn comes to his rescue and
   attracts the attention of Molly Grue, the bandit leader's wife.
   Together, the three continue their journey and arrive at Hagsgate, a
   town under Haggard's rule and the first one he had conquered when he
   claimed his kingdom. A resident of Hagsgate named Drinn informs them of
   a curse that stated that their town would continue to share in
   Haggard's fortune until such a time that someone from Hagsgate would
   bring Haggard's castle down. Drinn goes on to claim that he discovered
   a baby boy in the town's marketplace one night in winter. He knew that
   the child was the one the prophecy spoke of, but he left the baby where
   he found it, not wanting the prophecy to come true. King Haggard found
   the baby later that evening and adopted it.

   Molly, Schmendrick and the Unicorn leave Hagsgate and continue toward
   Haggard's castle, but on their way they are attacked by the Red Bull.
   The Unicorn runs, but is unable to escape the bull. In an effort to aid
   her, Schmendrick unwittingly turns the Unicorn into a human woman.
   Confused by the change, the Red Bull gives up the pursuit and
   disappears. The change has disastrous consequences on the Unicorn, who
   suffers tremendous shock at the sudden feeling of mortality in her
   human body. Schmendrick tells the unicorn that he is immortal and that
   he cannot make real magic unless he is mortal, and encourages her to
   continue her quest. The three continue to Haggard's castle, where
   Schmendrick introduces the Unicorn as "Lady Amalthea" to throw off
   Haggard's suspicions. They manage to convince Haggard to allow them to
   serve him in his court, with the hopes of gathering clues as to the
   location of the other unicorns. During their stay, Amalthea is romanced
   by Haggard's adopted son, Prince Lir. Haggard eventually reveals to
   Amalthea that the unicorns are trapped in the sea for his own benefit,
   because the unicorns are the only things that make him happy. He then
   openly accuses Amalthea of coming to his kingdom to save the unicorns
   and says that he knows who she really is, but Amalthea has seemingly
   forgotten about her true nature and her desire to save the other
   unicorns.

   Following clues given to them by a cat, Molly, Schmendrick, and
   Amalthea find the entrance to the Red Bull's lair. Haggard and his
   men-at-arms attempt to stop them, but they manage to enter the bull's
   lair and are joined by Lir. When the Red Bull attacks them, Schmendrick
   changes Amalthea back to her original form. At this moment, Schmendrick
   joyfully becomes mortal. In an effort to save the Unicorn, Lir jumps
   into the bull's path and is trampled. Fueled by anger and sorrow, the
   Unicorn drives the bull into the sea. The other unicorns are freed, and
   they run back to their homes, with Haggard's castle falling in their
   wake. As the castle falls, its wreckage dissolves into mist before it
   even hits the ground, and nothing remains to indicate that a castle had
   ever been there.

   The Unicorn revives Lir with the healing touch of her horn. Now king
   after Haggard's death, he attempts to follow the Unicorn despite
   Schmendrick advising against it. As they pass through the now-ruined
   town of Hagsgate, they learn that Drinn is actually Lir's father, and
   that he had abandoned him in the marketplace on purpose to fulfill the
   prophecy. Realizing that he has new responsibilities as king after
   seeing the state of Hagsgate, Lir returns to rebuild it after
   accompanying Schmendrick and Molly to the outskirts of his kingdom. The
   Unicorn returns to her forest. She tells Schmendrick that she is
   different from all the other unicorns now, because she knows what it's
   like to feel love and regret. Schmendrick and Molly later come across a
   princess in trouble and he tells her to go to Lir because he is the
   hero to save her. Schmendrick and Molly leave this story into another
   as they sing a love song together.
