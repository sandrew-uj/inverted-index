   The Demolished Man is a science fiction police procedural set in a
   future where telepathy is common, although much of its effectiveness is
   derived from one individual having greater telepathic skill than
   another.

   In the 24th century, telepaths--called Espers or "peepers"--are
   integrated into all levels of society. They are classed according to
   their abilities.

   All Espers can telepathically communicate amongst themselves and the
   more powerful Espers can overwhelm their juniors. Telepathic ability is
   innate and inheritable but can remain latent and undetected in
   untrained persons. Once recognized, natural aptitude can be developed
   through instruction and exercise. There is a guild to improve Espers'
   telepathic skills, to set and enforce ethical conduct guidelines, and
   to increase the Esper population through intermarriage. Some latent
   telepaths are undiscovered, or are aware of their abilities but refuse
   to submit to Guild rule. Some are ostracized as punishment for breaking
   the rules. One character in the story suffers this fate for ten years,
   leaving him desperate for even vicarious contact with other telepaths.
