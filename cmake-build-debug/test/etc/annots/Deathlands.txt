   On the morning of January 20, 2001 the climax of the Cold War set the
   post-apocalyptic stage for the series. The end game began with a
   pre-emptive strike on Washington. Underground nuclear bombs were
   detonated from within the basement of the Soviet embassy, by an elite
   group of Spetsnaz operatives, destroying the central command structure
   and political system of the United States. For an indefinite period of
   time a nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union
   devastated both countries and subsequently the entire planet (but
   little details are known outside both countries). All manner of genetic
   contagions were released infecting the survivors of the firestorm with
   horrible illnesses. The remaining survivors lived harshly during a time
   of prolonged nuclear winter known as 'Skydark'. The geography, climate,
   and ecosystems of the world had changed dramatically. What was left of
   the United States came to be known as the Deathlands.

   100 years later civilization begins again: brutal, short lived, morally
   confused and crazed from mutation. Between the many hot spots are small
   plague pits ruled by power hungry individuals who have no limits in
   order to establish their rule and expand their influence. These
   individuals are known as the Barons. Their rabble pits are known as
   Villes and Baronies. Civilization unknowingly resembles the Dark Ages.
   Trading resumes between the villes: Jack (a regional currency), Jolt (a
   hallucinogenic mixture of Mescaline and Heroin) and slaves are the
   primary forms of currency. Life is a strange mixture of ancient history
   and limited technology that is scrapped from the 20th century. Military
   technology is the most prized possession of all; success is often
   measured by the number of bullets he or she possesses. A man named Ryan
   Cawdor leads a group of companions across the deathlands. Ryan has
   extremely secret knowledge of the 20th century. The understanding of
   hidden underground complexes, known as redoubts, that contains
   Teleportation technology. He and his companions guard this knowledge
   with their lives. The technology is called MAT-TRANS.

   Each novel usually begins with the companions arriving at a frequently
   unknown redoubt by MAT-TRANS. If the situation is impossible or hostile
   the companions can use the "last destination" feature of the
   transporter to return to the sending location. If the redoubt is
   unknown then the companions usually explore, looking for weapons and
   supplies which they rarely find. Sometimes they are lucky and find a
   working shower or stored food which they always utilize or take. The
   story picks up speed once the characters leave the redoubt and explore
   the surrounding countryside. Frequently the companions are captured or
   forced into a confrontation with the local barons. Each novel reveals a
   little of the characters' history, motivations and the regional
   location where they arrived.
