   Shortly after returning from the Asteroid Belt, David "Lucky" Starr
   learns that his Science Academy roommate Lou Evans had been sent to
   investigate trouble on Venus, but the Council of Science office on
   Venus has requested that he be recalled and investigated for
   corruption.

   As Starr and John "Bigman" Jones are shuttled to Venus, their pilots
   suffer an episode of paralysis, and Starr is required to keep their
   craft from smashing itself against the surface of the Venusian ocean.
   Afterwards, the pilots have no memory of the event.

   Upon reaching the Venusian city of Aphrodite, Starr and Bigman meet Dr.
   Mel Morriss, head of the Council of Science on Venus, who explains that
   Venusian scientists are perfecting strains of yeast that can be
   processed into luxury foods for export; whereas for six months there
   has been a growing series of incidents of bizarre behavior among the
   human colonists, often followed by amnesia. Morriss believes they are
   being telepathically controlled by an unknown enemy. Evans was sent to
   Venus to investigate, but was found with stolen data concerning a
   secret strain of yeast, and is under arrest. When Starr confronts him,
   Evans admits to having stolen the data, but refuses to explain further.
   While Starr is questioning him, word reaches them that a man is
   threatening to open an outside airlock, which will allow the ocean to
   flood Aphrodite.

   Starr, Bigman, and Morriss go to the airlock to deal with the crisis,
   where they meet the city's chief engineer, Lyman Turner, the inventor
   and owner of a laptop computer carried with him. While Bigman goes
   through the ventilation ducts to cut power to the airlock door, Starr
   realizes that the airlock crisis is a feint and hastens to Council
   headquarters, to find that Evans has escaped custody and left Aphrodite
   in a submarine.

   Starr and Bigman pursue Evans in another submarine, eventually finding
   him and learning that the V-frogs are the source of the telepathic
   incidents; Evans having tested this hypothesis by stealing the secret
   data on the yeast strain, and interesting the V-frogs therein with the
   result of an accident involving that strain. Evans further reveals that
   the V-frogs have trapped himself and the other protagonists beneath an
   enormous deep-sea orange patch, which will attack them if they attempt
   escape.

   Starr, in response, leaves the submarine and uses an electric shock to
   destroy the orange patch's heart, killing it. He then returns to the
   submarine, and pilots this to the surface of the ocean, where he
   intends to communicate his findings to an orbiting space station to be
   relayed to the Council on Earth.

   On the surface, the V-frogs communicate telepathically with him,
   telling him they intend to take over the minds of the humans on Venus.
   Initially they keep him away from the radio; but he is able to distract
   them and transmit his message. Returning to Aphrodite, Starr explains
   to Morriss that the V-frogs' telepathy is used by a human individual to
   attempt control over the rest of humanity, and that the means of doing
   so is Lyman Turner's computer. Bigman destroys the computer and Starr
   captures Turner, hoping to re-create his computer in the interest of
   reforming Turner himself.
