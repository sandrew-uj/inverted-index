   Miles Vorkosigan is trying to woo the recently widowed Ekaterin
   Vorsoisson, but fearing that an open approach would drive her away, he
   takes an indirect approach: to get to see her frequently and knowing of
   her ambition to become a landscape designer, he hires her to design a
   garden beside Vorkosigan House.

   His clone brother Mark also has romance problems. He and Kareen
   Koudelka became lovers in Beta Colony, but the sexual mores of
   conservative Barrayar are much stricter, and she keeps their
   relationship a secret from her family.

   A significant subplot involves Mark's first entrepreneurial venture: an
   ugly genetically engineered insect called the "butter bug," capable of
   eating all kinds of waste organic material and regurgitating a
   nutritious goo that Miles calls "bug vomit".

   Meanwhile, two seats on the powerful Council of Counts are up for
   grabs, one because the current Count Vorbretten has been found to be
   part Cetagandan, dating back to the days of the Cetagandan occupation
   of Barrayar. The vacancy created by the death of Pierre Vorrutyer is
   contested by a distant cousin, Richars, and Pierre's sister, Donna, who
   undergoes gender reassignment surgery on Beta Colony, becoming a fully
   functional man and taking the name Dono, in order to seek the title.
