   The Beautiful and Damned tells the story of Anthony Patch in 1910s New
   York, a socialite and presumptive heir to a tycoon's fortune; his
   complicated marriage to Gloria Gilbert; the couple's troubling
   experience with wealth and status; his brief service in the Army during
   World War I; and Anthony and Gloria's journey through alcoholism and
   partying. Gloria and Anthony's story deals with the hardships
   of a relationship, especially when they are each pitted against the
   other's selfish attitudes. Once the couple's infatuation with each
   other fades, they begin to see their differences that do more harm than
   good, as well as leaving each other with some unfulfilled hopes.

   Toward the end of the novel, Fitzgerald summarizes the plot and his
   intentions in writing it, even referring to his own first novel, when a
   financially successful writer friend tells Anthony:

     "You know these new novels make me tired. My God! Everywhere I go
     some silly girl asks me if I've read This Side of Paradise. Are our
     girls really like that? If it's true to life, which I don't believe,
     the next generation is going to the dogs. I'm sick of all this
     shoddy realism. I think there's a place for the romanticist in
     literature."
