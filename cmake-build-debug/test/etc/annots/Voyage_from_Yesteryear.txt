   The story opens early in the 21st century, as an automated space probe
   is being prepared for a mission to explore habitable exoplanets in the
   Alpha Centauri system. However, Earth appears destined for a global war
   which the probe designers fear that humanity may not survive. It
   appears that the only chance for the human species is to reestablish
   itself far away from the conflict but there is no time left for a
   manned expedition to escape Earth. The team, led by Henry B. Congreve,
   change their mission priority and quickly modify the design to carry
   several hundred sets of electronically coded human genetic data. Also
   included in this mission of embryo space colonization is a databank of
   human knowledge, robots to convert the data into genetic material and
   care for the children and construct habitats when the destination is
   reached, and a number of artificial wombs. The probe's designers name
   it the Kuan-Yin after the bodhisattva of childbirth and compassion.

   Shortly after the launch, global war indeed breaks out and several
   decades later, Earthbound humanity is united under an authoritarian
   government. It is this government that receives a radio message from
   the fledgling "Chironian" civilization revealing that the probe found a
   habitable planet (Chiron) and that the first generation of children
   have been raised successfully.

   As the surviving power blocs of Earth before the conflict are still
   evident, North America, Europe and Asia each send a generation ship to
   Alpha Centauri to take control of the colony. By the time that the
   first generation ship (the American Mayflower II) arrives after 20
   years, Chironian society is in its fifth generation.

   The Mayflower II has brought with it thousands of settlers, all the
   trappings of the authoritarian regime along with bureaucracy, religion,
   fascism and a military presence to keep the population in line.
   However, the planners behind the generation ship did not anticipate the
   direction that Chironian society took: in the absence of conditioning
   and with limitless robotic labor and fusion power, Chiron has become a
   post-scarcity economy. Money and material possessions are meaningless
   to the Chironians and social standing is determined by individual
   talent, which has resulted in a wealth of art and technology without
   any hierarchies, central authority or armed conflict.

   In an attempt to crush this anarchist adhocracy, the Mayflower II
   government employs every available method of control; however, in the
   absence of conditioning the Chironians are not even capable of
   comprehending the methods, let alone bowing to them. The Chironians
   simply use methods similar to Gandhi's satyagraha and other forms of
   nonviolent resistance to win over most of the Mayflower II crew
   members, who had never previously experienced true freedom, and isolate
   the die-hard authoritarians.

   Frustrated with their lack of success, the authoritarian faction stages
   a military coup on board the Mayflower II and launches the ship's
   heavily armed "battle module", threatening to attack unless they submit
   to a military dictatorship. Having isolated the authoritarians, the
   Chironians destroy the module with an antimatter particle beam weapon.
   The remainder of the crew dissolve their government and join Chironian
   society. The week after, the laser communications beam to the Mayflower
   II cuts off, having been destroyed in another global war that had taken
   place 4.5 years ago.

   The epilogue is set five years after these events and shows that the
   Chironians also assimilated the crews of the Asian and European
   starships. Now united, the Chironians refit and recommission the
   Mayflower II with an advanced antimatter drive and rename it the Henry
   B. Congreve. The Henry B. Congreve is sent back to Earth to rebuild
   human civilization (with the new drive, this journey will only take
   eight years), fulfilling the Kuan-Yin's mission of preserving humanity.
