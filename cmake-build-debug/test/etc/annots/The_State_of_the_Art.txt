     * "Road of Skulls"

                Two men in a carriage travel over the eponymous Road of
                Skulls, to reach a distant City that seems to be
                constantly retreating and producing the infinite road.

     * "A Gift from the Culture"

                A man in self-imposed exile from the Culture is pressured
                into committing an act of terrorism with the help of
                Culture technology.

     * "Odd Attachment"

                A lovesick alien encounters a humanoid explorer, and
                mutilates it in a game of "loves me, loves me not."

     * "Descendant"

                A Culture soldier and his sapient spacesuit struggle to
                survive after being shot down and crash-landing on a
                barren planet.

     * "Cleaning Up"

                An alien race discovers that a faulty teleporter has been
                sending junk onto the surface of Earth instead of the Sun,
                where scientists from across the world have been studying
                these "Gifts." The aliens covertly work with national
                authorities to recover the futuristic technologies. The
                last Gift to arrive is the malfunctioning teleporter
                itself, which the United States attempts to use for a
                first strike against the USSR. The teleporter fails and
                randomly sends nuclear devices across the world,
                devastating several nations.

     * "Piece"

                A commentary on religion and fundamentalism in the form of
                a recovered letter from the Lockerbie disaster.

     * "The State of the Art"

                At 100 pages long, the title novella makes up the bulk of
                the book. The novella chronicles a Culture mission to
                Earth in the late 1970s, and also serves as a prequel of
                sorts to Use of Weapons by featuring two of that novel's
                characters, Diziet Sma and the drone Skaffen-Amtiskaw.
                Here, Sma argues for contact with Earth, to try to fix the
                mess the human species has made of it; another Culture
                citizen, Linter, goes native, choosing to renounce his
                Culture body enhancements so as to be more like the
                locals; and Li, who is a Star Trek fan, argues that the
                whole "incontestably neurotic and clinically insane
                species" should be eradicated with a micro black hole. The
                ship Arbitrary has ideas, and a sense of humour, of its
                own.

                            'Also while I'd been away, the ship had sent a
                            request on a postcard to the BBC's World
                            Service, asking for 'Mr David Bowie's "Space
                            Oddity" for the good ship Arbitrary and all
                            who sail in her.' (This from a machine that
                            could have swamped Earth's entire
                            electro-magnetic spectrum with whatever the
                            hell it wanted from somewhere beyond
                            Betelgeuse.) It didn't get the request played.
                            The ship thought this was hilarious.'^[2]
