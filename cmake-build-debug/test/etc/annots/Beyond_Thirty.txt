   The story was heavily influenced by the events of World War I, and
   reflects U.S. sentiments at the time of writing. When the war broke
   out, Americans were predominantly isolationist and wary of being drawn
   into a European war. Burroughs imagines a future two centuries onward
   in which that view prevailed and the western hemisphere severed contact
   with the rest of the world. Consequently, the eastern hemisphere has
   exhausted itself in war and Europe has descended into barbarism while
   the Americas, sheltered from the destruction, have continued to advance
   and joined peacefully into the union of Pan-America. By the
   twenty-second century the entire world east of the 30th meridian west
   and west of the 175th meridian west has become terra incognita to
   Pan-America.

   In 2137, Pan-American Navy Lieutenant Jefferson Turck is commander of
   the aero-submarine Coldwater, tasked with patrolling the 30th meridian
   from Iceland to the Azores. Disaster strikes when the vessel's
   anti-gravitation screens fail, dooming it to wallow upon the surface of
   the ocean, and the engines fail, leaving it adrift. As its wireless
   radio has failed as well, Turck cannot even summon help. While the crew
   attempts repairs Turck and three subordinates, Snider, Taylor and
   Delcarte, go fishing in a small boat to reprovision the vessel. While
   they are out the Coldwater is successfully repaired and flies off,
   leaving the fishermen to their fate. It is implied that Turck's second
   officer Alvarez, who has clashed with his superior, is behind both the
   original sabotage and subsequent abandonment.

   Adrift, Turck and his companions are forced to make shore in forbidden
   England. They find it a wilderness inhabited by savages and overrun by
   lions descended from zoo animals. The British royal family has been
   reduced to the precarious leadership of a small tribe based near the
   ruins of London. While out hunting Turck rescues Victory, daughter of
   the king, from the henchmen of Buckingham, a local strongman who has
   killed her father. He tries to return her to her family, only to fall
   himself into Buckingham's hands. The two escape and flee to London,
   where they find evidence that Great Britain had fallen fully two
   hundred years before; the Great War had destroyed the Old World's
   civilization in less than a quarter century.

   Turck and Victory join the other Americans, and the combined party
   sails to the European mainland, also reduced to savagery. There Snider
   dies after attempting to seize Victory for himself. Soon after, Turck
   and Victory fall separately into the hands of soldiers of the
   Abyssinian Empire, a black super-state now ruling all of Africa, most
   of Europe, and the Arabian Peninsula. While the Abyssinians' technology
   is roughly equivalent to that of the nineteenth century, it is more
   than a match for the white savages populating Europe. The Abyssinians
   consider whites a lower order and take them as slaves. Turck too is
   pressed into slavery, becoming the personal servant of Belik, an
   Abyssinian colonel.

   Turck's master takes him to New Gondar, built on the site of ancient
   Berlin, where the Abyssinian Emperor, Menelek XIV, holds court. Menelek
   is portrayed as gross and cruel--perhaps once a great man, but now
   corrupted by power. Turck watches powerlessly as white slave women are
   offered to the emperor for his harem, including his love interest
   Victory. Turck rescues Victory during an attack on New Gondar by the
   forces of China, which have been advancing into Europe from the east.
   The couple is captured by the invaders, but made honored guests once
   the Chinese have heard their story. They are taken to the Chinese base
   on the site of old Moscow, and eventually by rail to Peking, where the
   two wed.

   Meanwhile, back in Pan-America, Turck's mutinous subordinate Alvarez
   has been arrested, the ban on travel to the Eastern Hemisphere
   rescinded, and a search and rescue expedition mounted. Taylor and
   Delcarte are found, communications between the hemispheres are
   re-opened, and diplomatic relations established between Pan-America and
   China, with commerce to follow. Turck, hailed as a hero, makes plans to
   restore Victory to her British throne.
