   Nine years after Emperor Paul Muad'Dib walked into the desert, blind,
   the ecological transformation of Dune has reached the point where some
   Fremen are living without stillsuits in the less arid climate and have
   started to move out of the sietches and into the villages and cities.
   As the old ways erode, more and more pilgrims arrive to experience the
   planet of Muad'Dib. The Imperial high council has lost its political
   might and is powerless to control the Jihad.

   Paul's young twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, have concluded that
   their guardian Alia has succumbed to Abomination--possession by her
   grandfather Baron Vladimir Harkonnen--and fear that a similar fate
   awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the terraforming of Dune
   will kill all the sandworms, thus destroying the source of the spice,
   but Harkonnen desires this outcome. Leto also fears that, like his
   father, he will become trapped by his prescience.

   Meanwhile, a new religious figure called "The Preacher" has risen in
   the desert, railing against the religious government's injustices and
   the changes among the Fremen. Some Fremen believe he is Paul Atreides.
   Princess Wensicia of the fallen House Corrino on Salusa Secundus plots
   to assassinate the twins and regain power for her House.

   Lady Jessica, Alia and Paul's mother, returns to Arrakis and recognizes
   that her daughter is possessed, but finds no signs of Abomination in
   the twins. Leto arranges for Fremen leader Stilgar to protect his
   sister if there is an attempt on their lives. The Preacher journeys to
   Salusa Secundus to meet Wensicia's son Farad'n, and in return pledges
   Duncan Idaho as an agent of House Corrino. Alia attempts to assassinate
   Jessica, who escapes into the desert with Duncan's help, precipitating
   a rebellion among the Fremen. The twins anticipate and survive the
   Corrino assassination plot. Leto leaves to seek out the Preacher, while
   Ghanima, changing her memory with self-hypnosis, reports (and believes)
   that her brother has been murdered. Duncan and Jessica flee to Salusa
   Secundus, where Jessica begins to mentor Farad'n. He seizes power from
   his regent mother Wensicia and allies with the Bene Gesserit, who
   promise to marry him to Ghanima and support his bid to become Emperor.

   A band of Fremen outlaws capture Leto and force him to undergo the
   spice trance at the suggestion of Gurney Halleck, who has infiltrated
   the group on Jessica's orders. Leto's spice-induced visions show him a
   myriad of possible futures where humanity becomes extinct and only one
   where it survives. He names this future "The Golden Path" and resolves
   to bring it to fruition--something that his father, who had already
   glimpsed this future, refused to do. He escapes his captors and
   sacrifices his humanity in pursuit of the Golden Path by physically
   fusing with a school of sandtrout, gaining superhuman strength and
   near-invulnerability. He travels across the desert and confronts the
   Preacher, who is indeed Paul.

   Duncan returns to Arrakis and provokes Stilgar into killing him so that
   Stilgar is forced to take Ghanima and go into hiding. Alia recaptures
   Ghanima and arranges her marriage to Farad'n, planning to exploit the
   expected chaos when Ghanima kills him to avenge her brother's murder.
   The Preacher and Leto return to the capital to confront Alia. Upon
   arriving, Paul is murdered, to Alia's horror. Leto reveals himself in a
   display of superhuman strength and triggers the return of Ghanima's
   genuine memories. He confronts Alia and offers to help her overcome her
   possession, but Harkonnen resists. Alia manages to commit suicide by
   throwing herself off a high balcony.

   Leto declares himself Emperor and asserts control over the Fremen.
   Farad'n enlists in his service and delivers control of the Corrino
   armies. Leto marries his sister Ghanima to further his goals, but
   Farad'n is her true consort so the Atreides line can continue.
