   Set thousands of years in the future (AD 5407), the human race has been
   conquered by the Qax, a truly alien turbulent-liquid form of life, who
   now rule over the few star systems of human space - adopting processes
   from human history to effectively oppress the resentful race. Humans
   have encountered a few other races, including the astoundingly advanced
   Xeelee, and been conquered once before - by the Squeem - but
   successfully recovered.^[4]

   A human-built device, the Interface project, returns to the solar
   system after 1,500 years. The project, towed by the spaceship Cauchy,
   returns a wormhole gate, appearing to offer time travel due to the time
   'difference' between the exits of the wormhole (relativistic time
   dilation), with one end having remained in the solar system and the
   other travelling at near lightspeed for a century. The Qax had
   destroyed the solar system gate, but a lashed-up human ship (a great
   chunk of soil including Stonehenge, crewed by a group called the
   Friends of Wigner) passes through the returning gate, travelling back
   to the unconquered humanity of 1,500 years ago.

   One of the crew of the Cauchy returns with the Friends, Miriam Berg.
   The Friends have a complex scheme, which does not include a simple
   military return-and-rescue - the 1,500-year technology gap makes this
   "risible". From the Wigner thought experiment they have postulated an
   unusual theory on the ultimate destiny of life in the universe. They
   believe that quantum wave-functions do not collapse like the Copenhagen
   interpretation holds, nor that each collapse actually buds off separate
   universes (like the quantum multiverse hypothesis holds) but rather
   that the universe is a participatory universe: the entire universe
   exists as a single massive quantum superposition, and that at the end
   of time (in the open universe of the Xeelee Sequence, time and space
   are unbounded, or more precisely, bounded only at the Cauchy boundaries
   of "Time-like infinity" and "Space-like infinity"), when intelligent
   life has collected all information (compare the Final anthropic
   principle and the Omega Point), and transformed into an "Ultimate
   Observer", will make the "final Observation", the observation which
   collapses all the possible entangled wave-functions generated since the
   beginning of the universe. They believe further that the Ultimate
   Observer will not merely observe, but choose which world line will be
   the true world-line, and that it will choose the one in which humanity
   suffers no Squeem or Qax occupations. However, the Ultimate Observer
   cannot choose between worldlines if no information survives to its era
   to distinguish worldlines- if the UO never knows of humanity, it cannot
   choose a worldline favourable to it. In other words, some way is needed
   to securely send information forward in time.

   As a consequence of this necessity, they intend to turn Jupiter into a
   carefully formed singularity and use the precisely specified parameters
   as a method of encoding information. Miriam Berg is more concerned over
   the immediate fate of humanity, with the threat of the future Qax, and
   transmits a 'help' message to the gate designer Michael Poole.

   The Qax, naturally, panic a little at the escape to the past. A
   complex, unavoidably fragile species in their huge living Spline
   spacecraft, the few Qax present are somewhat at a loss. They decide to
   build their own Interface, with major human-collaborator assistance
   (headed by Ambassador Jasoft Parz), to create a link to their future to
   gain aid in resolving the problem - with more modern GUT-engine
   spacecraft they can make a 500-year link in just eighteen months. A
   startling high-technology future vessel (in truth, one of the legendary
   Xeelee nightfighters, an advanced and long-range fast scout ship), with
   a future Qax comes through the gate. Its first act is to execute the
   Qax Governor of Earth and gather up Parz, before passing through the
   original portal after the Friends and all humanity. The future Qax
   takes two Spline ships (presumably leaving behind the nightfighter;
   this might be the nightfighter that is discovered by the crew of The
   Great Northern millennia later in Ring) through the gate and on the
   journey reveals to Parz the reason behind its desire to completely
   destroy the human race.
