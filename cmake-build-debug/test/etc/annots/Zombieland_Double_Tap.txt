   Six years after the events of the first film, survivors Tallahassee,
   Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock have become experts in identifying
   and disposing of various zombies. Since then, they have set up their
   new home in the abandoned White House.They have also come across new
   strains of zombies, including "Homers" (very slow with no actual drive
   to feed), "Hawkings" (smarter than your average flesh-eater), and
   "Ninjas" (hides in the shadows waiting for the right time to kill.)
   Columbus decides to propose to Wichita using the Hope Diamond, while
   Tallahassee rebuffs Little Rock's hopes of finding people her own age.
   The next morning, Tallahassee finds a note from Wichita and Little
   Rock. The girls took off after feeling too attached/repressed
   respectively to the men, in Tallahassee's heavily modified presidential
   limousine he lovingly calls "The Beast."

   A month later, while exploring a mall, Columbus is mourning his
   relationship with Wichita. Tallahassee, claiming Native American blood
   runs through his veins, is ready to head out on his own. Columbus is
   startled by a ditzy blonde named Madison, who has survived Zombieland
   by hiding inside the freezer of a Pinkberry store. Columbus invites her
   back to the White House, much to Tallahassee's annoyance, where Madison
   pounces on Columbus and the two have sex. Returning and discovering
   Columbus has slept with Madison, Wichita explains that Little Rock has
   left for Graceland with a pacifist from Berkeley, with no weapons save
   for "The Beast". Fearing for Little Rock's safety, the group heads
   toward Graceland in a rundown minivan, including Madison.

   While trying to switch vehicles and secure an abandoned RV, they fight
   off another horde of zombies. Madison appears to be scratched on the
   foot by a "Ninja" and is saved by Columbus. The last zombie in the
   bunch is a new strain of super-zombie that takes multiple gunshots to
   kill, leading Columbus to nickname it the "T-800" after the Terminator
   franchise. They fail to secure the RV and retreat back to the minivan.
   Madison begins to show signs of "zombification," such as pale, flushed
   skin, deforming facial features, and uncontrollable vomiting. This
   forces them to pull to the side of the road so Columbus could lead her
   into the forest to shoot her.

   The trio finally arrive at Graceland days later, only to find it in
   ruins. Little Rock, Berkeley and "The Beast" are nowhere in sight.
   Tallahassee, a great admirer of the Elvis Presley, is broken hearted
   and pushes them to drive away. Further down the road they discover "The
   Beast," at a nearby Elvis-themed motel. The place is run by a
   gun-slinging survivor named Nevada, who reveals Little Rock and
   Berkeley took another vehicle toward Babylon, a hippie commune. Bonding
   over their love of Elvis, Nevada and Tallahassee spend the night
   together.

   In the morning they are awakened to find "The Beast" being crushed by a
   monster truck driven by Nevada's friends Albuquerque and Flagstaff, who
   strongly resemble Tallahassee and Columbus in physical appearance and
   personality. Albuquerque and Tallahassee argue over Nevada while
   Flagstaff and Columbus compare "commandments" and "rules" for surviving
   a zombie apocalypse. T-800s soon appear in the driveway. Albuquerque
   and Flagstaff, trying to one-up the others, fight them alone. Almost
   immediately, however, they both exhibit signs of "zombification" and
   reveal they were bitten. The group is forced to fight the T-800 version
   of their counterparts. While proving to be severely difficult, they
   successfully kill the zombies. They hit the road again, this time
   heading for Babylon.

   During an intimate conversation between Columbus and Wichita about
   their relationship, the group finds Madison, alive and well, driving an
   ice cream truck heading in the same direction. She rejoins the group
   and explains that her nut allergy caused symptoms similar to
   zombification. Instead of shooting her, Columbus spared her in the
   forest, shooting above her head to try and scare her off. They arrive
   at Babylon, begrudgingly giving up their weapons, and find Little Rock.
   A satisfied Tallahassee departs, only to find a horde of super zombies
   attracted by the commune's fireworks and drives back to warn everybody.
   Left without guns, Tallahassee devises a plan to kill the zombies with
   exploding biodiesel and then have commune members, armed with barricade
   shields, corral the stragglers off of a skyscraper with himself as the
   bait.

   The zombie horde is more massive than expected, the exploding biodiesel
   is ineffective and the group is surrounded and almost overwhelmed.
   Nevada arrives in Albuquerque's monster truck, rescuing the group. They
   are able to take out several of the T-800s before the vehicle soon
   rolls over and they can't get it back up. Escaping upstairs, the
   survivors corral the zombies off the roof. Tallahassee uses a
   construction crane hook to dangle just out of reach, but the last two
   zombies seize his leg as they fall. Little Rock shoots them with a
   pistol given to her earlier by Tallahassee, rescuing him. The two
   reconcile and Wichita accepts Columbus' proposal of marriage. Little
   Rock breaks up with Berkeley, who hooks up with Madison. The original
   quartet leaves Babylon, joined by Nevada. Columbus remarks that they
   have finally found their home in each other.

   In a mid-credits scene set during the start of the zombie outbreak in
   2009, Bill Murray witnesses Al Roker turn into a Zombie during an
   interview promoting the fictional Garfield 3: Flabby Tabby. Before
   making his escape, he kills multiple zombies, including zombie versions
   of Grace Randolph and Lili Estefan. In a post-credits scene, an outtake
   of Murray causing the cast to break character while he coughs up a
   hairball is shown.
