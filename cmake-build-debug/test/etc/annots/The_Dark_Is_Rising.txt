   Will Stanton begins to have strange experiences on his 11th birthday,
   just before Christmas. He soon learns he is one of the Old Ones, a
   guardian and warrior for the Light, who must help find the four Things
   of Power for the Light in order to battle the forces of the Dark. The
   first of these Things of Power is the Circle of Six Signs (magical
   mandalas). Will collects the six signs which become the Circle of
   Signs, by finding the additional five mandalas (he has been given one
   earlier) and uses the completed Circle to ward off the forces of the
   Dark.

   This book is where the protagonist Will Stanton, a main character in
   The Dark is Rising Sequence, is introduced. The book features elements
   of British folklore that are especially associated with the Thames
   Valley, with Herne the Hunter making an appearance.
