   The story revolves around five humans: Jake, Marco, Cassie, Rachel and
   Tobias, and one alien, Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill (nicknamed Ax), who
   obtain the ability to transform into any animal they touch. Naming
   themselves "Animorphs" (a portmanteau of "animal morphers"),^[6] they
   use their ability to battle a secret alien infiltration of Earth by a
   parasitic race of aliens resembling large slugs called Yeerks, that can
   take any living creatures as a host by entering and merging with their
   brain through the ear canal. The Animorphs fight as a guerilla force
   against the Yeerks who are led by Visser Three.

   Throughout the series, the Animorphs carefully protect their
   identities; the Yeerks assume that the Animorphs are a strike force
   sent by the Andalites, the alien race to which Ax belongs that created
   the transformation technology, to prevent them from conquering Earth.
   To protect their families from Yeerk reprisals, the Animorphs maintain
   this fac,ade.

   Though the Animorphs can assume the form of any animal they touch to
   acquire the DNA, there are several limitations to the ability. The most
   vital is that they cannot stay in animal form for more than two hours,
   or they will be unable to return to human form and the morphs become
   permanent. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between
   morphs, only tight clothing being able to be carried over with a morph,
   and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to
   prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming the human
   intellect. A benefit to morphing is that it allows the team to heal any
   superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph.
   Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone
   nearby.
