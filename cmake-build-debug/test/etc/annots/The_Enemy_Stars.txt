   The first ship that Humanity sent into interstellar space was the
   Southern Cross, sent on a four-and-a-half century voyage to Alpha
   Crucis. On autopilot she accelerated at over one hundred gees until she
   was flying away from Sol at half the speed of light. Then the autopilot
   shut down the ion drive, the ship went into free fall, and the first
   crew went into the mattercaster on Earth's moon to be teleported aboard
   the ship for their month-long tour of duty. Ten generations later, when
   she is one hundred light years from Sol, Southern Cross receives her
   last crew, though the four men who come through the mattercaster do not
   know that they are the last crew.

   Terangi Maclaren, an astrophysicist of Polynesian ancestry, has
   convinced officials of the Protectorate, the dictatorship under which
   he lives, to take a great risk. Previous crews have made observations
   indicating that Southern Cross will pass close enough to a burnt-out
   star that she could be diverted, decelerate, and go into orbit around
   it in order that the crew can make further studies. The risk comes from
   the fact that if the crew cannot find a roughly asteroid-sized body to
   provide feedstock for the mattercaster, the Exploration Authority will
   not be able to teleport enough mercury to the ship to provide enough
   propellant for Southern Cross to resume her journey to Alpha Crucis.
   More playboy than scientist, Maclaren is assigned to the mission he had
   promoted.

   David Ryerson is a graviticist/tachyonicist born and raised in
   Scotland's Outer Hebrides. He has just married an Indonesian woman,
   Tamara Suwito, and has brought her home to meet his father, Captain
   Magnus Ryerson. The couple are preparing to emigrate to a planet just
   opened for colonization, but Magnus demands that David first serve a
   tour on the Southern Cross. Reluctantly David agrees, if only for the
   extra pay.

   Seiichi Nakamura lives on Sarai, an Earth-like moon of a gas-giant
   planet in the 40 Eridani system. He has been selected to serve as
   Southern Cross's pilot and captain on this particular tour. Old traumas
   haunt him and his Zen discipline cannot relieve him of his fear of the
   dark star.

   Chang Sverdlov, on Krasna, one of the planets of Tau Ceti, has been
   assigned to be Southern Cross's engineer. Member of a nascent
   revolutionary movement, he is told to observe anything about the dead
   star that may be of military value. He is also being sent "out of town"
   to allay suspicions that are beginning to arise regarding his loyalty
   to the Protectorate.

   Maclaren and Ryerson travel from Earth to the moon together and from
   the moon teleport onto the Southern Cross. On the ship they find
   Nakamura and Sverdlov waiting for them and the four men immediately set
   to the tasks necessary to bring Southern Cross as close as possible to
   the dead star. As Nakamura backs the ship down its trajectory to put it
   into a close orbit around the star, the ion drive suddenly begins to
   vaporize itself and the mattercaster web: they have encountered
   interference from the star's magnetic field, which is far stiffer than
   anyone thought possible. In order to avoid crashing into the star
   Nakamura must fire the drive enough to put the ship into a stable
   orbit, doing so at the expense of further damage to the drive's ion
   accelerators and to the mattercaster web.

   After making the necessary inspections Sverdlov states that the drive
   can be repaired well enough that the ship can maneuver around the dead
   star as they need and Ryerson states that he can repair the
   mattercaster web only to a certain point. To make a full repair of the
   mattercaster, so that the men can go home, Ryerson needs four kilograms
   of pure germanium in order to build the large and complex transistors
   that the web needs. Sverdlov and Ryerson go outside to repair the drive
   and while Nakamura is testing the drive under Sverdlov's directions,
   Sverdlov slips and falls, breaches his spacesuit, and dies.

   Some months later the men find a planet, a ball of nickel-iron alloy a
   little smaller than Earth. From this planet's material they will
   extract the germanium that Ryerson needs. But first they must land
   Southern Cross on the planet and the ship was not meant to land on a
   planet. Using material scavenged from the ship's landers and other
   non-essential items, the three men build a tripod to protect the ion
   drive and the mattercaster web. Nakamura backs the ship down onto the
   planet, but one leg of the tripod buckles. Acting intuitively, Nakamura
   turns the ship to protect the mattercaster, but in so doing he puts the
   control turret he occupies directly under one thousand tonnes of
   crash-landing spaceship.

   For weeks Maclaren cuts pieces out of the planet's metal surface and
   Ryerson extracts the little germanium they contain. Even on short
   rations they are running out of food. They get the germanium they need,
   Ryerson makes his transistors and finishes repairing the web, and then
   the two men begin the task of using their uncalibrated mattercaster to
   find a resonance that will take them to another ship or base, whence
   they can be rescued.

   One day, as they are on the verge of starving to death, they find a
   resonance. In desperation Ryerson teleports himself to the receiver,
   leaving the more cautious Maclaren behind. Some time later Maclaren
   decides to follow Ryerson, but before he can do so Ryerson returns...
   draped across the arms of an alien wearing a spacesuit full of
   chlorine.

   Some months later, still recovering his health from his ordeal,
   Maclaren goes to Sumatra to meet Ryerson's widow and give her his few
   small personal possessions. He tells her that the alien had examined
   his cobbled-together mattercaster, had located and marked resonances
   that led to his people's ships or bases, and then teleported back to
   his own ship. It had taken another week for Maclaren to find the
   resonance that took him to a human base, whence he was rescued.

   Taking Tamara with him, Maclaren flies his aircar to the Outer
   Hebrides. She points out the house where Magnus Ryerson waits for them.
   Maclaren has come to tell Magnus about his son and to answer the old
   man's questions. Tamara's outburst, crying out the uselessness of going
   to the stars, touches Maclaren's own doubts. But Magnus simply says,
   "For that is our doom and our pride," quoting from Rudyard Kipling's
   poem "The Song of the Dead". Magnus goes on to read from that poem the
   stanza that begins, "We have fed our sea for a thousand years...."

   Maclaren understands then and asks Magnus for his blessing.
