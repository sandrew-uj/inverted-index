   In an 2013 interview with the New York Times, Brooks said he felt his
   literary agent had marketed the book as a parody, saying "How I think
   my agent pitched them was like, Mel Brooks's son, who has just won an
   Emmy for `S.N.L.,' wrote this unbelievable parody, tongue in cheek, he
   never breaks character. He's totally making fun of a zombie plague."
   However, he considered the book to be in the self-help genre, rather
   than humor, saying "I can't think of anything less funny than dying in
   a zombie attack."

   Brooks' second book, World War Z, is a follow-up to The Zombie Survival
   Guide. Brooks has stated that the zombies in World War Z obey the same
   laws described in The Zombie Survival Guide, and suggested that they
   may exist in the same fictional universe.
