   Lord Peter Wimsey's brother, the Duke of Denver, has taken a shooting
   lodge at Riddlesdale in Yorkshire. At 3 o'clock one morning, Captain
   Denis Cathcart, the fiance of Wimsey's sister Lady Mary, is found shot
   dead just outside the conservatory. Mary, trying to leave the house at
   3 am for a reason she declines to explain, finds Denver kneeling over
   Cathcart's body. Suspicion falls on Denver, as the lethal bullet had
   come from his revolver and he admits having quarrelled with Cathcart
   earlier, after receiving a letter (which he says has been lost)
   informing him that Cathcart had been caught cheating at cards. He
   maintains that he stumbled across the body after returning from a walk
   on the moors, but will say no more.

   Wimsey arrives to investigate, along with his friend Inspector Charles
   Parker, who will find himself becoming increasingly attracted to Lady
   Mary throughout the novel. They find a series of unidentified
   footprints and a discarded jewel in the form of a cat. It is clear that
   both Denver and Mary are hiding something: Denver refuses to budge from
   his story that he was simply out for a walk, while Mary is feigning
   illness to avoid talking to anyone.

   Wimsey investigates several false leads. The footprints turn out to be
   those of Mary's secret true fiance, Goyles, a socialist agitator
   considered 'an unsuitable match' by her family. He had crept into the
   grounds for a pre-arranged rendezvous at 3 am, when the couple had
   intended to elope. Mary assumed that he was the killer and has been
   covering for him, but when she learns that he had fled in terror after
   discovering the body, she breaks off their engagement in disgust at his
   cowardice.

   Wimsey's investigations lead him to a violent local farmer,
   Grimethorpe, with a stunningly beautiful wife. Wimsey finds the lost
   letter that was sent to Denver wedged in the window of the
   Grimethorpes' bedroom, proving that Denver had been visiting Mrs
   Grimethorpe on the night of Cathcart's death. This is what he has
   refused to admit, being determined to shield his mistress even at the
   price of being wrongfully convicted of murder.

   Eventually, the jewelled cat leads Wimsey to Cathcart's mistress of
   many years, who had left him for an American millionaire. Wimsey
   travels to New York to find her, makes a daring and dangerous
   transatlantic flight back to London, and arrives just in time to
   present his evidence at Denver's trial in the House of Lords. Wimsey
   brings a letter that Cathcart had written to his mistress on the night
   of his death. After hearing that she was leaving him, Cathcart had
   written back stating his intention to commit suicide. He had then taken
   Denver's revolver from the study and gone out into the garden to shoot
   himself. The confounding factor in the investigation had been the
   coincidence of Denver returning from Mrs Grimethorpe's, just in time to
   find the body, at the same time that Mary had emerged from the house
   for her rendezvous with Goyles.

   Denver is acquitted. As he is leaving the House of Lords, Grimethorpe
   appears, shoots at him, flees, and is knocked down and killed by a
   passing taxi. Mrs Grimethorpe, finally free of her husband, declares
   that she has no interest in continuing her affair with Denver. In the
   final scene of the book, Inspector Sugg finds Wimsey, Parker, and a
   friend on the street after midnight, hopelessly drunk, celebrating the
   end of the case. Sugg assists them into cabs, and reflects, "Thank Gawd
   there weren't no witnesses".
