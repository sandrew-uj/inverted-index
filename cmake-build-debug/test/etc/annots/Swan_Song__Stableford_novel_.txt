   The series is the story of star pilot Grainger, who is forced by
   circumstances, after his own ship is destroyed in a disastrous crash,
   to accept a job flying a new ship, the Hooded Swan, that is a fusion of
   human and alien technologies. She is faster and more manoeuvrable than
   any previous design, but despite the opportunity offered, Grainger
   resents the fact he is employed simply as a pilot but denied the
   position of captain, and cannot resign at any time during his two-year
   contract without dire financial penalties that he regards as thoroughly
   unjust. In fact Grainger regards his terms of employment as making him
   little more than a slave, or at least an indentured servant. However,
   left little alternative by his financial situation, Grainger takes the
   job, and carries out a variety of assignments for his new masters,
   accompanied by the unwelcome alien symbiote sharing his brain.
