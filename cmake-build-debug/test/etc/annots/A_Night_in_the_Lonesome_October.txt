   A Night in the Lonesome October is narrated from the point-of-view of
   Snuff, a dog who is Jack the Ripper's companion. The bulk of the story
   takes place in London and its environs, though at one point the story
   detours through the dream-world described by Lovecraft in The
   Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath. Though never explicitly stated, various
   contextual clues within the story (the most obvious of which being the
   appearance of Sherlock Holmes or "The Great Detective") imply that it
   takes place during the late Victorian period.

   The story reveals that once every few decades when the moon is full on
   the night of Halloween, the fabric of reality thins and doors may be
   opened between this world and the realm of the Great Old Ones. When
   these conditions are right, men and women with occult knowledge may
   gather at a specific ritual site to hold the doors closed, or to help
   fling them open. Should the Closers win, then the world will remain as
   it is until the next turning... but should the Openers succeed, then
   the Great Old Ones will come to Earth, to remake the world in their own
   image (enslaving or slaughtering the human race in the process). The
   Openers have never yet won. These meetings are often referred to as
   "The Game" or "The Great Game" by the participants, who try to keep the
   goings-on secret from the mundane population.

   The various "Players" during the Game depicted in the book are
   archetypal characters from Victorian Era gothic fiction - Jack the
   Ripper (only ever referred to as "Jack"), Dracula ("The Count"), Victor
   Frankenstein ("The Good Doctor"), and the Wolf Man (known as "Larry
   Talbot", the film character's name) all make appearances. In addition,
   there is a Witch ("Crazy Jill"), a Clergyman (Vicar Roberts), a Druid
   ("Owen"), a "Mad Monk" ("Rastov" - apparently modeled after Rasputin),
   and Hermetic occultists ("Morris and McCab" - often mentioned as a
   reference to a real hermetic of the time, MacGregor Mathers).^[citation

   Each Player has a familiar - an animal companion with near-human
   intelligence that helps complete the numerous preparations for the
   ritual. The majority of the story describes the interactions and
   discussions of these familiars, all from Snuff's point of view.

   Throughout the book, the Players slowly take sides, form alliances,
   make deals, oppose one another, and even kill off their enemies. The
   plot accelerates until the night of October 31, when the rite takes
   place and the fate of the world is decided.
