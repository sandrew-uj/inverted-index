   Marquis d'Urfe, a young French diplomat, finds himself in a small
   Serbian village, in the house of an old peasant named Gorcha. The host
   is absent: he left the house ten days ago along with some other men to
   hunt for a Turk outlaw Alibek. Upon leaving he told his sons,
   Georges and Pierre, that they should wait for him for
   ten days sharp and, should he come a minute later, kill him by driving
   a stake through his heart for then he'd be not a man but a vourdalak
   (vampire).

   The day Marquis comes to the village is the tenth day of Gorcha's
   absence. The family awaits the hour with growing anxiety and there he
   is, appearing on the road at 8 o'clock in the evening, exactly on the
   time he left ten days ago. His sons are uncertain as to how this
   strange precision should be interpreted. Georges suspects his father
   became a vourdalak, Pierre insists otherwise. Then Georges' son dies
   inexplicably. The French diplomat has to leave the house and continue
   his travel.

   Half a year later on his way back from his mission, d'Urfe returns to
   the village only to find it abandoned. Coming to the familiar house he
   stays for the night, being allured by Sdenka, Gorcha's
   daughter he fell for during his first visit, who appears to dwell in
   the empty house. The moment comes when the Frenchman realizes he's
   fallen under the charms of a vampire. He makes an attempt to leave,
   comes under a massive attack of vourdalaks, all of the Gorcha family
   among them, and makes a miraculous escape, having to thank his own good
   luck and the agility of his horse.
