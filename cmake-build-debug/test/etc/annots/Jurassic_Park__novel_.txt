   In 1989, a series of strange animal attacks occur in Costa Rica,
   including a worker severely injured on a mysterious construction
   project on the nearby island of Isla Nublar.^[a] One of the species
   behind the attacks is identified as a Procompsognathus. Paleontologist
   Alan Grant and his paleobotanist graduate student Ellie Sattler are
   contacted to confirm the identification, but are abruptly whisked away
   by billionaire John Hammond--founder and chief executive officer of
   International Genetic Technologies, or InGen--for a weekend visit to a
   "biological preserve" he has established on Isla Nublar.

   The preserve is revealed to be Jurassic Park, a theme park showcasing
   cloned dinosaurs. The animals have been recreated using damaged
   dinosaur DNA found in blood inside of gnats, ticks, and mosquitoes
   fossilized and preserved in amber. Gaps in the genetic code have been
   filled in with "compatible" reptilian, avian, or amphibian DNA. To
   control the population, all specimens on the island are
   lysine-deficient and X-Ray sterilized females.
   Ian Malcolm created dragon curves to simulate the actions that were to
   take place in the park.

   Recent incidents in the park have spooked Hammond's investors. To
   placate them, Hammond uses Grant and Sattler as fresh consultants. They
   stand in counterbalance to a famous mathematician and chaos theorist
   Ian Malcolm, and a lawyer representing the investors, Donald Gennaro,
   who are pessimistic about the park's prospects. Malcolm, having been
   consulted before the park's creation, is especially emphatic in his
   prediction that the park will collapse, as it is an unsustainable
   simple structure bluntly forced upon a complex system with too many
   unpredictable variables. Hammond also brings along his grandchildren,
   Tim and Alexis 'Lex' Murphy, who join the tour group. The park's staff
   include engineer John Arnold, biotechnologist Henry Wu, game warden
   Robert Muldoon, public relations manager Ed Regis and veterinarian
   Gerry Harding. While touring the park, Grant finds a Velociraptor
   eggshell, seemingly proving Malcolm's earlier assertion that the
   dinosaurs have somehow been breeding against the geneticists' design.

   Meanwhile, the disgruntled chief programmer of Jurassic Park's
   controlling software, Dennis Nedry, attempts corporate espionage for
   Lewis Dodgson, a geneticist and agent of InGen's archrival, Biosyn. By
   activating a backdoor he wrote into the park's computer system, Nedry
   shuts down its security systems and steals frozen embryos for each of
   the park's fifteen species in an attempt to smuggle them out of the
   park. However, during Nedry's escape he loses his bearings due to a
   sudden tropical storm, and is killed by a Dilophosaurus. Without Nedry
   to reactivate the park's security, the electrified fences remain off
   and all the dinosaurs escape. The park's adult Tyrannosaurus attacks
   the guests on tour, with a juvenile T. rex killing Regis. In the
   aftermath, Grant and the children become lost in the park. Malcolm is
   gravely injured during the incident, but is found by Gennaro and
   Muldoon, and spends the remainder of the novel slowly dying as--between
   lucid lectures and morphine-induced rants--he tries to help the others
   understand their predicament and survive.

   The park's staff manage to temporarily get the park largely back in
   order, restoring the computer system by shutting down and restarting
   the power. When trying to restore the park to working order, they fail
   to notice that the system has been running on auxiliary power since the
   restart; this power soon runs out, shutting the park down a second
   time. The park's intelligent and aggressive Velociraptors escape their
   enclosure, and kill Arnold and Wu. Meanwhile, Grant and the children
   slowly make their way back to the Visitor Center by rafting down the
   jungle river, carrying news that several young raptors were on board
   the island's supply ship when it departed for the mainland. After the
   three return to the visitor's center, they are contacted by the others,
   who instruct Grant to switch on the park's generators. Tim is then able
   to reactivate the park's main power, allowing Gennaro to force the
   supply ship to return.

   Grant, Sattler, Muldoon, and Gennaro find the wild raptor nests and
   compare hatched eggs with the island's revised population tally,
   realizing the animals are leaving the island in an attempt at
   migration. Meanwhile, Hammond, taking a walk and contemplating building
   a new park improving on his previous mistakes, hears a T. rex roar and,
   startled, falls down a hill, where he is eaten by a pack of
   Procompsognathus. Grant deduces that using frog DNA to fill gaps in the
   dinosaurs' genetic code enabled a measure of dichogamy, in which some
   of the female animals changed into males in response to the same-sex
   environment. The computer tally failed to include newborn animals,
   having been programmed to stop counting once the assumed correct total
   number of animals had been found.

   The survivors are rescued by the Costa Rican Air Force, which declare
   the island hazardous and unsafe, and proceed to raze the island with
   napalm. Survivors of the incident are indefinitely detained by the
   United States and Costa Rican governments at a hotel. Weeks later,
   Grant is visited by Dr. Martin Guitierrez, an American doctor who lives
   in Costa Rica. Guitierrez informs Grant that an unknown pack of animals
   has been migrating through the Costa Rican jungle, eating lysine-rich
   crops and chickens, indicating the dinosaurs may still exist in the
   wild.
