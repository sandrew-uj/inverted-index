   On the colony planet of Harlan's World, Takeshi Kovacs and his partner
   Sarah Sachilowski, former Envoys who had returned to a life of crime,
   are killed by a U.N. colonial commando unit. Kovacs is sentenced to a
   long term in stack storage. On Earth, a Meth named Laurens Bancroft has
   died in mysterious circumstances in Bay City (formerly San Francisco).
   The re-sleeved Bancroft has no memories of the previous two days,
   including his own death. Though police officer Kristin Ortega believes
   he committed suicide, Bancroft is convinced he was murdered. He hires
   Kovacs to investigate. Kovacs discovers that Bancroft has been involved
   with numerous prostitutes, including recent murder victim Elizabeth
   Elliot. Elizabeth's mother Irene was imprisoned for illegally hacking
   Bancroft's memories. Elizabeth's father is too poor to re-sleeve
   Elizabeth or to free his wife from the stacks.

   Laurens' wife, Miriam, seduces Kovacs and bribes him to end the
   investigation. A high-level Russian operative named Kadmin tries to
   assassinate Kovacs, but fails and is captured. Kovacs investigates the
   brothel where Elizabeth worked. He learns he is wearing the sleeve of
   Elias Ryker, a corrupt police officer and Ortega's lover. He is
   tortured by physicians from the Wei Clinic, who deal in black market
   sleeve theft. He tells his interrogators that he is an Envoy and they
   release him. A mysterious woman named Trepp says she will bring Kovacs
   to Ray, who is behind the clinic's operations. Kovacs escapes, destroys
   the brothel and clinic, and murders the employees in the process.

   Kovacs and Ortega are injured in an explosion orchestrated by Kadmin,
   who has escaped police custody. Trepp brings Kovacs to "Ray", or
   Reileen Kawahara. Kawahara is a Meth mob boss with whom Kovacs has
   dealt in the past. He had rejected her offers of partnership, believing
   her to be cruel and manipulative. Kawahara orders Kovacs to end his
   investigation, or she will torture Sarah, who is currently in virtual
   storage.

   Kovacs and Ortega begin sleeping together and form a partnership.
   Kovacs agrees to convince Bancroft he committed suicide. His version of
   the story is as follows. Bancroft contracted the Rawlings virus from a
   brothel. The Rawlings virus is designed to scramble cortical stacks and
   prevent re-sleeving, causing permanent death. To prevent it from
   contaminating his clones, Bancroft committed suicide. Kawahara agreed
   to procure a copy of the virus for Kovacs. With Kawahara's help, he
   retrieves Irene Elliot from stack, and hires her to implant the
   Rawlings virus into a brothel.

   Kovacs learns that Bancroft went to an airship-turned-brothel named
   Head in the Clouds on the night he died. This establishment is run by
   Kawahara. Kadmin kidnaps Ortega and threatens to kill her unless Kovacs
   trades himself for her. Ortega is released, and Kovacs is forced to
   fight in a duel against Kadmin. Trepp and the police arrive, killing
   Kadmin. Kovacs destroys Kadmin's stack.

   Kovacs double-sleeves, controlling both Ryker and a second body
   simultaneously. The copy in Ryker's sleeve leaves with Miriam to draw
   away surveillance. Ortega and Kovacs infiltrate Head in the Clouds.
   Irene spikes Kawahara's personality backup with the Rawlings virus,
   destroying all of her clones. Kovacs forces a confession from Kawahara.
   After a Catholic prostitute was murdered at Head in the Clouds, her
   resurrection would have revealed Kawahara's illegal activity. As part
   of her cover-up, Kawahara framed Ryker for corruption, since he was
   investigating the murder. She asked Bancroft to help her kill
   Resolution 653 to prevent the prostitute from testifying, but he
   refused. Kawahara and Miriam had Bancroft drugged; out of his mind, he
   killed a prostitute and then killed himself in order to erase the
   memory out of guilt and self-preservation. With his memories gone,
   Kawahara's involvement could not be traced.

   Assisted by Trepp, Kovacs blows out the side of the airship. As he
   falls to the ocean below, he uses a grenade to destroy Kawahara's
   stack, ensuring her permanent death.

   In the aftermath, Bancroft is cleared by the U.N. for his involvement
   with Kawahara. The copy of Kovacs that stayed with Miriam is erased, as
   double sleeving is illegal, but he makes the surviving copy of Kovacs
   promise to cover up Miriam's involvement. Irene Elliot gets her body
   back, Elizabeth and Ryker are freed from the stacks, Resolution 653
   passes, and Kovacs is freed and returned to Harlan's World.
