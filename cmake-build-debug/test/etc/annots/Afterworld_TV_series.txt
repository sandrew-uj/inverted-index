   After travelling to New York City on a business trip, Russell Shoemaker
   wakes to find all electronic technology dead and more than 99% of the
   human race missing. Driven by a need to discover the truth and
   determined to return to his family, he embarks on a journey to his home
   in Seattle, while recording and telling all of the events in his
   journal. Afterworld is the story of Russell's 3,000-mile (4,800 km)
   trek across a post-apocalyptic America as he encounters the strange new
   societies rebuilding themselves. Along the way, he also attempts to
   solve the mystery of what caused this global event, which survivors
   refer to as "the Fall."

   In addition to new forms of government, Russell discovers that
   technology has failed due to a persistent electromagnetic pulse, a
   product of a collection of satellites that was activated almost
   simultaneously to the Fall. An additional side effect of the EMP is the
   rapid mutation of many forms of life, including Shoemaker himself. He
   describes that his night vision has improved dramatically, along with
   his endurance. Other examples are seen in cattle Russell happens
   across, which are dying of a previously unheard form of necrotizing
   fasciitis.

   Russell's journey eventually brings him to a nearly deserted San
   Francisco, and the headquarters of an organization known as the Parthia
   Group, who had developed a form of nano-technology, which identified
   humans with a particular genetic makeup.
