   Meg Elginbrodde, a young war widow whose husband was presumed killed
   during the D-Day landings, has been receiving mysterious photographs
   that suggest he is still alive. As a thick and overwhelming pea soup
   fog begins to descend upon London, she meets with Inspector Charle Luke
   and her cousin, the detective Albert Campion, at a train station to
   await the arrival of an individual who claims to know her husband's
   whereabouts. Meg appears to recognise a man disembarking from a train
   as her husband, but when apprehended the man is revealed to be a
   recently paroled convict called "Duds" Morrison who has somehow
   acquired an old, distinctive coat of Elginbrodde's. Duds is arrested
   but soon released without charge.

   Unknown to the others, Meg's new fiancee Geoffrey Levitt, who is driven
   to jealousy by the uncertainty of knowing whether Elginbrodde is
   actually alive, accosts Duds after his release and tries to bribe him
   for information regarding Elginbrodde. Before he can learn anything,
   the two men are attacked by a gang of criminals disguised as a street
   band made up of beggars and impoverished veterans. The gang demand that
   Duds reveal the whereabouts of Duds's employer, a man they refer to
   only as "the Gaffer", who they claim has cheated them out of something
   valuable. When Duds tries to flee, the gang attack him, resulting in
   the gang leader, the albino Tiddy Doll, accidentally kicking him to
   death. The gang kidnap Geoffrey and, disguising him as a fellow beggar,
   hold him hostage.

   Investigating how Duds acquired the coat, Meg's father Canon Avril
   discovers that a member of his household staff gave it to Mrs Lucy
   Cash, a local loan shark, to settle a debt. Levitt's unusual
   disappearance begins to arouse suspicion that he is involved in the
   murder of Duds. However, during the investigation three people,
   including a young police detective, are brutally stabbed to death in a
   nearby house, triggering a public outcry. The murderer is quickly
   identified as Jack Havoc, a violent and mysterious convict who has
   recently escaped from jail. Learning that Havoc served with Elginbrodde
   during the war, it soon becomes clear to Campion and Luke that Havoc is
   "the Gaffer". Meg, accompanied by Campion's wife Amanda, goes to her
   and Levitt's future home to destroy wartime letters she received from
   Elginbrodde in an attempt to find closure. However, while they are
   there Havoc breaks in and begins to ransack the house, clearly
   searching for something. Meg flees to seek help while Amanda stays to
   observe Havoc. Before Havoc can discover her, the house is stormed by
   the police, but Havoc manages a lucky escape.

   While the gang are debating what to do with Geoffrey Levitt,
   Havoc--their wartime sergeant--surprises them by entering their
   hideout. Although Havoc still holds a powerful thrall over the gang,
   Tiddy Doll realises that he actually needs the gang's help, having
   earned the wrath of both the police and the criminal underworld due to
   his reckless actions. Havoc reveals that, during a confidential mission
   in occupied France during the war, Elginbrodde revealed that the house
   the unit was infiltrating was his family home, and that a great
   treasure had been located there. In the event of his death, the
   treasure would be inherited by Meg. Elginbrodde had written a letter
   revealing the treasure's exact location, and the impersonation was an
   attempt to acquire it from her. The connections between himself and
   Elginbrodde have convinced Havoc of the existence of what he calls "the
   Science of Luck" and his all-consuming belief that he is destined to
   find the treasure has driven all his ruthless actions.

   Tiddy Doll, who is paranoid that Levitt can identify him as the
   murderer of Duds, attempts to manipulate Havoc into revealing too much
   in front of Levitt, which would give him reason to murder the other
   man. Before this can happen, however, Campion--following a hunch--comes
   across their hideout, forcing the gang to make a swift retreat and
   leave Geoffrey behind to be rescued. Using information provided by
   Havoc, Geoffrey locates the letter and decides to find the treasure to
   protect Meg's inheritance. Campion, Amanda and Meg agree to accompany
   him to Elginbrodde's childhood home in France to search for it.

   After a conversation with Inspector Luke, who suspects a connection
   between Havoc and Mrs Cash, Canon Avril realises that Havoc's true
   identity is Johnny Cash, the son of Mrs Cash who had previously been
   thought dead. In fact, Mrs Cash had blackmailed Avril's now-deceased
   wife, who was in debt to her, to pretend to identify her son's body to
   help him avoid punishment for his crimes. Avril goes to confront Havoc,
   whom he realizes has been secretly hiding in the crypt of the local
   church. They are old acquaintances, if not friends, and during their
   confrontation, the two also have a philosophical conversation about
   Havoc's belief in the "Science of Luck", which shares some similarity
   to Avril's own philosophy of life. After accidentally revealing the
   location of the treasure, Avril tries to persuade Havoc to abandon his
   murderous path. Havoc attacks Avril in response--but the old priest's
   words have shaken his self-confidence, leading Havoc to untypically
   only wound Avril instead of murdering him.

   Driven to desperation, Havoc follows Campion and the others to France
   and the now-known location of the treasure, closely pursued by
   Inspector Luke. On arriving, Havoc narrowly escapes a violent ambush
   which sees the rest of the gang, including Tiddy Doll, killed or
   arrested. On reaching the statue where the treasure is hidden, Havoc
   encounters Meg, whom he used to bully when they were children. Alone,
   and not recognising her childhood acquaintance, Meg asks for his help
   in removing the treasure from the statue, which the two manage to
   accomplish. The treasure turns out to be a beautiful but monetarily
   worthless old ivory carving of a Madonna and Child. Meg, finally
   reaching closure with Elginbrodde's death, is moved to tears, but Havoc
   is horrified that all he has done has been for nothing. A broken man,
   he escapes the clutches of the police one more time, after which he
   commits suicide by plunging off a nearby cliff.
