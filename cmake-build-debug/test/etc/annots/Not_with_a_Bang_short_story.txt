   The story is an ironic, Adam-and-Eve tale. Humanity has been wiped out
   by a nuclear war, except for one man and woman, who meet in a
   restaurant in Salt Lake City. The man suffers from a disease that
   causes recurrent episodes of total paralysis. While in the bathroom, he
   has an attack, and dies with the realization that the woman is too
   prudish to enter and save him.
