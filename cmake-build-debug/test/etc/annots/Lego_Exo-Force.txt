   The story of Exo-Force portrays brave young pilots who use battle
   machines and teamwork to overcome overwhelming odds in their war
   against an army of evil robots.

   On Sentai Mountain, there was a peaceful civilization where advanced
   robots and the ancient way of life went hand in hand. But one day, a
   golden robot named Meca One led the robots to revolt against the
   humans. Fights between the humans and robots broke out, unleashing
   uncontrollable energies that divided the mountain in two. The humans
   eventually overcame the robots, and cast them into the gorge.

   The humans built bridges to link the two halves of the mountain. The
   most important bridge they built was the Tenchi ( "heaven & earth")
   Bridge. Some humans, including Sensei Keiken, feared that the robots
   might come back someday so Sensei Keiken promptly began to construct
   armored battle machines for defense. But before the humans'
   preparations were complete, the robot legions, armed with battle
   machines of their own, caught the humans by surprise and quickly seized
   control of the southern half of the mountain. More powerful than ever,
   their primary aim was this: to completely drive humanity from Sentai
   Mountain. Sensei Keiken hurriedly recruited new pilots to man the
   battle machines and Exo-Force was born.

   The Exo-Force storyline for 2006 culminated in the Battle of Sentai
   Fortress when Meca One unleashed an all-out assault on the humans.
   After a narrow victory, Keiken decided that Exo-Force was too
   vulnerable in the Sentai Fortress and that they needed an "edge" to
   defeat the robots.

   The 2007 storyline centers around Exo-Force's discovery of the
   legendary Golden City at the top of Sentai Mountain and mysterious
   secret codes therein which could be used to unlock powerful technology.
   Keiken's hope was that this technology would provide the crucial key to
   defeating the robots.

   In the 2008 storyline, the northern side of the mountain began to be
   conquered by the robots and many Exo-Force pilots were held captive.
   Among the lot, Sensei Keiken was captured, and is being held captive by
   the robots in the jungle at the base of Sentai Mountain. The remaining
   Exo-Force pilots must rescue their leader in this hostile jungle
   environment that holds the secret to what gave the robots life and the
   will to destroy. This plot was not resolved and the theme was
   discontinued after a single online comic.
