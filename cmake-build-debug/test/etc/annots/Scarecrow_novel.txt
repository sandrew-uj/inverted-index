   Majestic-12, a group of the world's richest men, make up a bounty list
   of fifteen targets that have to be eliminated before 12 noon of October
   26. Among the targets is Shane Schofield, who at that moment is on a
   mission in Siberia with Book II and a group of U.S. Marines.
   Schofield's team is supposed to meet up with two Delta groups, the
   leaders of which are also on M-12's hit list. Schofield's unit comes
   under fire from a group of bounty hunters led by Cedric Wexley and all
   but Schofield and Book II are killed. Schofield and Book II escape via
   a hijacked plane owned by a bounty hunter known as the Hungarian.

   Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, Schofield's girlfriend Elizabeth Gant leads
   a group of Marines, along with Mother, to a cave system where Osama bin
   Laden's number two man is. Schofield races to Afghanistan to find Gant
   so that none of the bounty hunters can use her to get to him, but
   arrives too late to save her and she gets captured by a bounty hunter
   group known as IG-88, led by Damon "Demon" Larkham. Schofield meets a
   bounty hunter named Aloysius Knight who has been paid to protect him
   and teams up with him. Knight and Schofield go to save Gant while Book
   II and Mother go to London to confront another person on the hit list.

   Meanwhile, the other people on the hit list are being taken out.
   Schofield's friend David Fairfax goes to help one of them but the man
   he is going to help is killed, as is the person Book II and Mother are
   attempting to meet. Schofield, Knight, and Gant disguise themselves as
   bounty hunters to get into a castle owned by Jonathan Killian, one of
   the men in Majestic-12, to find out more about the bounty hunt. While
   Knight claims the bounty on two heads, Killian sets a trap for
   Schofield and Gant, forcing them to escape in one of Killian's cars
   with Wexley's men in hot pursuit, followed by Knight in his Sukhoi .
   Schofield goes over a cliff and is presumed dead while Knight and Gant
   are captured.

   Mother is picked up by Rufus, Knight's pilot, and goes to help Knight
   while Schofield is captured by French soldiers and brought to an
   aircraft carrier to explain to him why he is to be terminated. At
   Killian's castle, Gant is brutally murdered on a guillotine. However,
   Knight escapes, Gant's final words being for Knight to tell Schofield
   she would have said yes to his planned proposal. Rufus, Mother, and
   Knight go to rescue Schofield.

   On the French aircraft carrier, it is revealed that Schofield, along
   with the fifteen other targets, are the only people who have quick
   enough reactions to disable the missiles being launched from disguised
   ships in the Kormoran Project. The plan involves copies of different
   countries' missiles being launched at their bitterest enemies,
   resulting in a new Cold War which will bring in huge profits for the
   members of Majestic-12. Schofield is rescued by Knight, but then Knight
   reveals to him that Gant was decapitated.

   Saddened by Gant's death, Schofield attempts to commit suicide but is
   stopped by Mother. in the meantime, the President of the United States
   gives all of the U.S. Armed Forces' resources to Schofield to
   neutralize the threat posed by the ships. He then directs certain ships
   to be sunk using torpedoes. At the same time, Fairfax and Book II are
   flown to different ships so that Schofield can disable all of the
   missiles at the same time. Schofield succeeds in disabling the
   missiles, but Mother is presumed to have perished. Schofield later
   learns that there is a backup plan and a missile is heading right for
   Mecca on the first day of Ramadan. Schofield is able to deactivate the
   missile but in turn, M-12 captures Schofield, Rufus, and Knight.

   Schofield is about to be killed in the same way and by the same person
   as Gant was but Mother reveals herself to be alive and Schofield kills
   Gant's killer while Rufus is injured. Knight and Schofield go to
   confront Killian and Wexley is killed too. Schofield throws himself and
   Killian out of a window in a suicide attempt, but Knight saves
   Schofield.

   Several months later, Knight and Rufus meet the person who hired them,
   Lillian Mattencourt, the richest woman on the planet, who ruined M-12s
   plan because they would not let her be part of the group as she was a
   woman. It is also revealed that the rest of M-12 died in mysterious
   ways. Demon and the IG-88 kill Knight's payer as revenge for taking two
   of their bounties during the hunt. Later, at Mother's house, Schofield
   receives a letter from Knight telling him to accept Gant's death and
   move on. Schofield then goes to the Marine Corps building and says he's
   ready for duty again.
