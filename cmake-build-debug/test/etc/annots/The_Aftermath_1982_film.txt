   Three astronauts return to Earth after a nuclear holocaust (that also
   saw biological weapons used), although one dies in a crash landing. The
   two survivors, Newman (Steve Barkett) and Matthews, encounter some
   mutants before discovering that Los Angeles has been completely
   destroyed. Seeking shelter, the men take refuge in an abandoned
   mansion. Newman later encounters a young boy, Chris, hiding in a museum
   with the curator (Forrest J Ackerman).

   Before the curator passes away from radiation poisoning, Newman takes
   Chris under his care. While out seeking supplies one day, Newman and
   Chris encounter Sarah, who is running from a gang of bandits led by
   Cutter (Sid Haig).

   After Sarah's murder, Newman decides to confront the gang at their
   desert wasteland hideout. After killing Cutter's gang, Newman is
   fatally wounded by the gang leader, who in turn is shot dead by Chris
   with a revolver. The boy then walks off alone before the credits roll.
