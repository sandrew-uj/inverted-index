   Six weeks after returning from the Jovian system, David "Lucky" Starr
   learns that Jack Dorrance, the chief of a Sirian spy ring uncovered by
   Starr in the Jovian system, has escaped from Earth.

   Starr and his sidekick Bigman Jones follow Dorrance to the Saturnian
   system, where Dorrance tries to lose them in Saturn's rings, but his
   ship is destroyed by a ring fragment. A Sirian ship then contacts Starr
   and informs him that the Sirians have built a colony on Titan and
   claimed it for Sirius, contrary to the traditional principle that
   inhabitants of one world in a stellar system have sovereignty over the
   entire system, even those parts without permanent settlements. Starr
   orders the pursuing Terrestrial fleet back to Earth; but returns with
   Bigman and Councilman Ben Wessilewsky to the Saturnian system.

   When several Sirian ships pursue the Shooting Starr, Starr conceals
   himself and his ship in the interior of Mimas; leaves Wessilewsky below
   the surface with enough supplies to maintain himself for several
   months; then takes the Shooting Starr back into space, where they are
   captured by the Sirians and taken to the colony on Titan. There, Sirian
   commander Sten Devoure threatens to have Bigman killed unless Starr
   agrees to testify at an upcoming interstellar conference on the
   asteroid Vesta that he entered the Saturnian system to attack the
   Sirians. When Bigman endangers himself by defeating Devoure in a duel,
   Starr makes a deal with Devoure: if he spares Bigman's life, Starr will
   testify that he entered the Saturnian system in an armed ship, and will
   lead the Sirians to Wessilewsky's base on Mimas.

   As delegates assemble for the conference, Agas Doremo, the leader of
   the neutralist forces of the Galaxy, tells Conway they should let the
   Sirians stay. While he supports the idea of stellar systems being
   indivisible, Doremo cannot see a way to get the Sirians out of the
   Solar System without a war, given the other worlds' distrust of Earth.
   However, should the Sirians remain, they might eventually overplay
   their hand, allowing for a new conference under more favorable
   conditions. However, he agrees to do what he can to support Earth's
   view should the opportunity arise.

   Doremo is elected to preside over the conference; the one thing both
   sides agree upon. Devoure admits that the Sirians have established a
   base on Titan, but insists that the fact that Saturn and its moons are
   part of Earth's stellar system is irrelevant: "An empty world is an
   empty world, regardless of the particular route it travels through
   space. We colonized it first and it is ours". Devoure then brings out
   Starr, who admits to having re-entered the Saturnian system after being
   warned off, and also that Wessilewsky established a base on Mimas.
   Conway then receives permission to cross-examine Starr.

   When asked his reasons, according to a secret plan of his own, Starr
   replies that Wessilewsky was placed to establish a colony on Mimas. At
   this, Conway states that by removing Wessilewsky from Mimas, the
   Sirians violated the very principle they attempted to establish -
   Devoure has stated earlier that the Sirians have never even approached
   Mimas earlier, so it is Earth's regardless of whose point of view is
   taken. Seeing the opportunity, Doremo points out the demonstrated
   implications of accepting the Sirian view; a war can start literally
   over every single rock. Then he manipulates the delegates into a vote
   before Sirius can work out a proper response. The conference ends with
   three client worlds voting with the Sirians, and the rest voting with
   Earth, with the result that the Sirians are ordered to leave Titan
   within a month - the principle of "Indivisibility of Stellar Systems"
   being firmly established, which the protagonists consider a positive
   and desirable outcome.
