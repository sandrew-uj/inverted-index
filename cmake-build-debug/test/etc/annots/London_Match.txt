   Samson suspects that there is a traitor within his department of MI6,
   due to the appearance of a memorandum which was leaked to the KGB. It
   transpires that it is part of a plot conducted by his wife--now working
   for East German intelligence--to frame his superior, Bret Rensselaer,
   as a KGB agent. When Samson's old friend Werner Volkmann is arrested by
   the East German police Samson organizes an unauthorised exchange of
   defector Erich Stinnes for him, but the operation ends in a shootout on
   the Berlin S-Bahn.
