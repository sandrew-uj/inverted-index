   Scub Coral
          Eureka Seven takes place in the year 12005 and it has been
          10,000 years after humanity has made a mass exodus into space,
          due to the arrival of the Scub Coral (SuKaBu.6Ko-6RaRu, Sukabu
          Koraru), an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the
          planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current
          timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown
          planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of
          Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now
          covered by a rock-like surface formed by the Scub Coral. The
          Scub Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The
          theory that the Scub Coral is an intelligent life form was
          proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the
          Scub is looking for mutual co-existence with humanity. All
          theories and information about the Scub Coral being a sentient
          being are kept from the general population. In addition to being
          the surface of the planet, the Scub Coral has several physical
          manifestations, called Coralians (Ko-6RaRiA6N6, Korarian), that
          are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are
          either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans.
          The manifestations are:

   Command Cluster Coralian
          The Command Cluster is a large concentration of the Scub Coral
          which acts as the central mind for the rest of its "body". It
          stores all the information the Scub has collected over the last
          10,000 years, and keeps the rest of the Scub Coral in a dormant
          state.

   Kute-class Coralian
          A Kute-class is massive sphere of concentrated energy that
          materializes suddenly in the skies. Though it is a rare natural
          occurrence, they can be artificially triggered by causing heavy
          damage to the Scub Coral. The disappearance of a Kute causes a
          massive release of energy, ravaging the surrounding landscape
          and lowering the Trapar count in the area to almost non-existent
          levels.

   Antibody Coralians
          Antibody Coralians are, as the name suggests, creatures created
          by the Scub Coral to destroy anything nearby that might be
          causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a
          Kute-class Coralian when the Scub Coral is threatened or
          attacked. These antibodies can range in size from as small as a
          wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary
          wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering
          flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures
          they absorbed when they just started their 'growth'. Their
          powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus
          being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's
          body and imploding it (unconfirmed), and creating a spherical
          void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish.
          Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate
          attacks on the Scub Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20
          minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven
          Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they
          crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic
          invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of
          each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3: The Final and
          Super Robot Wars Z.

   Human-form Coralians
          Human-form Coralians are beings created by the Scub Coral in the
          form of humans. They are regarded by scientists as emissaries of
          the Scub Coral, sent to learn about humanity. Humans have
          attempted to create their own artificial human-form Coralians,
          but the results are often less than satisfactory. As shown with
          Eureka in the sequel series, human-form Coralians are
          biologically capable of reproducing the same way as humans do;
          she gave birth to a daughter and son. However, due to her
          children being Human-Coralian hybrids, the high level of Trapar
          would be too dangerous for them.

   Trapar waves and lifting
          In Eureka Seven, as a result of the Scub Coral covering the
          planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known
          as Transparence Light Particles
          (ToRaN6SaPaRaN6Su.6RaI6To.6Pa-6Tei6KuRu, Toransaparansu Raito
          Patikuru), dubbed Trapar (ToRaPa-6, Torapa) waves for short.
          Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with
          it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the
          Scub Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most
          important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of
          propulsion for flight-capable vehicles.
          Though Trapar-propelled airships are relatively common, using
          Trapar waves for "lifting" (RiHuTei6N6Gu, Rifutingu, or
          "reffing", according to some fan translations, as well as
          official translations in some countries) is their predominant
          use. Lifting uses surfboard-like devices called "reflection
          boards" ("ref boards" (RiHuBo-6Do, Rifubodo) for short) to ride
          Trapar waves in a manner similar to surfing, and is a popular
          sport in the series. The most grandiose use of Trapar--massive
          humanoid fightercraft--are a recent development, made possible
          by the discovery of bizarre alien life-forms within the Scub
          Coral.
