   The Hunger Games is a series of young adult dystopian novels written by
   the American author Suzanne Collins. The series is set in the Hunger
   Games universe, with the first three novels being a trilogy following
   teenage protagonist Katniss Everdeen.

   The novels in the trilogy are titled The Hunger Games (2008), Catching
   Fire (2009), and Mockingjay (2010). Each was adapted for film,
   establishing The Hunger Games film series, with the film adaptation of
   Mockingjay split into two feature-length motion pictures. The first two
   books in the series were both New York Times best sellers, and
   Mockingjay topped all US bestseller lists upon its release.^[1]^[2] By
   the time the film adaptation of The Hunger Games was released in 2012,
   the publisher had reported over 26 million Hunger Games trilogy books
   in print, including movie tie-in books.^[3]

   The Hunger Games universe is a dystopia set in Panem, a North American
   country consisting of the wealthy Capitol and 13 districts in varying
   states of poverty. Every year, children from the first 12 districts are
   selected via lottery to participate in a compulsory televised battle
   royale death match called The Hunger Games.

   The novels were all well received. In August 2012, the series ranked
   second, exceeded only by the Harry Potter series in NPR's poll of the
   top 100 teen novels, which asked voters to choose their favorite young
   adult books.^[4] On August 17, 2012, Amazon announced the Hunger Games
   trilogy as its top seller, surpassing the record previously held by the
   Harry Potter series.^[5] As of 2014^[update], the trilogy has sold more
   than 65 million copies in the U.S. alone (more than 28 million copies
   of The Hunger Games, more than 19 million copies of Catching Fire, and
   more than 18 million copies of Mockingjay). The Hunger Games trilogy
   has been sold in 56 territories in 51 languages to date.^[6]

   A prequel novel, titled The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, about the
   early days of the Hunger Games, featuring a young Coriolanus Snow as
   the protagonist, was released on May 19, 2020.^[7]
