   Clara and Nora Callan are sisters, roughly thirty years old. Clara
   lives in her family home in the rural community of Whitfield, near
   Toronto, Ontario, after her father's death, while Nora moves to New
   York to pursue a glamorous career in radio soap operas. Their mother
   died from a possible suicide when Clara, the eldest, was seven. Their
   mother had been known to wander off frequently to the grave of her
   first-born child, so Clara cannot completely dismiss the death as
   accidental. Her father was a principal in a local school and raises the
   two daughters alone.

   Clara now lives the simple life of a school teacher, she plays piano
   and composes poems, although she generally burns the latter after
   writing them. She is an independent woman who finds it difficult to
   live freely in a traditional rural community, especially as she
   realizes she has lost all faith in God. She writes letters to her
   sister and Nora's lesbian writer friend Evelyn Dowling and also
   maintains a journal. She is averse to the technological advances of the
   time, refusing to get a telephone for years and only accepting a radio
   from her sister as it was a Christmas present.

   Nora's letters start narrating how the glamorous life of the big city
   is fake and the events in Clara's life break her solitude. Nora's
   popularity on the radio grows with Evelyn's help. One fateful day in
   1935, when Clara goes out in the evening for a stroll, she is raped by
   two vagabond travelers. Discovering that she is pregnant, Clara reaches
   out to her sister in New York, gets an abortion, and returns to her
   life, hoping it to be peaceful again.

   Global politics begin affecting their lives when Europe approaches
   World War II. Nora convinces Clara to come with her and her latest beau
   to Italy for a month, and they witness firsthand the growing military
   presence of Mussolini's regime.

   In 1937 Clara meets a man named Frank in a movie theater and soon falls
   in love with him. She finds out early on he is in an unhappy marriage
   and continues to see him, even after one of his children warns Clara
   that there are other women. They break up when Clara asks Frank to
   commit to one woman, but reunite briefly a few months later. Evelyn
   moves to California to write for Hollywood.

   Clara is contacted by one of Frank's other women and finally cuts ties
   with him. Unfortunately Clara finds out she is pregnant again but
   decides to have the child, as arranging another abortion without
   Evelyn's help would be far too risky. Clara ponders her past and looks
   for future options. Nora remains supportive and helps when she can.

   The epilogue is written by her daughter Elizabeth, outlining Clara's
   expulsion from teaching, and search for work while raising a child
   alone.
