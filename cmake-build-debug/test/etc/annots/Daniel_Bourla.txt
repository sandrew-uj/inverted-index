   Noah (Strauss), a career soldier, the sole survivor on our planet after
   a nuclear holocaust arrives on an abandoned island, untouched by
   radiation. During his time on the island, the isolation slowly causes
   his grip on sanity to loosen. As the loneliness continues to impact his
   sanity, he creates an imaginary companion, then a companion for his
   companion (played by off-screen voice performances by Geoffrey Holder
   and Sally Kirkland) and finally an entire civilization - a world of
   illusion in which there is no reality but Noah, and no rules but those
   of the extinct world of his memory.

   He then begins to teach lessons to imaginary students in an empty
   classroom. He also commands an imaginary squadron on military maneuvers
   during rain storm.

   His radiation detection badge sounds an alarm, restoring a measure of
   his sanity. Noah realizes that the fallout has reached the island,
   dooming him to a slow and painful death. He lowers his flag to half
   mast and awaits death
