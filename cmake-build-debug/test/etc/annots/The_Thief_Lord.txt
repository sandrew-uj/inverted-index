   The Thief Lord follows the story of two brothers, Prosper and Boniface
   (Bo), who run away to Venice, Italy. They are taken in by a group of
   street children who live in an abandoned movie theater, the Stella, and
   are led by a proud orphan named Scipio. He appears to steal valuables
   and the orphan group sells them to a sly shopkeeper, Ernesto
   Barbarossa. A customer of Barbarossa, calling himself the Conte, asks
   the "Thief Lord" to steal a wooden lion's wing for him. The runaway
   boys' aunt and uncle figure out where they are and set a detective,
   Victor Getz, on their trail. Victor recognizes the boys on the street
   and manages to initiate a conversation with innocent little Bo. Bo
   accidentally lets slip that he lives in old movie theaters. When the
   rest of the children see Victor, they cause a distraction and run away,
   taking his wallet with them. In his search for the theater, Victor
   visits the home of Dottor Massimo, the owner of the Stella, where he
   sees Scipio, who is actually the son of the rich Dottor Massimo.

   When Victor arrives at the Stella, the optic clan ambushes him. When
   Prosper confronts Scipio, he learns that Scipio is indeed Dottor
   Massimo's son. While they are gone, Victor escapes, leaving a note that
   he will not reveal their location if they do not steal the precious
   lion's wing. The children leave that night to steal it from a woman
   called Ida Spavento. Arrived in her house, the children meet Scipio,
   who wants to steal the wing as well. In the following argument, Ida is
   awakened by the racket that the children make and confronts them with
   an old rifle. When they explain, Ida tells them the story of the wing,
   which came from a magical merry-go-round. It has the ability to change
   a person's age. She agrees to let them have the wing if they let her
   accompany them to the exchange. The next night, all of the children go
   for the deal except Hornet and Bo. They join Ida and Scipio, meet with
   the Conte and his sister, Morosina, and make the exchange. They follow
   the Conte through a maze of islands to one in particular called Isola
   Segretta. They watch the pair unload the wing and go inside. Suddenly
   Ida drops the binoculars she was using into the lagoon. The sound
   travels to the island. Morosina rushes out with a shotgun and two huge
   dogs firing away randomly into the night. The group speeds off and
   regroups at the pie. When they return to the theater, Hornet and Bo are
   gone, leaving a note that there were police at the door. They angrily
   confront Victor, who informs them that he did not direct the police's
   attention there. To add to the misery he tells them that the lire they
   received are fake.

   While searching for Hornet and Bo, they find Hornet at an orphanage and
   manage to get her out. However, they did not find Bo at the orphanage.
   They spend a restless night at Ida's house, but Prosper cannot sleep
   and wanders outside, where he meets Scipio. He says that they are going
   to get the money that is rightfully theirs. They travel back to the
   island and get caught in the act of climbing a wall by the Conte's
   sister. The two end up locked up in a stinking stable on the island.
   Meanwhile, Victor receives a phone call from Esther, informing him that
   she had Bo, but that he had misbehaved and run away from them. Victor
   finds Bo at the Stella and takes him back to Ida's, where they find
   Prosper missing.

   On the island the next morning, Scipio and Prosper meet the Conte and
   Morosina, who are both young children. They tell him that the magical
   merry go-round worked. Scipio demands a ride and comes off an adult.
   Just as he gets off the merry-go-round, Barbarossa, the man who found
   the Conte and hired the Thief Lord for the job of stealing the wing,
   arrives. However, while Barbarossa becomes a seven-year-old boy, he
   accidentally breaks the magical merry-go-round. Scipio and Prosper
   leave after promising the Conte that they will not talk about the
   merry-go-round, and Barbarossa will be forced to give the Conte all the
   money in his shop safe. The next day, when everyone at Ida's home finds
   Prosper, Scipio, and Barbarossa. They do not recognize Scipio or
   Barbarossa and Prosper cannot explain. Scipio sets up a meeting between
   Barbarossa and Esther. Esther adores Barbarossa and his manners and
   decides to adopt him. Prosper, Bo, and Hornet decide to live with Ida
   and go to school, while Mosca and Riccio live in an abandoned
   warehouse. Scipio decides to work for Victor.

   Eventually, he and Prosper take another trip to the Isola Segreta only
   to find that the Conte and Morosina have disappeared. Esther eventually
   catches Barbarossa stealing her jewelry and other possessions and sends
   him off to boarding school, where he becomes a menacing bully; he
   forces other children to do things for him like his homework,
   encourages them to steal, and intimidates them to call him "The Thief
   Lord". Scipio, when he becomes an adult, he works as Victor's assistant
   in his detective agency and he was freed from his father's envy and
   cruelty.
