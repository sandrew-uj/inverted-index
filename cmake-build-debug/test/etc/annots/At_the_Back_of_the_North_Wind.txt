   The book tells the story of a young boy named Diamond. He is a very
   sweet little boy who makes joy everywhere he goes. He fights despair
   and gloom and brings peace to his family. One night, as he is trying to
   sleep, Diamond repeatedly plugs up a hole in the loft (also his
   bedroom) wall to stop the wind from blowing in. However, he soon finds
   out that this is stopping the North Wind from seeing through her
   window. Diamond befriends her, and North Wind lets him fly with her,
   taking him on several adventures. Though the North Wind does good deeds
   and helps people, she also does seemingly terrible things. On one of
   her assignments, she must sink a ship. Yet everything she does that
   seems bad leads to something good. The North Wind seems to be a
   representation of Pain and Death working according to God's will for
   something good.
