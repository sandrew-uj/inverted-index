   Robert Neville appears to be the sole survivor of a pandemic that has
   killed most of the human population and turned the remainder into
   "vampires" that largely conform to their stereotypes in fiction and
   folklore: they are blood-sucking, pale-skinned, and nocturnal, though
   otherwise indistinguishable from normal humans. Implicitly set in Los
   Angeles during 1976, the novel details Neville's life in the months and
   eventually years after the outbreak as he attempts to comprehend,
   research, and possibly cure the disease. Swarms of vampires surround
   his house nightly and try to find ways to get inside, which includes
   the females exposing themselves and his vampire neighbor relentlessly
   shouting for him to come out. Neville survives by barricading himself
   inside his house every night; he is further protected by the
   traditional vampire repellents of garlic, mirrors, and crucifixes.
   Weekly dust storms ravage the city, and during the day, when the
   vampires are inactive, Neville drives around to search them out in
   order to kill them with wooden stakes (since they seem impervious to
   his guns' bullets) and to scavenge for supplies. Neville's past is
   occasionally revealed through flashbacks; the disease claimed his
   daughter, whose body the government forced him to burn, as well as his
   wife, whose body he secretly buried but then had to kill after she rose
   from the dead as a vampire.

   After bouts of depression and alcoholism, Neville finally determines
   there must be some scientific reasons behind the vampires' origins,
   behaviors, and aversions, so he sets out to investigate. He obtains
   books and other research materials from a library and through gradual
   research discovers the root of the disease is probably a Bacillus
   strain of bacteria capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts.
   His experiments with microscopes also reveal that the bacteria are
   deadly sensitive to garlic and sunlight. One day, a stray, injured dog
   finds its way to his street, filling Neville with amazed joy. Desperate
   for company, Neville painstakingly earns the nervous dog's trust with
   food and brings it into the home. Despite his efforts, the sickly dog
   dies a week later, and Neville, robbed of all hope, resignedly returns
   to learning more about the vampires.

   Neville's continued readings and experiments on incapacitated vampires
   help him create new theories. He believes vampires are affected by
   mirrors and crosses because of "hysterical blindness", the result of
   previous psychological conditioning of the infected. Driven insane by
   the disease, the infected now react as they believe they should when
   confronted with these items. Even then, their reaction is constrained
   to the beliefs of the particular person; for example, a Christian
   vampire would fear the cross, but a Jewish vampire would not. Neville
   additionally discovers more efficient means of killing the vampires,
   other than just driving a stake into their hearts. This includes
   exposing vampires to direct sunlight or inflicting wide,
   oxygen-exposing wounds anywhere on their bodies so that the bacteria
   switch from being anaerobic symbionts to aerobic parasites, rapidly
   consuming their hosts when exposed to air, which gives the appearance
   of the vampires instantly liquefying. However, the bacteria also
   produce resilient "body glue" that instantly seals blunt or narrow
   wounds, making the vampires bulletproof. With his new knowledge,
   Neville is killing such large numbers of vampires in his daily forays
   that his nightly visitors have diminished significantly. Neville
   further believes the pandemic was spread not so much by direct vampire
   bites as by bacteria-bearing mosquitos and dust storms in the cities
   following a recent war. The inconsistency of Neville's results in
   handling vampires also leads him to realize that there are in fact two
   differently-reacting types of vampires: those conscious and living with
   a worsening infection and those who have died but been reanimated by
   the bacteria (i.e. undead).

   After three years, Neville sees a terrified woman in broad daylight.
   Neville is immediately suspicious after she recoils violently in the
   presence of garlic, but they slowly win each other's trust. Eventually,
   the two comfort each other romantically and he explains some of his
   findings, including his theory that he developed immunity against the
   infection after being bitten by an infected vampire bat years ago. He
   wants to know if the woman, named Ruth, is infected or immune, vowing
   to treat her if she is infected, and she reluctantly allows him to take
   a blood sample but suddenly knocks him unconscious as he views the
   results. When Neville wakes, he discovers a note from Ruth confessing
   that she is indeed a vampire sent to spy on him and that he was
   responsible for the death of her husband, another vampire. The note
   further suggests that only the undead vampires are pathologically
   violent but not those who were alive at the time of infection and who
   still survive due to chance mutations in their bacteria. These
   living-infected have slowly overcome their disease and are attempting
   to build a new society. They have developed medication that diminishes
   the worst of their symptoms. Ruth warns Neville that her feelings for
   him are true but that her people will attempt to capture him and that
   he should try to escape the city.

   However, assuming he will be treated fairly by the new society, Neville
   stays at his house until infected members arrive and violently dispatch
   the undead vampires outside his house with fiendish glee. Realizing the
   infected attackers may intend to kill him after all, he fires on them
   and in turn is shot and captured. Fatally wounded, Neville is placed in
   a barred cell where he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is
   a senior member of the new society but, unlike the others, does not
   resent him. After discussing the effects of Neville's vampire-killing
   activities on the new society, she acknowledges the public need for
   Neville's execution but, out of mercy, gives him a packet of
   fast-acting suicide pills. Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not
   to let this society become too heartless. Ruth promises to try, kisses
   him, and leaves. Neville goes to his prison window and sees the
   infected staring back at him with the same hatred and fear that he once
   felt for them; he realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a
   legend to the new race born of the infection. He recognizes that their
   desire to kill him, after he has killed so many of their loved ones, is
   not something he can condemn. As the pills take effect, he is amused by
   the thought that he will become their new superstition and legend, just
   as vampires once were to humans.
