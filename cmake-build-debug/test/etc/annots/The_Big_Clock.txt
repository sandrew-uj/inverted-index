   The novel's innovative structure is presented from the point-of-view of
   seven different characters. Each of the 19 chapters adopts the
   perspective of a single character. The first five chapters are told by
   George Stroud, who works for a New York magazine publisher not unlike
   Time-Life.

   Stroud is a borderline alcoholic and serial adulterer. His latest
   affair is with Pauline, who is also the girlfriend of his boss, Earl
   Janoth. After a weekend together in upstate New York, George and
   Pauline spend a leisurely evening in Manhattan--eating dinner,
   bar-hopping, and browsing antique stores. George is a collector of the
   artist Louise Patterson and finds one of her works in shabby condition
   in an antique store. He outbids another customer for it. (The other
   customer turns out to be Patterson herself.) Later, George leaves
   Pauline at a corner near her Manhattan apartment. He watches her
   approach the entrance and sees Earl emerge from a limousine and enter
   the building with her. Earl sees George observing him, but, crucially,
   he cannot make him out in the shadows.

   In Pauline's apartment, she and Earl have a violent argument in which
   he accuses her of being a cheat and a lesbian. In reply, she suggests
   that he and his close associate, Steve Hagen, are a gay couple. This
   enrages Earl and he bludgeons her to death with a crystal decanter. In
   a panic, he goes to Steve's apartment for assistance. Steve immediately
   begins planning a coverup and tells Earl he must be prepared to have
   the man who witnessed him enter the building killed. Earl reluctantly
   agrees.

   Earl and Steve employ all of the resources of the publishing firm to
   find the mysterious witness--not realizing that he is right under their
   noses. They put George in charge of the investigation, as he is their
   sharpest editor. George sets the investigation in motion, but craftily
   subverts its chance for success.

   Despite the roadblocks George puts in the way of the investigation
   identifying him as the witness, he comes closer and closer to being
   found. Eventually, witnesses are brought to the publishing house's
   building, because it is said that the sought-after individual (name
   still unknown) is inside. The building is being searched floor-by-floor
   and it appears inevitable that Stroud will be caught, but Earl snaps
   under the pressure and surrenders his company to a unfavorable merger.
   His leaving the company suddenly makes the manhunt moot and it is
   quickly terminated, without the witnesses seeing George.

   The story ends with George meeting Louise in a quirky bar, where they
   discuss the dispensation of her works. As George leaves to meet his
   wife for dinner, he see a newspaper with the headline, "EARL JANOTH,
   OUSTED PUBLISHER, PLUNGES TO DEATH."
