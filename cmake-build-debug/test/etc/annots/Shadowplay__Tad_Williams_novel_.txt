   Darkness has fallen on the lands of the sun as an army of misshapen fey
   spill out from beyond the Shadowline. At their head is Yasammez, dark
   creature of nightmare. A furtive bargain was struck at the gates of
   Southmarch and the castle was spared, but centuries of enmity will not
   be so easily appeased. Meanwhile, Barrick, heir to Southmarch and
   cursed with madness, has crossed the Shadowline into the realm of his
   people's ancient enemy. There are stranger things than death here -
   stranger and older. Much further south, shadow is also falling over the
   reign of the Autarch, god-king, and supreme ruler. Qinnitan, junior
   wife, must flee the royal household or die, her greatest secret as yet
   hidden even from herself. Ancient blood flows through her veins and she
   will become a unique weapon in the fight against her greatest terror.
   And beyond the ken of all but a chosen few, the gods are awakening and
   the world is changing.
