   The book recounts Didion's experiences of grief after Dunne's 2003
   death. Days before his death, their daughter Quintana Roo Dunne Michael
   was hospitalized in New York with pneumonia which developed into septic
   shock; she was still unconscious when her father died. During 2004
   Quintana was again hospitalized after she fell and hit her head
   disembarking from a plane in Malibu. She had returned to Malibu, her
   childhood home, after learning of her father's death.

   The book follows Didion's reliving and reanalysis of her husband's
   death throughout the year following it, in addition to caring for
   Quintana. With each replay of the event, the focus on certain emotional
   and physical aspects of the experience shifts. Didion also incorporates
   medical and psychological research on grief and illness into the book.

   The title of the book refers to magical thinking in the anthropological
   sense, thinking that if a person hopes for something enough or performs
   the right actions that an unavoidable event can be averted. Didion
   reports many instances of her own magical thinking, particularly the
   story in which she cannot give away Dunne's shoes, as he would need
   them when he returned. The experience of insanity or derangement
   that is part of grief is a major theme, about which Didion was unable
   to find a great deal of existing literature.

   Didion applies the reportorial detachment for which she is known to her
   own experience of grieving; there are few expressions of raw emotion.
   Through observation and analysis of changes in her own behavior and
   abilities, she indirectly expresses the toll her grief is taking. She
   is haunted by questions about the medical details of her husband's
   death, the possibility that he sensed it in advance, and how she might
   have made his remaining time more meaningful. Fleeting memories of
   events and persistent snippets of past conversations with John take on
   a new significance. Her daughter's continuing health problems and
   hospitalizations further compound and interrupt the natural course of
   grief.
