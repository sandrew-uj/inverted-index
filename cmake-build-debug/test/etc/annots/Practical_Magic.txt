   Maria Owens, a young witch, is exiled to Maria's Island in
   Massachusetts with her unborn child for escaping her execution. When
   her lover does not come to rescue her, she desperately casts a spell
   upon herself to stop falling in love due to heartbreak, only to die
   soon after. The spell becomes a curse for several generations. In the
   present day, Gillian and Sally Owens, two descendants of the Owens
   family, are taken in by their aunts Frances and Jet after the death of
   their parents. Sally is the more gifted of the two while Gillian's
   talents are more in charm and persuasion, and have been subject to
   ridicule during their youth. After witnessing their aunts cast a spell
   on a man for a woman who seems obsessed with having his love, Gillian
   decides to fall in love and Sally casts a true love spell to protect
   herself.

   The sisters cast an oath to each other using blood from both of their
   hands and Gillian leaves for Los Angeles. Sally meets and marries
   Michael, a local apple salesman. Years later, the two open their
   botanical shop Verbena and have two young daughters, Kylie and Antonia.
   Michael is killed after being hit by a truck. Sally and her daughters
   return to the Owens home to live with the aunts, and realize that the
   aunts cast a spell so she could fall in love. Sally decides that she
   and her daughters will not perform magic. As Gillian begins a
   relationship with Jimmy Angelov in Orlando, Sally is devastated by her
   husband's death. Gillian feels that Sally needs her and drugs Jimmy to
   return to Massachusetts.

   Gillian calls Sally from a motel, where she has been abused by Jimmy.
   When Sally arrives, Jimmy kidnaps them. Sally puts belladonna into
   Jimmy's tequila, inadvertently killing him. The sisters resurrect him
   using the forbidden spell from their aunts' book of spells, but Jimmy
   attempts to kill Gillian after being revived. Sally kills him again,
   and the sisters bury his remains in their home's garden. State
   investigator Gary Hallett arrives from Tucson, Arizona in search of
   Jimmy, who is also a serial killer. As Gary begins to suspect Sally,
   Gillian, Kylie and Antonia create a potion to banish Gary; however, the
   girls realize he is the one described in Sally's true love spell, and
   remove the potion. Later, Sally has Gary record her testimony and sees
   the letter she had once written Gillian, and realizes he must have read
   it more times than he had let on. Unable to deny their feelings for
   each other, they kiss and Sally realizes that he was there because of
   the spell she cast years earlier.

   Sally discovers that Jimmy's spirit has possessed Gillian's body and
   Gary sees Jimmy's spirit emerge. Jimmy attempts to possess Gary, only
   to be hurt by his silver star-shaped badge and is temporarily exiled.
   Later, Sally tells Gary that he is there because of her spell and the
   feelings they have for each other are not real. Gary replies that
   curses are only true if one believes in them and reveals that he also
   wished for her, before returning to Tucson.

   Jimmy possesses Gillian again and attempts to kill Sally before Frances
   and Jet return. Sally, realizing she must embrace magic to save her
   sister, asks the aid of the townswomen and they form a coven to
   exorcise Jimmy's spirit. Sally makes them stop when she sees that the
   effort might kill Gillian. Getting inside the circle, Sally and the
   townswomen reenact her oath with Gillian. They are able to break the
   Owens curse, exorcising Jimmy's spirit and allowing the coven to exile
   him permanently. After leaving for Tucson, Gary clears the sisters of
   any suspicion of wrongdoing in Jimmy's case and decides to return to
   Massachusetts to be with Sally. The Owens women celebrate All Hallow's
   Eve dressed up in witch costumes, and are embraced and welcomed by the
   townsfolk.
