   Ambitious, handsome, but poorly educated, naive, and immature, Clyde
   Griffiths is raised by poor and devoutly religious parents to help in
   their street missionary work. As a young adult, Clyde must, to help
   support his family, take menial jobs as a soda jerk, then a bellhop at
   a prestigious Kansas City hotel. There, his more sophisticated
   colleagues introduce him to bouts of social drinking and sex with
   prostitutes.

   Enjoying his new lifestyle, Clyde becomes infatuated with manipulative
   Hortense Briggs, who persuades him to buy her expensive gifts. When
   Clyde learns Hortense goes out with other men, he becomes jealous.
   Still Clyde would rather spend money on Hortense than to help his
   sister, who had eloped, only to end up pregnant and abandoned by her
   lover.

   Clyde's life changes dramatically when his friend Sparser, driving
   Clyde, Hortense, and other friends back from a secluded rendezvous in
   the country in his boss's car, used without permission, hits a little
   girl and kills her. Fleeing from the police at high speed, Sparser
   crashes the car. Everyone but Sparser and his partner flee the scene of
   the crime. Clyde leaves Kansas City, fearing prosecution as an
   accessory to Sparser's crimes. This pattern of personal
   irresponsibility and panicked decision-making in Clyde's life recurs in
   the story, culminating in the central tragedy of the novel.

   While working as a bellboy at an exclusive club in Chicago, he meets
   his wealthy uncle Samuel Griffiths, the owner of a shirt-collar factory
   in the fictional city of Lycurgus, New York. Samuel, feeling guilt for
   neglecting his poor relations, offers Clyde a menial job at the
   factory. After that, he promotes Clyde to a minor supervisory role.

   Samuel Griffiths's son Gilbert, Clyde's immediate supervisor, warns
   Clyde that as a manager, he should not consort with women working under
   his supervision. At the same time the Griffithses pay Clyde little
   attention socially. As Clyde has no close friends in Lycurgus, he
   becomes lonely. Emotionally vulnerable, Clyde is drawn to Roberta
   Alden, a poor and innocent farm girl working in his shop, who falls in
   love with him. Clyde secretly courts Roberta, ultimately persuading her
   to have sex with him rather than lose him, and she becomes pregnant.

   At the same time, elegant young socialite Sondra Finchley, daughter of
   another Lycurgus factory owner, takes an interest in Clyde despite his
   cousin Gilbert's efforts to keep them apart. Clyde's engaging manner
   makes him popular among the young smart set of Lycurgus; he and Sondra
   become close, and he courts her while neglecting Roberta. Roberta
   expects Clyde to marry her to avert the shame of an unwed pregnancy,
   but Clyde now dreams instead of marrying Sondra.

   Having failed to procure an abortion for Roberta, Clyde gives her no
   more than desultory help with living expenses while his relationship
   with Sondra matures. When Roberta threatens to reveal her relationship
   with Clyde unless he marries her, he plans to murder her by drowning
   while they go boating. He had read a local newspaper report of a
   boating accident.

   Clyde takes Roberta out in a canoe on the fictional Big Bittern Lake
   (modeled on Big Moose Lake, New York) in the Adirondacks, and rows to a
   secluded bay. He freezes. Sensing something wrong, Roberta moves toward
   him, and he unintentionally strikes her in the face with a camera,
   stunning her and accidentally capsizing the boat. Roberta, unable to
   swim, drowns, while Clyde, unwilling to save her, swims to shore. The
   narrative implies that the blow was accidental, but the trail of
   circumstantial evidence left by the panicky and guilt-ridden Clyde
   points to murder.

   The local authorities are eager to convict Clyde, to the point of
   manufacturing additional evidence against him, but he repeatedly
   incriminates himself with his confused and contradictory testimony.
   Clyde has a sensational trial before an unsympathetic and prejudiced
   jury of mostly religiously conservative farmers. Despite a vigorous
   (and untruthful) defense by two lawyers hired by his uncle, Clyde is
   convicted, sentenced to death, and after an appeal is denied, he is
   executed by electric chair. The jailhouse scenes and correspondence
   between Clyde and his mother are exemplars of pathos in modern
   literature.
