   Each volume of the Chronicles of Kylix is set on a different world in
   the magical solar system of the fictional star Kylix in the
   constellation of the Unicorn. The system consists of the five planets
   Zao, Olymbris, Thoorana, Zephrondus and Gulzund. The Wizard of Zao
   takes place on Zao.^[2]

   Oolb Votz, the titular wonder-working wizard, fat, green and full of
   himself, makes an unlikely hero, but nonetheless has a humorous romp of
   a quest he must undertake. He is accompanied on his journey by the
   15-year-old Wild Girl Ooo, his newly purchased chela, who assists him
   as servant, apprentice and concubine. Strange beasts and stranger
   people are encountered along the way. The true identity of the wizard,
   a mystery in itself, is revealed in a surprise ending. The narrative is
   spiced with authorial asides and footnotes.
