   Told as a flashback to the early 21st century, with a wraparound
   sequence narrated by the orangutan Lawgiver in "North America - 2670
   A.D.", this sequel follows the chimpanzee Caesar years after a global
   nuclear war has destroyed human civilization. Living with his wife,
   Lisa and their son, Cornelius, Caesar creates a new society while
   trying to cultivate peace between the apes and remaining humans. Caesar
   is opposed by an aggressive gorilla general named Aldo, who wants to
   imprison the humans who freely roam Ape City while doing menial labor.

   After defusing followers of Aldo who attacked a human teacher for
   saying "No" to apes, Caesar ponders if his own parents could have
   taught him how to make things better. MacDonald, Caesar's human
   assistant and the younger brother of MacDonald (from Conquest of the
   Planet of the Apes) reveals to Caesar that his brother told him of
   archived footage of Cornelius and Zira within the underground, now
   radioactive ruins of what is known as the Forbidden City from the last
   film. Caesar travels with MacDonald and his orangutan advisor Virgil to
   the Forbidden City to find the archives.

   It is revealed that mutated and radiation-scarred humans are living
   within the city, under the command of Governor Kolp, the man who once
   captured Caesar. Caesar and his party view the recordings of his
   parents, learning about the future and Earth's eventual destruction
   before they are forced to flee when Kolp's soldiers hunt them. Fearing
   the mutant humans may attack Ape City, Caesar reports his discoveries.
   When Caesar calls MacDonald and a select group of humans to the
   meeting, Aldo leads the gorillas away.

   Kolp's scouts find Ape City. Believing Caesar is planning to finish off
   all mutant humans, Kolp declares war on Ape City despite his assistant
   Mendez's attempt to get him to see reason. Aldo plots a coup d'etat in
   order for the gorillas to take control. Cornelius overhears from a
   nearby tree, but is critically wounded when Aldo spots him and hacks
   off the tree branch he is on with his sword. The next day, after a
   gorilla scouting pair are attacked by Kolp's men, Aldo takes advantage
   of a grieving Caesar's absence to have all humans corralled while
   looting the armory. Cornelius eventually dies from his wounds, leaving
   a devastated Caesar with the revelation that Cornelius was not hurt by
   humans.

   When Kolp's ragtag force launches their attack, Caesar orders the
   defenders to fall back. Finding Caesar lying among dozens of fallen
   apes, Kolp expresses his intention to personally kill him. The apes,
   however, are merely feigning death and launch a counterattack that
   captures most of the mutant humans. Kolp and his remaining forces try
   to escape, only to be slaughtered by Aldo's troops once they are out in
   the open.

   Aldo confronts Caesar about releasing the corralled local humans and
   orders the gorillas to kill them. When Caesar shields the humans and
   Aldo threatens him, Virgil (having learned the truth from MacDonald)
   reveals Aldo's role in Cornelius's death. Enraged with Aldo for
   breaking their most sacred law, all the apes chant 'Ape has killed
   ape'. An infuriated Caesar pursues Aldo up a large tree, their
   confrontation resulting in Aldo falling to his death.

   With Caesar realizing that apes are no different than their former
   human slaveowners as Aldo proved, he agrees to MacDonald's request for
   humans to be treated as equals, co-existing in a new society. They
   store their guns in the armory; Caesar and Virgil reluctantly explain
   to the armory's overseer, an orangutan named Mandemas, that they will
   still need their weapons for future conflicts and can only wait for the
   day when they will no longer need them.

   The scene returns to the Lawgiver, saying it has now been over 600
   years since Caesar's death. His audience is revealed to be a group of
   young humans and apes, the Lawgiver noting that their society still
   waits for a day when their world will no longer need weapons, while
   they "wait with hope". A closeup of a statue of Caesar shows a single
   tear falling from one eye.
