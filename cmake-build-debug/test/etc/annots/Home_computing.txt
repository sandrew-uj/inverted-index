   Computer at home, USA 1965

   As early as 1965, some experimental projects, such as Jim Sutherland's
   ECHO IV, explored the possible utility of a computer in the
   home. In 1969, the Honeywell Kitchen Computer was marketed as
   a luxury gift item, and would have inaugurated the era of home
   computing, but none were sold.

   Computers became affordable for the general public in the 1970s due to
   the mass production of the microprocessor starting in 1971. Early
   microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 had front-mounted switches and
   diagnostic lights (nicknamed "blinkenlights") to control and indicate
   internal system status, and were often sold in kit form to hobbyists.
   These kits would contain an empty printed circuit board which the buyer
   would fill with the integrated circuits, other individual electronic
   components, wires and connectors, and then hand-solder all the
   connections.

   While two early home computers (Sinclair ZX80 and Acorn Atom) could be
   bought either in kit form or assembled, most home computers were only
   sold pre-assembled. They were enclosed in plastic or metal cases
   similar in appearance to typewriter or hi-fi equipment enclosures,
   which were more familiar and attractive to consumers than the
   industrial metal card-cage enclosures used by the Altair and similar
   computers. The keyboard - a feature lacking on the Altair - was usually
   built into the same case as the motherboard. Ports for plug-in
   peripheral devices such as a video display, cassette tape recorders,
   joysticks, and (later) disk drives were either built-in or available on
   expansion cards. Although the Apple II series had internal expansion
   slots, most other home computer models' expansion arrangements were
   through externally accessible 'expansion ports' that also served as a
   place to plug in cartridge-based games. Usually the manufacturer would
   sell peripheral devices designed to be compatible with their computers
   as extra cost accessories. Peripherals and software were not often
   interchangeable between different brands of home computer, or even
   between successive models of the same brand.

   To save the cost of a dedicated monitor, the home computer would often
   connect through an RF modulator to the family TV set, which served as
   both video display and sound system.

   By 1982, an estimated 621,000 home computers were in American
   households, at an average sales price of US$530 (equivalent to $1,421
   in 2020). After the success of the Radio Shack TRS-80, the
   Commodore PET and the Apple II in 1977, almost every manufacturer of
   consumer electronics rushed to introduce a home computer. Large numbers
   of new machines of all types began to appear during the late 1970s and
   early 1980s. Mattel, Coleco, Texas Instruments and Timex, none of which
   had any prior connection to the computer industry, all had short-lived
   home computer lines in the early 1980s. Some home computers were more
   successful - the BBC Micro, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Atari 800XL and
   Commodore 64 sold many units over several years and attracted
   third-party software development.

   Almost universally, home computers had a BASIC interpreter combined
   with a line editor in permanent read-only memory which one could use to
   type in BASIC programs and execute them immediately or save them to
   tape or disk. In direct mode, the BASIC interpreter was also used as
   the user interface, and given tasks such as loading, saving, managing,
   and running files. One exception was the Jupiter Ace, which had a
   Forth interpreter instead of BASIC. A built-in programming language was
   seen as a requirement for any computer of the era, and was the main
   feature setting home computers apart from video game consoles.

   Still, home computers competed in the same market as the consoles. A
   home computer was often seen as simply as a higher end purchase than a
   console, adding abilities and productivity potential to what would
   still be mainly a gaming device. A common marketing tactic was to show
   a computer system and console playing games side by side, then
   emphasizing the computer's greater ability by showing it running
   user-created programs, education software, word processing, spreadsheet
   and other applications while the game console showed a blank screen or
   continued playing the same repetitive game. Another capability home
   computers had that game consoles of the time lacked was the ability to
   access remote services over telephone lines by adding a serial port
   interface, a modem, and communication software. Though it could be
   costly, it permitted the computer user to access services like
   Compuserve and private or corporate bulletin board systems to post or
   read messages, or to download or upload software. Some enthusiasts with
   computers equipped with large storage capacity and a dedicated phone
   line operated bulletin boards of their own. This capability anticipated
   the internet by nearly twenty years.

   Some game consoles offered "programming packs" consisting of a version
   of BASIC in a ROM cartridge. Atari's BASIC Programming for the Atari
   2600 was one of these. For the ColecoVision console, Coleco even
   announced an expansion module which would convert it into a
   full-fledged computer system. The Magnavox Odyssey2 game console had a
   built-in keyboard to support its C7420 Home Computer Module.

   Books of type-in program listings like BASIC Computer Games were
   available dedicated for the BASICs of most models of computer with
   titles along the lines of 64 Amazing BASIC Games for the Commodore
   64. While most of the programs in these books were short and
   simple games or demos, some titles such as Compute!'s SpeedScript
   series, contained productivity software that rivaled commercial
   packages. To avoid the tedious process of typing in a program listing
   from a book, these books would sometimes include a mail-in offer from
   the author to obtain the programs on disk or cassette for a few
   dollars. Before the Internet, and before most computer owners had a
   modem, books were a popular and low-cost means of software
   distribution--one that had the advantage of incorporating its own
   documentation. These books also served a role in familiarizing new
   computer owners with the concepts of programming; some titles added
   suggested modifications to the program listings for the user to carry
   out. Applying a patch to modify software to be compatible with one's
   system or writing a utility program to fit one's needs was a skill
   every advanced computer owner was expected to have.

   During the peak years of the home computer market, scores of models
   were produced, usually as individual design projects with little or no
   thought given to compatibility between different manufacturers or even
   within product lines of the same manufacturer. Except for the
   Japanese MSX standard, the concept of a computer platform was
   still forming, with most companies considering rudimentary BASIC
   language and disk format compatibility sufficient to claim a model as
   "compatible". Things were different in the business world, where
   cost-conscious small business owners had been using CP/M running on Z80
   based computers from Osborne, Kaypro, Morrow Designs and a host of
   other manufacturers. For many of these businesses, the development of
   the microcomputer made computing and business software affordable where
   they had not been before.

   Introduced in August 1981, the IBM Personal Computer would eventually
   supplant CP/M as the standard platform used in business. This was
   largely due to the IBM name and the system's 16 bit open architecture,
   which expanded maximum memory tenfold, and also encouraged production
   of third-party clones. In the late 1970s, the 6502-based Apple II
   series had carved out a niche for itself in business, thanks to the
   industry's first killer app, VisiCalc, released in 1979. However the
   Apple II would quickly be displaced for office use by IBM PC
   compatibles running Lotus 1-2-3. Apple Computer's 1980 Apple III
   was underwhelming, and although the 1984 release of the Apple Macintosh
   introduced the modern GUI to the market, it wasn't common until
   IBM-compatible computers adopted it. Throughout the 1980s,
   businesses large and small adopted the PC platform, leading, by the end
   of the decade, to sub-US$1000 IBM PC XT-class white box machines,
   usually built in Asia and sold by US companies like PCs Limited.

   In 1980 Wayne Green, the publisher of Kilobaud Microcomputing,
   recommended that companies avoid the term "home computer" in their
   advertising as "I feel is self-limiting for sales ... I prefer the term
   "microcomputers" since it doesn't limit the uses of the equipment in
   the imagination of the prospective customers". With the exception
   of Tandy, most computer companies - even those with a majority of
   sales to home users - agreed, avoiding the term "home computer" because
   of its association with the image of, as Compute! wrote, "a
   low-powered, low-end machine primarily suited for playing games". Apple
   consistently avoided stating that it was a home-computer company, and
   described the IIc as "a serious computer for the serious home user"
   despite competing against IBM's PCjr home computer. John Sculley denied
   that his company sold home computers; rather, he said, Apple sold
   "computers for use in the home". In 1990 the company
   reportedly refused to support joysticks on its low-cost Macintosh LC
   and IIsi computers to prevent customers from considering them as "game
   machines".

   Although the Apple II and Atari computers are functionally similar,
   Atari's home-oriented marketing resulted in a game-heavy library with
   much less business software. By the late 1980s, many mass
   merchants sold video game consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment
   System, but no longer sold home computers.

   Toward the end of the 1980s, clones also became popular with
   non-corporate customers. Inexpensive, highly compatible clones
   succeeded where the PCjr had failed. Replacing the hobbyists who had
   made up the majority of the home computer market were, as Compute!
   described them, "people who want to take work home from the office now
   and then, play a game now and then, learn more about computers, and
   help educate their children". By 1986 industry experts predicted an
   "MS-DOS Christmas", and the magazine stated that clones threatened
   Commodore, Atari, and Apple's domination of the home-computer
   market.

   The declining cost of IBM compatibles on the one hand, and the greatly
   increased graphics, sound, and storage abilities of fourth generation
   video game consoles such as the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo
   Entertainment System on the other, combined to cause the market segment
   for home computers to vanish by the early 1990s in the US. In Europe,
   the home computer remained a distinct presence for a few years more,
   with the low-end models of the 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST families being
   the dominant players, but by the mid-1990s even the European market had
   dwindled. The Dutch government even ran a program that allowed
   businesses to sell computers tax-free to its employees, often
   accompanied by home training programs. Naturally, these businesses
   chose to equip their employees with the same systems they themselves
   were using. Today a computer bought for home use anywhere will be very
   similar to those used in offices - made by the same manufacturers, with
   compatible peripherals, operating systems, and application software.
