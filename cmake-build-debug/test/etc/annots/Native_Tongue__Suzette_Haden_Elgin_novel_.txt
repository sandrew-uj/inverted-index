   Native Tongue follows Nazareth, a talented female linguist in the 22nd
   century - generations after the repeal of the 19th Amendment. Nazareth
   is part of a small group of linguists "bred" to become perfect
   interstellar translators.^[2]

   Nazareth looks forward to retiring to the Barren House - where women
   past childbearing age go as they wait to die - but learns that the
   women of the Barren Houses are creating a language to help them break
   free of male dominance.
