   The story is divided into three sections:

          Part I: G who waits
          Part II: S the watchful
          Part III: The house and the watchers

   In New Worlds these sections are divided into fourteen chapters, with
   Part II beginning half way through chapter six and ending in chapter
   eleven. In the Faber edition the three sections are divided into
   sixteen chapters, with six chapters each in Parts I and II and four
   chapters in Part III.

   The bulk of the novel is the titular report, which describes in
   objective, repetitive and seemingly trivial detail the bizarre
   activity, taking place one overcast January day, apparently in England,
   around a suburban house in which a writer, Mr. Mary, lives with his
   wife. In the grounds of the house are various outbuildings which are
   occupied by three of the Marys' ex-employees: the gardener "G" is in a
   wooden hut, or summerhouse, some ten metres north-west of the house;
   Mr. Mary's former secretary "S" is in the upper room of a brick
   outhouse - a former stable or coach house - at the end of the back
   garden; and the chauffeur "C" is in a small loft above the garage a
   metre and a half from the south-east wall of the house. Thus the
   gardener (G) is in a summerhouse (S), the secretary (S) in a coach
   house (C) and the chauffeur (C) in a garage (G), achieving a kind of
   linguistic circularity.

   All three men are watching the house from their various vantage points
   and occasionally see Mr. or Mrs. Mary entering or leaving the house or
   passing within view of a window. The Marys know they are being watched
   and are evidently upset, and there is some hostility between the men,
   who avoid each other. The Mary's housekeeper checks on the men from
   time to time and they each ask her what Mr. and Mrs. Mary are doing.
   Each also visits a cafe across the road which never has any other
   customers, and they eat poached haddock or drink coffee (though no one
   pays) and engage in stilted conversations with the proprietor Mr. Watt
   about a strike at a local factory. These conversations are given in the
   form of quoted speeches with no names ascribed. Mr. Watt is also
   watching the Mary's house and each man asks him what he has seen. They
   are particularly interested in Mr. Mary's wife, and Mr. Mary is later
   seen at one of the windows brandishing a gun. The atmosphere is
   menacing and claustrophobic, and it seems that something dreadful is
   about to happen.

   The report itself is being compiled in another "continuum" where two
   characters, Domoladossa and Midlakemela, speculate on its meaning and
   whether the inhabitants of the world they call "Probability A" are
   human. Domoladossa believes that Mr. Mary's wife is the key to the
   mystery and later questions whether events in her world are being
   "interfered with by reason of their being observed" in his. He is
   unaware that a framed photograph of his own wife, which sits on his
   desk, is a portal to a third world where he is being watched by four
   Distinguishers on a hillside, who in turn are unaware that a robot fly
   is transmitting a live feed to a large screen in a building in New York
   City where they are being watched by a group of men, who are likewise
   being watched by two young men and a boy in an empty warehouse who
   think they have discovered a time machine. "And", reveals Aldiss,
   "there were watchers watching them, and they too had watchers, who also
   had watchers, and so on, and so on", while "Mr. Mary's wife sat at her
   own screen and regarded the cycle of universes as night closed in" and
   C lay in the loft above the garage, contemplating a picture of two
   snakes swallowing each other's tail like an ouroboros.

   A motif added by Aldiss in the Faber edition of the novel is The
   Hireling Shepherd, a painting by the Pre-Raphaelite artist William
   Holman Hunt which is thought to have multiple interpretations and
   possibly a hidden meaning. There are copies of the painting in the
   outbuildings occupied by G, S and C, and it also exists in
   Domoladossa's world, where it is attributed to a "Russian-born German
   of British extraction" named Winkel Henri Hunt. A detail from the
   painting is reproduced in black and white on the dust jacket of the
   Faber edition, and superimposed on the reproduction is a picture of a
   book with the words LOW POINT X on its cover in pink block capitals.
   The book lies on the grass in the foreground of the painting and is one
   of the books on a shelf in the upper room of the outhouse occupied by
   S. It may also be a reference to "the pigeon known as X" which
   frequents the Mary's garden, since a black-and-white cat stalks the
   pigeon and eventually catches it. (The painting, as seen on the Faber
   dustjacket, is also referenced on the cover of the 1969 Sphere Books
   paperback edition. This depicts three bubbles, each containing the
   central detail of the painting, receding in perspective, as they
   apparently drift through thick clouds.) The Faber version of the
   painting with the book exists in another world where a woman known as
   the Wandering Virgin is in a trance-like state. She is reciting events
   in the worlds of G, S and C, Domoladossa, and the men in New York to a
   jury of ten men, whose members include the Suppressor of the Archives,
   the Impaler of Distortions, the Impersonator of Sorrows, the Image
   Motivator and the Squire of Reason. The book is thought to indicate the
   mental state of the girl in the painting, but the Virgin's recital
   becomes confused and the jury cannot decide whether the worlds she is
   describing are real or imaginary. The novel ends with the suggestion
   that the painting is a window on another world where time stands still.
   However, there is also a world in which both versions of the painting
   exist - in Manchester Art Gallery and on Faber's dust jacket - and
   readers of the novel who are, in effect, 'watching the watchers' may be
   left with the feeling that perhaps they too are being watched in other
   parallel universes.
