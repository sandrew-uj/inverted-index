   Chasm City is framed and largely written in the voice of Tanner
   Mirabel, a security expert who has come to Chasm City to avenge the
   death of his former client's wife at the hands of a "postmortal" noble
   named Argent Reivich.

   Tanner arrives to find that Yellowstone, the most advanced civilization
   in human history, has descended into squalor; an alien nanotech virus
   known as the Melding Plague has wreaked havoc throughout the system.
   Chasm City, a dense forest of mile-high shapeshifting skyscrapers, has
   melted into a slum. The Glitter Band, a sparkling diorama of ten
   thousand orbital habitats, has been reduced to a "Rust Belt" of a few
   hundred survivors, mostly primitive and pre-nanotech antiques.

   In this chaos of plague and desolation, Tanner seeks his prey, only to
   discover that Reivich is more clever than he originally thought. In the
   midst of his hunt, he begins experiencing virus-induced flashbacks from
   the life of Sky Haussmann, the founder of his home world, Sky's Edge,
   who is both revered and reviled for the crimes he committed for his
   people.

   From the depths of the gas plume at the heart of Chasm City, to the
   aristocratic canopy spanning what remains of the skyscrapers, Mirabel
   begins to unravel the mystery of the Melding Plague.
