   The last four gnomes in Great Britain live beside Folly Brook in
   Warwickshire; they are named after the flowers Baldmoney, Sneezewort,
   Dodder and Cloudberry. After Cloudberry goes exploring one day and does
   not return, the others make the tremendous decision to build a boat,
   the Dragonfly, and set out to find him. This is the story of the
   gnomes' epic journey, set against the background of the English
   countryside, beginning in spring, continuing through summer, and
   concluding in autumn, when the first frosts are starting to arrive.^[6]
