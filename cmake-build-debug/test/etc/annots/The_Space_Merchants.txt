   In a vastly overpopulated world, businesses have taken the place of
   governments and now hold political power. States exist merely to ensure
   the survival of huge trans-national corporations. Advertising has
   become hugely aggressive and by far the best-paid profession. Through
   advertising, the public is constantly deluded into thinking that the
   quality of life is improved by all the products placed on the market.
   Some of the products contain addictive substances designed to make
   consumers dependent on them. However, the most basic elements of life
   are incredibly scarce, including water and fuel. Personal transport may
   be pedal powered, with rickshaw rides being considered a luxury. The
   planet Venus has just been visited and judged fit for human settlement,
   despite its inhospitable surface and climate; the colonists would have
   to endure a harsh climate for many generations until the planet could
   be terraformed.

   The protagonist, Mitch Courtenay, is a star-class copywriter in the
   Fowler Schocken advertising agency who has been assigned the ad
   campaign which would attract colonists to Venus. But a lot more is
   happening than he knows about. It soon becomes a tale of mystery and
   intrigue, in which many of the characters are not what they seem, and
   Mitch's loyalties and opinions change drastically over the course of
   the narrative. One of the hazards he faces is a psychopathic agent of
   his former company, found using the same psychological techniques used
   to identify targets for advertising.

   Mitch goes to a resort in Antarctica, only to become lost outside in a
   blizzard. He recovers to find that he has been shanghaied as an
   ordinary working stiff. His ID number tattooed on his arm has been
   altered so he cannot reclaim his old identity. However his skills
   remain intact. He becomes the propaganda specialist for a cadre of
   revolutionaries, in the process becoming a convert to the cause of
   those he once manipulated as mere consumers. In the end he confronts
   those who stole his life, who are not necessarily his enemies, and
   those from his old life, who are not necessarily his friends.
