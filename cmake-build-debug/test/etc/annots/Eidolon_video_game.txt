   Eidolon takes place in approximately the year 2400, according to the
   game's website. The setting is a compressed and simplified
   representation of Western Washington, including the Puget Sound region
   and the Olympic Peninsula; the Kitsap Peninsula was added by a patch
   after release. Victoria, British Columbia is also accessible via a
   road bridge from Port Angeles. The player begins in a forest between
   Bellevue and Olympia. Gradual exploration reveals that the region
   is deserted and has largely reverted to wilderness, with its former
   cities reduced to overgrown ruins. Much of Seattle is underwater, while
   the other major cities are ringed by massive walls and littered with
   human skeletons.

   The background to this desolation is revealed through documents and
   images that the player may collect in any order. It becomes clear that
   events were set in motion by the development of technology that
   increased human longevity. When an earthquake in 2031 flooded Seattle,
   it exposed deposits of a new mineral that was used to construct
   towering "Beacons" in cities around the world. Humans were nearly
   immortal while within range of a Beacon, but their biological
   dependence on the technology left them at risk of fatal withdrawal
   symptoms outside the cities. Responding to the massive movements of
   population and tension between supporters and opponents of the Beacons,
   many cities constructed walls, isolating themselves from each other and
   the rural population that continued to experience natural lifespans.
   This period also saw the rise to prominence of the Sennin, people with
   heritable mutations that granted innate immortality and superhuman
   abilities.

   Growing conflicts and social breakdown culminated in "the Fall", a
   period around 2110 in which the destruction of Beacons by extremists
   left city-dwellers to die or flee to surviving cities, themselves
   diminishing in number and hostile towards refugees. Bellevue and
   Olympia fell at this time, while Victoria survived as a secluded police
   state for several decades longer. By the period in which the game is
   set, the rural communities in Western Washington that survived the Fall
   have disintegrated. In one series of letters, a Sennin named Triya
   reveals that she came to Washington long after the Fall in search of a
   cure for Beacon dependence for the world's few remaining cities; she
   eventually found this in Victoria, but its effectiveness is unknown.
