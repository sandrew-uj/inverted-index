   In 2617AD, the remains of Mitikas Imperium's naval forces are making a
   last stand against an unstoppable enemy force known only as the
   Pandorans who have driven them to the brink of destruction. A pilot by
   the name of Jacques Chalmers witnesses the final destruction of their
   forces at the hands of Admiral Zackaria before his own death.

   The story moves to Earth, on the other side of the galaxy, where Simon
   Dodds is awoken by a man named Patrick Dean who has mysteriously found
   his way to his parents' house. Though Dodds attempts to save his life,
   the man has suffered fatal gunshot wounds and dies of respiratory
   failure. The Confederation Stellar Navy arrive the next morning to take
   Dean's body away, telling Dodds to deny his existence. Two weeks later
   they request he return to naval service.

   Meeting Admiral Turner, Commodore Parks and Commodore Hawke, Dodds is
   once again reminded to deny Dean's existence and is then told that he
   is to spend the next 3 weeks participating in the ATAF project, a newly
   developed starfighter with superior capabilities to anything else in
   military history. Dodds is reunited with his old teammates (the White
   Knights), discovering during his absence that the Confederacy's
   flagship, a battleship known as Dragon, has been hijacked and has not
   been seen for nearly 6 months. Commodore Hawke was the only surviving
   crew member. He has, however, been unable to accurately describe what
   happened to him during that time.

   Whilst attending a presentation on the ATAF, Dodds begins to question
   the starfighter the navy has constructed, feeling the design is not an
   evolutionary step, but more of a reaction to something more serious.
   His teammates, however, dismiss his concern. The White Knights spend
   several weeks participating in simulated tests involving the ATAFs,
   bidding to become the real test pilots. They are, however, outperformed
   by another team (The Red Devils) and are transferred to the Confederacy
   border system of Temper, stationed at a planet called Spirit.

   Whilst patrolling the system, the group witness a research vessel come
   under attack by a raiding party. A single raider escapes with a dump of
   the vessel's databanks and flees into Imperial space. Later, whilst
   drinking in the naval base's Officer's Club, Dodds hears a series of
   rumours that explain that the purported Imperial civil war is a
   fabrication and the empire was wiped out months ago. The rumourmonger
   tells him that all that is left are a number of refugees and that
   Dragon, with its 50,000 strong crew, couldn't have been hijacked by
   anything more than a sizeable opponent. Dodds, Enrique and Chaz discuss
   the rumours and continue to drink neat whiskey for most of the night,
   becoming more and more drunk as the evening goes on. The next day the
   naval base is awoken to the news that Dragon has been located and the
   CSN plan to intercept and take back the vessel. A secondary goal of the
   operation is to also capture and arrest Admiral Zackaria, for his
   believed part in the ongoing trouble in Imperial space and the theft of
   the battleship. Although they are at first assigned to take part in the
   offensive run against enemy targets, the White Knights are relegated to
   secondary defence after Commodore Parks discovers that Dodds and
   Enrique are still drunk.

   The CSN sends its three major carriers, Griffin, Ifrit and Leviathan to
   Aster to intercept and bring Dragon home, commanded by Commodore Parks,
   Commodore Hawke, and Captain Meyers respectively. The start of the
   operation is disastrous, with Dragon's operators luring the allied
   forces into a false sense of security by complying with a remote
   shutdown request and then eliminating all the approaching vessels. It
   then turns its main cannon on UNF Grendel, destroying it with a single
   shot. With the allied forces completely outmatched by the enemy
   starfighter pilots, who many begin to believe are not being piloted by
   Imperials, Parks orders an immediate retreat. Before they can do so,
   however, they are attacked by enemy reinforcements and Griffin is left
   dead in the water. With the original pilots dead and with no means to
   launch fighters, the White Knights are left to pilot the ATAFs and use
   them to drive back the enemy forces. Dodds once again begins to
   question the power of the starfighter, feeling that something is not
   right about it.

   After the enemy forces have fled the system, the allies attempt to
   return home. Griffin, however, suffers a mis-jump and becomes stranded
   in Imperial space. Whilst the carrier's crew affect repairs and await
   rescue, Admiral Turner contacts Parks and tells him that the raider who
   stole the ATAF plans is currently in the same star system attempting to
   sell them on. He orders Parks to send the White Knights to Arlos
   starport to meet a government agent (Clare Barber) who has been tasked
   with retrieving them.

   Arriving at the starport, Dodds comes to realise that the rumours he
   had heard the previous nights are, in fact, 100% true and the starport
   is full of refugees. After hours of searching the starport the team
   discovers that Barber is dead and they head to the starport's
   hospital's morgue to search her for the stolen data card. It transpires
   that the woman has swallowed the card, leaving the team with no choice
   but to cut her open to get it. As they do so, a detachment of Pandoran
   soldiers arrive at the starport and begin to slaughter the refugees.
   The Knights attempt to fight one of the soldiers who has come to the
   morgue, searching for survivors, but discover the man is not only
   exceptionally strong, but also possesses incredible healing abilities.
   The team eventually manage to defeat the soldier and then fight their
   way out of the starport, heading back to Griffin.

   Arriving in the vicinity of the carrier, they discover that it has come
   under attack by Commodore Hawke, who has turned control of CSN Ifrit
   over to Admiral Zackaria, in service of the Imperial Senate and "The
   Mission". The Knights once again fight back against the enemy forces,
   before Dodds attacks Ifrit directly and spaces Hawke and Zackaria.
   Following this, the enemy forces cease their attack on Griffin and
   leave.

   The Knights return home to a heroes' welcome, but are left with a great
   number of questions on their minds.
