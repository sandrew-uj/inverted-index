   Air is the story of a town's fashion expert Chung Mae, a smart but
   illiterate peasant woman in a small village in the fictional country of
   Karzistan (loosely based on the country of Kazakhstan), and her
   suddenly leading role in reaction to dramatic, worldwide experiments
   with a new information technology called Air. Air is information
   exchange, not unlike the Internet, that occurs in everyone's brain and
   is intended to connect the world. After a test of Air is imposed on
   Mae's unprepared mountain town, everyone and everything changes,
   especially Mae who was deeper into Air than any other person.
   Afterwards, Mae struggles to prepare her people for what is to come
   while learning all about the world outside her home.
