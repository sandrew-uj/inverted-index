   In the year 2027, after 18 years of total human infertility, war and
   global depression push society to the point of collapse as humanity
   faces extinction. The United Kingdom, one of the few remaining nations
   with a functioning government, is deluged by refugees fleeing from
   chaos in their own countries. In response to this mass influx, the UK
   has become a police state as the British Army arrests, imprisons or
   executes illegal immigrants.

   Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped
   by the Fishes, a militant immigrant rights group. They are led by
   Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after
   their son's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money
   to acquire transit papers for a young refugee, Kee. Theo obtains the
   papers from his cousin, a government minister who runs a
   state-sponsored collection of salvaged art. Theo agrees to escort Kee
   in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes member, drives
   Theo, Kee, and former midwife Miriam towards Canterbury. An armed gang
   ambushes them, and Julian is killed. Two police officers stop their
   car, but Luke kills them, and the group hides Julian's body before
   heading to a Fishes safehouse.

   Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only pregnant
   woman on Earth. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the Human Project, a
   secretive scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing humanity's
   infertility. However, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is voted as
   the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a
   discussion and learns that Julian's death was orchestrated by the
   Fishes so that Luke could become their leader; they intend to kill Theo
   and use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution.
   Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they steal a car, escaping to the
   secluded hideaway of Theo's aging friend Jasper Palmer, a former
   political cartoonist turned pot dealer.

   The group makes plans to board the Human Project ship, the Tomorrow,
   which will arrive offshore at Bexhill-on-Sea disguised as a fishing
   vessel. Jasper proposes having Syd, an immigration cop to whom he
   frequently sells drugs, smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees. The next
   day, when the Fishes discover Jasper's house, the group flees while
   Jasper stays behind to stall the Fishes. Luke shoots and kills Jasper
   as Theo watches from the woods. The group meets Syd at an abandoned
   school, and he helps them board a bus to Bexhill - an entire city
   converted into a refugee camp. When Kee experiences contractions at a
   checkpoint, Miriam distracts a guard by feigning religious mania and is
   taken away.

   Inside the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romani woman, Marichka, who
   provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd
   informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British
   military and the refugees, led by the Fishes. Having learned that they
   have a bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Theo
   kills him with Marichka's help, and they escape. The group heads to a
   hidden rowboat amidst the fighting, but the Fishes capture Kee and the
   baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment building under heavy fire; he
   confronts Luke, who is killed in an explosion, and escorts Kee and the
   baby out. Awed by the baby, the British soldiers and Fishes temporarily
   stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to the
   boat but chooses to stay behind as they depart.

   As British fighter jets conduct airstrikes on Bexhill, the trio row to
   the rendezvous point, and Theo reveals that he was shot and wounded by
   Luke. He teaches Kee how to burp her baby, and Kee tells Theo she will
   name her Dylan after Theo and Julian's lost son. Theo loses
   consciousness and presumably dies as the Tomorrow approaches.
