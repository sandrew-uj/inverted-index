   Gilbert Gosseyn wakes to find he is Gosseyn Three, in telepathic
   contact with Gosseyn Two. One of the spare bodies used in his
   reincarnation machinery was found and forced to life by the approach of
   an immense space fleet from another galaxy, manned by the primordial
   ancestors of man, gripped in an eon-long war with mutants equally old.
   The space-fleet is ruled by an unstable youngster who seems to possess
   many of the same powers, including a double-brain, as Gosseyn.

   Gosseyn must school the youth in Null-A sanity, save the Earth from a
   cabal of gangsters and businessmen who oppose the return of the Games
   Machine, discover the secret reasons behind the endless horrifying war,
   and stop the intrigues of Enro the Red to return to power.
