   Jim Dixon is a lecturer in medieval history at a red brick university
   in the English Midlands. He has made an unsure start and, towards the
   end of the academic year, is concerned about losing his probationary
   position in the department. In his attempt to be awarded a permanent
   post he tries to maintain a good relationship with his absent-minded
   head of department, Professor Welch. To establish his credentials he
   must also ensure the publication of his first scholarly article, but he
   eventually discovers that the editor to whom he submitted it has
   translated it into Italian and passed it off as his own.

   Dixon struggles with an on-again off-again "girlfriend", Margaret Peel,
   a fellow lecturer who is recovering from a suicide attempt in the wake
   of a broken relationship with another man. Margaret employs emotional
   blackmail to appeal to Dixon's sense of duty and pity while keeping him
   in an ambiguous and sexless limbo. While she is staying with Professor
   Welch, he holds a musical weekend that seems to offer an opportunity
   for Dixon to advance his standing among his colleagues. The attempt
   goes wrong, however, and the drunken Dixon drops a lighted cigarette on
   the bed, burning a hole in the sheets.

   During the same weekend Dixon meets Christine Callaghan, a young
   Londoner and the latest girlfriend of Professor Welch's son, Bertrand,
   an amateur painter whose affectedness particularly infuriates Dixon.
   After a bad start Dixon realises that he is attracted to Christine, who
   is far less pretentious than she initially appears.

   Dixon's growing closeness to Christine upsets Bertrand, who is using
   her to reach her well-connected Scottish uncle and get a job from him.
   Then Dixon rescues Christine from the university's annual dance after
   Bertrand treats her offhandedly, and takes her home in a taxi. The pair
   kiss and make a date for later, but Christine admits that she feels
   guilty about seeing Dixon behind Bertrand's back and about Dixon's
   supposed relationship with Margaret. The two decide not to see each
   other again, but when Bertrand calls on Dixon to "warn him off the
   grass" he cannot resist the temptation to quarrel with Bertrand, until
   they fight.

   The novel reaches its climax during Dixon's public lecture on "Merrie
   England". Having attempted to calm his nerves by drinking too much, he
   caps his uncertain performance by denouncing the university culture of
   arty pretentiousness and passes out. Welch lets Dixon know privately
   that his employment will not be extended, but Christine's uncle offers
   Dixon the coveted job of assisting him in London. Later Dixon meets
   Margaret's ex-boyfriend, who reveals that he had not been her fiance,
   as she had claimed. Comparing notes, the two realise that the suicide
   attempt was faked as a piece of neurotic emotional blackmail.

   Feeling free of Margaret at last, Dixon responds to Christine's phoned
   request to see her off as she leaves for London. There he learns from
   her that she is leaving Bertrand after being told that he was having an
   affair with the wife of one of Dixon's former colleagues. They decide
   to leave for London together, and then walk off arm in arm, outraging
   the Welches as they pass on the street.
