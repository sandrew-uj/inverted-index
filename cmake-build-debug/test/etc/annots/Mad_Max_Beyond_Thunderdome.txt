   In post-apocalyptic Australia, Max Rockatansky is crossing the desert
   in a camel-drawn V8 wagon when he is attacked by a Transavia PL-12
   Airtruk piloted by a man named Jedediah and his son. They steal his
   wagon and belongings, and Max continues on foot, following their trail
   to a survivor community named 'Bartertown'--which has rebuilt
   ramshackle vestiges of basic civilization, even electricity. Initially
   refused entry because he has nothing to trade, Max is brought before
   the founder and ruler of Bartertown, the ruthless Aunty Entity. She
   offers to resupply his vehicle and equipment if he completes a task for
   her.

   Aunty explains that Bartertown's electrical supply depends on a crude
   methane refinery powered by pig feces. The refinery is run by a dwarf
   called Master and his giant bodyguard Blaster. "Master-Blaster" holds
   an uneasy truce with Aunty for control of Bartertown; however, Master
   has begun to challenge Aunty's leadership. Aunty instructs Max to
   provoke a confrontation with Blaster. According to Bartertown law,
   conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death in a gladiatorial arena
   called Thunderdome. Max enters the subterranean Underworld refinery
   area to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict
   sentenced to work for slaughtering a pig to feed his family. Max finds
   his stolen vehicle in Master-Blaster's possession and is forced to
   disarm his own booby-trapped engine. Here he discovers that although
   Blaster is exceptionally strong, he is hypersensitive to high-pitched
   noises, which severely disorient and incapacitate him.

   Accusing Master of the theft of his vehicle, Max provokes him into
   demanding justice for the insult by entering Blaster into a Thunderdome
   duel with Max. Blaster dominates the duel until Max is able to use his
   bosun's whistle to gain the upper hand. Poised to kill Blaster, Max
   knocks his helmet off and is shocked to discover that Blaster has Down
   syndrome. Max refuses to kill a man with "the mind of a child" and
   confronts Aunty for deceiving him, thus exposing her plot. Master,
   previously unaware of this arrangement to kill Blaster, is furious and
   vows to shut down the refinery and, by extension, Bartertown. Aunty has
   Blaster killed, Master imprisoned, and Max exiled. He is bound on a
   horse and sent off in a random direction through the wasteland. When
   his mount perishes in a sinkhole, Max frees himself and presses on.

   Near death, Max is found by a desert dweller named Savannah Nix, who
   hauls him back to her home, "Planet Erf", a primitive community of
   children and teenagers who live in an oasis. The children, descended
   from survivors of a crashed Boeing 747, were left by their parents who
   went to find civilization. They believe Max to be the flight captain,
   G. L. Walker, with whom Max bears an uncanny resemblance, returned to
   fix the aeroplane and fly them to civilization. Max denies this and
   insists that they remain in the relative safety of the oasis, knowing
   that the only "civilization" within reach is Bartertown.

   Some of the children, led by Savannah, leave anyway, determined to find
   the prophesied "Tomorrow-morrow Land." Max stops them by force, but
   another tribe member, Scrooloose, sets them free during the night and
   leaves with them. Their leader, Slake M'Thirst, asks Max to go after
   them, and he agrees, taking a few of the children with him to help.
   They find Savannah's group in danger but are unable to save one of the
   children from a sinkhole. With no supplies left, they are forced to
   head for Bartertown.

   The group sneak in via an underground entrance, and, with Pig Killer's
   help, free Master and escape in a train-truck, destroying Bartertown's
   methane refinery in the process. Aunty leads the Imperial Guards in
   pursuit in their postmodern vehicles, catching up to the train. Max's
   group slows them down while Scrooloose hijacks one of the pursuing
   vehicles. The group comes across Jedediah and his son, and Max coerces
   Jedediah into helping his group escape with their aeroplane. Max uses
   his vehicle to clear a path through Aunty's men, allowing the aeroplane
   to take off and escape, leaving him at Aunty's mercy. Aunty spares his
   life, having come to respect him, and departs to presumably make good
   on her vow to rebuild Bartertown.

   Jedediah flies the children to the coast, where they discover the
   nuclear-devastated ruins of Sydney. Years later, the children have
   established a small society of themselves and other lost wanderers in
   the ruins. Savannah, now leader of the group, recites a nightly story
   of their journey and the man who saved them, as Max, still alive in the
   desert, wanders on to places unknown.
