   The Pawns of Null-A is a 1956 science fiction novel by
   American-Canadian writer A. E. van Vogt, originally published as a
   four-part serial in Astounding Stories from October 1948 to January
   1949 as The Players of Null-A. It incorporates concepts from the
   General semantics of Alfred Korzybski and refers to non-Aristotelian
   logic. It was published in the UK with the original name.

   The novel is a continuation of the story of Gilbert Gosseyn from The
   World of Null-A, expanding on the galactic events which drove the
   interplanetary invasion of the earlier story.
