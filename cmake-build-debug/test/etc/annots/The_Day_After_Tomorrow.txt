   Jack Hall, an American paleoclimatologist, and his colleagues Frank and
   Jason, drill for ice-core samples in the Larsen Ice Shelf for the NOAA,
   when the ice shelf suddenly begins to split away. At a UN conference in
   New Delhi, Jack discusses his research showing that climate change
   could cause an ice age, but US Vice President Raymond Becker dismisses
   his concerns. Professor Terry Rapson, an oceanographer of the Hedland
   Centre in Scotland befriends Jack over his views of an inevitable
   climate shift. When several buoys in the Atlantic Ocean show a severe
   ocean temperature drop, Rapson concludes Jack's theories are correct.
   Jack's and Rapson's teams, along with NASA meteorologist Janet Tokada,
   build a forecast model based on Jack's research.

   A massive storm system develops in the northern hemisphere, splitting
   into three gigantic hurricane-like superstorms above Canada, Scotland,
   and Siberia. The storms pull frozen air from the upper troposphere into
   their center, flash-freezing anything caught in their eyes with
   temperatures below -150 degrees Fahrenheit (-101 degrees Celsius).
   Meanwhile, the weather worsens across the world: Tokyo is struck by a
   giant hail storm, Nova Scotia has a 25-foot (8-meter) storm surge in
   seconds, a three-helicopter special task force tasked with rescuing the
   British Royal family from Balmoral Castle crashes in Scotland after all
   their fuel lines freeze, and Los Angeles is devastated by a tornado
   outbreak. Following this, President Blake issues an executive order for
   the FAA to ground all air traffic across the country.

   In New York City, Jack's son Sam, and his friends Brian Parks and Laura
   Chapman participate in an academic decathlon, where they meet a new
   friend JD. New York is soon caught in the North American storm and the
   weather becomes progressively more violent, resulting in street
   flooding, and eventually a massive tsunami-like storm surge inundating
   Manhattan. This forces Sam's group to seek shelter at the New York
   Public Library, but not before Laura accidentally cuts her leg. While
   cellphone communications are down, Sam is able to contact Jack and his
   mother Lucy, a physician, through a working payphone; Jack advises him
   to stay inside and promises to rescue him. Rapson and his team perish
   in the European storm, while Lucy remains in a hospital caring for
   bed-ridden children, where she and her patients are eventually rescued
   by the authorities.

   Upon Jack's suggestion, Blake orders the southern states to be
   evacuated into Mexico; the northern half are doomed to be hit by the
   superstorm but are warned by the government to seek shelters and stay
   warm. With the storm having reached Washington, Blake perishes after
   his motorcade is caught in it, making Becker the new President. Jack,
   Jason, and Frank make their way to New York against all odds. In
   Pennsylvania, Frank falls through the skylight of a mall that had
   become covered in snow, and sacrifices himself by cutting his rope to
   prevent his friends from falling in after him. In the library, most
   survivors, as well as those from other structures, decide to head south
   once the floodwater outside freezes in spite of Sam's warnings, and are
   later found fatally frozen by Jack and Jason; only a few survivors end
   up taking heed of Sam's advice to stay put, burning books to stay warm
   as the temperatures plunge.

   Laura develops blood poisoning from her injury, whereupon Sam, Brian,
   and JD scour a Russian cargo vessel that had drifted into the city for
   penicillin, fending off a pack of wolves which had escaped from Central
   Park Zoo. The eye of the North American storm arrives, freezing
   Manhattan solid, but Sam's group make it inside just in time. Likewise,
   Jack and Jason take shelter in an abandoned restaurant. Days later, the
   superstorms dissipate and Jack and Jason successfully reach the
   library, finding Sam's group alive.

   Becker, in his first address as president from the US embassy in
   Mexico, apologizes on The Weather Channel for his ignorance and vows to
   send helicopters to rescue survivors in the northern states. Jack and
   Sam's group are picked up in Manhattan, where many people have
   survived. On the International Space Station, astronauts look down in
   awe at Earth's transformed surface, now with ice sheets extending
   across the northern hemisphere.
