   Homeworld 2 continues the struggle of the Hiigarans and their leader
   Karan S'jet. While in the original game the player could select either
   the Kushan or Taiidan races, in the sequel the Kushan are established
   as the canonical protagonists.

   During the events of the original game (and played out in the prequel
   Deserts of Kharak), the Kushan race of the planet Kharak discovered the
   wreckage of the Khar-Toba, an interstellar transport starship, in the
   Great Desert. Inside, they found an ancient Hyperspace Core, and a
   galactic map etched on a piece of stone that showed that the Kushan had
   been transplanted to Kharak long ago, and pointed the way to their
   long-lost homeworld, Hiigara. The Kushan built an enormous
   self-sufficient Mothership, powered by the Hyperspace Core from the
   Khar-Toba, to carry 600,000 people across the galaxy to Hiigara.
   Throughout their journey, the Kushan battled the forces of the Taiidan
   Empire, which had exiled them, and endured numerous other hardships
   along the way. With the aid of the Bentusi, a powerful and enigmatic
   race of traders, the Kushan reached Hiigara and destroyed the Taiidan
   Emperor, laying claim to their homeworld.

   The story continues that the Hyperspace Core found in the Khar-Toba was
   the second of only three known to exist in the galaxy, left behind by
   an ancient race known as the Progenitors. The First Core was possessed
   by the Bentusi; the third was lost until approximately one hundred
   years after the Exiles reclaimed Hiigara, found by a Vaygr Warlord
   named Makaan. With his massive Flagship empowered by the Third Core,
   Makaan began a campaign of conquest, seizing control of the remnants of
   the Taiidan Empire and surrounding star systems, and--as of the
   beginning of Homeworld 2--began attempts to capture Hiigara. The story
   states that religious beings of the galaxy consider the discovery of
   the Third Core to announce the End Times, during which Sajuuk, thought
   to be an immensely powerful being, will return. Makaan believes himself
   to be the Sajuuk-Khar, a messianic figure that will unite the Three
   Cores and herald the return of Sajuuk.

   The game begins with the commissioning of a new Mothership, the Pride
   of Hiigara, at the Great Derelict at Tanis. The Pride of Hiigara is
   similar in shape and design to the original Mothership and commanded by
   Karan S'jet, as in the original game. The ship is attacked by the Vaygr
   during the final stages of construction, but escapes to rally the
   Hiigaran fleet. Makaan's fleet lays siege to Hiigara, and the Warlord
   offers a deal to the Hiigarans: if they surrender the Second Core to
   him, he will spare their Homeworld.

   The Bentusi inform the Hiigarans that they must find Balcora Gate, left
   behind by the Progenitors, behind which is something essential for
   stopping either the Vaygr threat, the End Times, or both. The Hiigarans
   find a Progenitor Dreadnought in the wreckage of a massive vessel, and
   find that it is required to unlock Balcora Gate. The Great Harbor Ship
   of Bentus, last of the Bentusi, sacrifices itself after being ambushed
   in a Progenitor AI attack, leaving its Core for the Hiigarans to claim
   in order to stop Makaan. But the Warlord learns of the Balcora Gate as
   well, and the game's penultimate mission takes place on the other side,
   where Hiigarans and Vaygr alike discover that Sajuuk is in fact a
   Mothership-sized Progenitor starship, with sockets for the Three
   Hyperspace Cores.

   The Hiigaran fleet engages Makaan's Flagship and destroys it, claiming
   the Third Core from the wreckage. With all three Cores, the Hiigarans
   reactivate Sajuuk, abandoning the Pride of Hiigara, and bring it back
   to Hiigara to break the Vaygr siege, destroying the Vaygr's
   planet-killer weapons and saving Hiigara from destruction. Sajuuk is
   later found to be the key to a galaxy-wide network of hyperspace gates,
   ushering in a new age of trade and prosperity for all civilized races
   in the galaxy - the Age of Karan S'jet, the true Sajuuk-Khar.
