   On a camping trip in the Sierra Nevada mountains in central California,
   Steven Anders and his two teenage children, Deborah and David, are
   exploring a cave when they experience an earthquake. After emerging,
   they hear from a ranch-hand who was outside that there was a bright
   solar flash prior to the earthquake. He soon falls ill and dies,
   whereupon his body turns to a powdery substance. As the family comes
   down from the mountain to the nearest town, they discover that everyone
   has turned to the powdery substance inside their clothing, and there
   are few survivors.

   Owing to fear and anxiety, most people they find are focused only on
   their own survival, but as the family tries to make their way home to
   Malibu (where the mother had returned earlier from the camping trip),
   they find two people that need their help, as well as a man who invites
   them to be neighbors.

   They face dangers ranging from wild dogs, who seem to have been driven
   mad from the solar flare, to a gunman who steals their car. They rescue
   a woman, Jenny, and later a young boy whose family was killed by two
   men who stole their car. Apart from the physical journey, they struggle
   to overcome the emotional trauma of the events.

   They find their way home and discover a note left for them by the
   mother, who has also died and turned into a powdery substance. They are
   informed that a virus outbreak that began after the solar flare is
   responsible for most of the deaths, and that some people have a genetic
   resistance. Despairing, Jenny tries to commit suicide by drowning
   herself in the ocean, but she is rescued. At the conclusion, they exude
   a hopeful outlook by embarking on a trek to northern California.
