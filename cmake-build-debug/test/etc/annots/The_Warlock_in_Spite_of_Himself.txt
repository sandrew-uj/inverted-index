   The novel centers around Rod Gallowglass, a SCENT agent, who stumbles
   across the planet Gramarye. Immediately upon landing he is thrust into
   a world of medieval people, witches and warlocks, and all manner of
   mythical creatures. Rod is aided by his faithful companion Fess, an
   epileptic robot. While gathering intelligence, Rod discovers the planet
   is in political turmoil, due to futurian influence on behalf of the
   PEST and VETO organizations who plan to corrupt the planet away from
   democracy, which Rod plans to bring to the planet, due to the planet's
   importance to the future of the DDT. The three main factions are the
   Monarchy led by Queen Catherine, the beggars led by Tuan Loguire, and
   the Noble Lords eventually led by Anselm Loguire.

   Unfortunately for Rod when going to an inn for the night he is attacked
   by Big Tom. Rod defeats him, almost too easily, and Big Tom becomes a
   squire for Rod. Shortly thereafter the "wee people", who saw him land,
   declare him a warlock and put him to a test to determine if he is good
   or evil by forcing him to fight a werewolf. Upon defeating it, with
   garlic sausage, he is returned to the inn he was staying at. The next
   day Rod and Tom head to Catherine's castle to get themselves positions
   as soldiers. To do this however Rod is caught up in a fight with Brom
   O'Berin, a dwarf who is advisor to the Queen. Though defeated, Rod is
   permitted to join the Queen under the promise to solve the mystery of
   the Banshee which is continuously spotted upon the castle battlements.
   Rod discovers it is a hologram machine set upon the castle roof; he
   quickly disables it and is sent out for his next mission.

   Rod is then sent to gain intelligence on the Lords who have assembled
   at the fortress of Duke Loguire. On his way to the fortress Rod
   encounters a witch of his own age named Gwendylon. Gwen and Rod fall in
   love but Big Tom tells Rod he should stay away from her. Passing
   themselves off as minstrels, Rod and Big Tom gain entrance to the
   fortress and find the old Duke losing his grasp on the other lords. Rod
   discovers each lord has a new advisor, who are all PEST agents. Rod
   seeks more answers by exploring the haunted areas of the fortress,
   where he encounters ghosts. Thanks to Fess the ghosts give up trying to
   stop Rod and allow him free access. Rod discovers a passageway behind
   the Duke's seat in the great hall, which he later uses to save the Duke
   when the lords turn on him. However the ghosts discover that Gwen had
   followed Rod and return her to him. Upon saving the Duke, who is then
   replaced by his son Anselm, they make their escape into the forest and
   back to the Queen's castle. However, not having the full story, the
   Queen imprisons the old Duke Loguire for high treason and attempts to
   imprison Rod and Tom for aiding him until Brom comes to their aid and
   Cathrine lets them free.

   Events soon take a turn for the worst when Rod finds himself betrayed
   by Big Tom, who is revealed to be a VETO agent from the future. Rod is
   imprisoned in a local inn VETO is headquartered at, called the House of
   Clovis, with some very unlikely cell mates. Tuan Loguire had been
   betrayed by the VETO leader in the House named the Mocker, and Big Tom,
   having had second thoughts about betraying Rod, was also thrown in
   jail. While in jail the Mocker's plan is unveiled that he, with his
   lieutenants armed with futuristic guns, would throw the country into
   anarchy. In an escape plan Rod contacts Fess for help who in turn calls
   for Gwen who had been hiding with Fess. Gwen calls the elves for help
   who in turn send the Prince of Elves to break Rod out. To Rod's
   surprise the Prince of Elves turns out to be Brom O'Bernin. Rod, Brom,
   Tuan, and Tom return to the castle to form a plan to overthrow the
   Mocker. Though at the castle tensions are high between Tuan and
   Catherine.

   Rod, Tom and Tuan return to the House of Clovis with their plan to kill
   the Mocker. They succeed and the beggars are united under Queen
   Catherine. With their new forces assembled Catherine's forces march out
   to confront the Lords. A great battle ensues but Rod notices the
   advisors, led by Durer (Anselm's advisor), are building a large weapon
   to quickly decimate the Royal army. However the advisors are wielding
   energy swords and Big Tom, in an attempt to kill Durer, is killed. Rod,
   having witnessed Tom's death, rides with haste wielding a blaster from
   Fess's saddle and kills Durer.

   After the battle, with Rod's intervention, Tuan and Catherine are
   married. Rod sent a message to SCENT stating that he was quitting to
   stay on Gramarye with Gwen, but quickly receives a message back
   requesting he stay on as the permanent SCENT agent of Gramarye. He
   immediately proposes to Gwen but she refuses to let him kiss her until
   he admits he is a warlock, and Rod then for the first time states that
   he IS a warlock.
