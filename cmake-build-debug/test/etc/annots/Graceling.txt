   Graceling takes place in a world where Gracelings, or people with a
   "Grace" or special powers, are identified as children because their
   eyes are two different colors and are put in the service of the king.
   Katsa is a young woman known for her Grace of killing. Katsa has been
   in the service of her uncle, King Randa, since she was a child, tasked
   with executing or torturing those who oppose or displease him. She also
   runs the secret "Council", which aims for justice in the Seven
   Kingdoms.

   A Council mission to save an old Lienid grandfather from a prison
   unearths a mystery and an unexpected Graced Lienid man whose fighting
   skills match Katsa's. She renders him unconscious but lets him live,
   despite the fact that he recognized her. He later arrives at King
   Randa's court, introduces himself as Prince Greening or "Po", and
   claims to be seeking his grandfather. Katsa fights Po, but later
   reveals that they have rescued his grandfather in secret. The two
   become friends as well as sparring partners, though Katsa feels
   betrayed when she discovers that Po's Grace is not fighting, but
   secretly a form of mind reading. When commanded to dole out an unfair
   punishment, Katsa defies King Randa and sets out with Po to find the
   true kidnappers of the old Lienid. The two determine that Katsa's Grace
   isn't killing, but survival.

   Katsa and Po follow the trail of the kidnappers, and Po's Grace reveals
   that the revered King Leck of Monsea has committed numerous crimes,
   though they simultaneously swear that Leck is innocent. Po decides that
   King Leck, who is one-eyed, must be secretly Graced with the power to
   make others believe his lies. Katsa and Po set out to rescue Po's Aunt
   Ashen and her daughter Bitterblue from King Leck. Katsa and Po find
   Leck, who kills Ashen as she flees. Katsa is overwhelmed by Leck's
   Graced power and they are forced to flee. Once alone, they are able to
   find Bitterblue hiding in the forest. Po confronts Leck, but is
   severely wounded and has to hide in the woods in Monsea, while Katsa
   and Bitterblue flee through a dangerous and inaccessible mountain pass.
   Katsa and Bitterblue survive the journey and get to a ship at the port
   of Suncliff. They convince the ship's captain that they are acting for
   Prince Po, and make for Po's castle.

   At Po's castle, Katsa is shocked to find King Leck has taken over, and
   is nearly overwhelmed by his Grace. Only Katsa's love for Po enables
   her to kill Leck when he is about to reveal Po's secret Grace. With
   Leck dead, his stories are exposed as lies and Katsa and Bitterblue
   return to Monsea with Bitterblue as queen. They find Po in the woods,
   but Katsa discovers that Po is blind due to his wounds. Nevertheless,
   his Grace allows him to sense his surroundings, and he is able to
   convince the others that he can see. Katsa and Po renew their
   relationship, and Katsa takes on a mission to teach the girls and women
   of the seven kingdoms to defend themselves. The lovers promise to
   reunite in a few months at Po's castle.
