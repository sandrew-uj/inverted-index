   Set in present-day Toronto, Ontario, the novel is about three women and
   their history with old friend and nemesis, Zenia. Roz, Charis, and Tony
   meet once a month in a restaurant to share a meal decades after Zenia
   betrayed them and interferes with their romantic relationships. During
   one outing they spot Zenia, who they thought to be long-dead since
   their university days. The plot then travels back in time to explain
   how Zenia stole, one by one, their respective partners. The novel
   alternates between the present and the past through flashbacks, in the
   third person perspective of Tony, Charis and Roz. Zenia gives each
   woman a different version of her biography, tailor-made to insinuate
   herself into their lives. No one version of Zenia is the truth, and the
   reader knows no more than the characters.

   Their betrayals by Zenia are what initially bring the three together as
   friends and bind their lives together irrevocably - their monthly
   luncheons begin after her funeral.

   In the present-day, Roz, Charis and Tony each individually confront
   Zenia in a Toronto hotel room, where she tells each of them that the
   men they'd been with got what they deserved. She explains various
   versions of her earlier staged death, each as implausible as the
   accounts of her life.
