   An alien starship has entered the solar system sometime in the Sixth
   Century of the Thirteenth Millennium A. D. The ship appears to belong
   to the Riss, an alien race who had come to Sol millennia ago and
   destroyed the thriving human civilization. Now the descendants of the
   survivors, living in a medieval society with spaceships, must face the
   threat again. One of those is Jerrin, Lord Advisor of the Linnan
   Empire. Jerrin is annoyed that his brother, the mutant atom priest
   Clane, knew about the Riss incursion before he did and is more annoyed
   when Clane recommends an attack on the Riss ship, one that is
   guaranteed to fail.

   The attack does indeed fail, but Clane, Jerrin, and their associates
   are protected by a glassy-looking aetherial sphere that Clane controls
   mentally and that absorbs energy. For his second attack Clane sneaks
   aboard the Riss ship and uses the sphere to eliminate the crew. Taking
   over the ship, Clane flies it to his estate. There he discovers that
   Jerrin has been assassinated, poisoned by his wife Lilidel, who was
   concerned that her son Calaj was to be disinherited from the Lord
   Advisorship. Worse, Clane discovers that his magic sphere has been
   stolen by followers of Czinczar, a barbarian from Europa who recently
   tried to conquer the Empire of Linn.

   Calaj becomes Lord Advisor and Clane convinces him to sign a document,
   which he does without reading it. Lilidel is incensed: though the
   document appears to strengthen Calaj, she is suspicious, especially
   knowing that Clane has disappeared. Then the Riss arrive.

   Clane has taken part of his army along with Czinczar and his army
   aboard the captured Riss ship, which he has renamed Solar Star, and has
   headed out on a one-year journey to a star sixty-five light-years from
   Sol. On arrival they discover two Earth-like planets revolving about
   their common center of mass as they go around their sun. The planets
   are occupied by humans, but Clane and his crew are shocked to discover
   that those people can teleport themselves and other things at will and
   that they have a peaceful trading relationship with the Riss. During
   the visit Clane and his crew engage and destroy a Riss battleship.
   Then, using star maps retrieved from the wreckage, Clane takes the
   Solar Star on a three-month voyage to a Riss solar system.

   Clane and his army establish a bridgehead on the Riss planet and fend
   off a Riss attack. After the attack the Terrans discover humans living
   in vast artificial caverns and Clane discovers that they have another
   aetherial sphere, which he controls with his thoughts. Taking the
   sphere with them, Clane and his men reboard the Solar Star and return
   to Earth.

   Clane quickly re-establishes himself on Earth and takes over the
   government, using the document that Calaj so carelessly signed. He
   sends Lilidel and Calaj into exile and then employs the aetherial
   sphere in a new way to defeat the Riss.
