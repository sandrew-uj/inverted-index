   9th Grader Jack Perdu lives with his father on the Yale campus. After
   Jack encounters a near fatal accident when he got hit by a car one
   winter night, his father sends him to New York City to visit a
   mysterious doctor (Dr. Lyons) who specializes in death. After an
   unusually brief meeting with Dr. Lyons, Jack returns to Grand Central
   Station to catch a train back home. He decides that it would be a shame
   to leave NYC without sightseeing first and squeezes himself into a
   nearby tour group by some pillars. While the group moves on with the
   tour, Jack stays behind and meets a girl named Euri. She offers to give
   him a tour of Grand Central Station and take him to places only 'True
   Urban Explorers' would know of.

   Euri shows him a secret door on the sixth track which leads to a bunch
   of stairs. 9 floors down, Jack discovers the New York Underworld. A
   place where the dead gather to solve their problems before they move on
   to Elysium. Jack and Euri are chased by two security guards and their
   big three headed dog Cerberus. Euri pulls Jack into a corner to hide
   and confesses that she is actually a ghost and she wants to live again.
   Jack promises Euri that he will help her escape to the human world. He
   tells Euri about his mother and Euri promises to help him find her.

   In the end, Jack meets his mother and helps her move on. He tries to
   bring Euri back to the Human World but fails in doing so. Jack and his
   father move back to NYC, Jack starts school there, and he becomes
   friends with a girl in his Latin Class. He temporarily loses his
   ability to see ghosts but soon regains it when he sees Euri sitting on
   a windowsill, watching him. He tries to apologize to her for not being
   able to bring her back with him but she puts her finger on her lips,
   indicating that she already knows what he's going to say.
