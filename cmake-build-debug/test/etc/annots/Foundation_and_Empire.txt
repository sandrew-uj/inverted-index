   Foundation and Empire is a science fiction novel by American writer
   Isaac Asimov originally published by Gnome Press in 1952. It is the
   second book in the Foundation Series, and the fourth in the in-universe
   chronology. It takes place in two parts, originally published as
   separate novellas. The second part, "The Mule", won a Retro Hugo Award
   in 1996.

   Foundation and Empire saw multiple publications--it also appeared in
   1955 as Ace Double (but not actually paired with another book) D-125
   under the title The Man Who Upset the Universe. The stories comprising
   this volume were originally published in Astounding Magazine (with
   different titles) in 1945. Foundation and Empire was the second book in
   the Foundation trilogy. Decades later, Asimov wrote two further sequel
   novels and two prequels. Later writers have added authorized, and
   unauthorized, tales to the series.
