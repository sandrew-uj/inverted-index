   Richard Papen leaves his hometown of Plano, California, for the elite
   Hampden College in Vermont to study Ancient Greek. Though Richard is
   accepted by most of his peers, he finds he cannot enroll into the
   classes of Classics professor Julian Morrow, who limits enrollment to a
   hand-picked clique of five students: charming but secretive fraternal
   twins Charles and Camilla Macaulay; Francis Abernathy, a homosexual
   whose secluded country home becomes a sanctuary for the group; Henry
   Winter, an intellectual prodigy with a passion for the Pali canon,
   Homer, and Plato; and Edmund "Bunny" Corcoran, a broke and bigoted
   jokester who takes advantage of his friends. After Richard helps the
   students with their homework, they give him advice on endearing himself
   to Julian. Eventually Richard is accepted both into Julian's classes
   and the friendship circle.

   Henry seems to have a strained friendship with Bunny, but they spend
   winter break together in Rome while Richard takes a low-paying campus
   job and spends winter break in an unheated warehouse. He nearly dies
   from hypothermia and pneumonia but is rescued and taken to the hospital
   by Henry, who returns early from Italy.

   After winter break, tensions between Bunny and the group worsen.
   Richard learns the chilling truth from Henry and Francis: during a
   bacchanal from which both Richard and Bunny were excluded, Henry
   accidentally killed a farmer near Francis's country estate. Bunny by
   chance reads a newspaper detailing the murder of the farmer in Vermont,
   where he is aware the bacchanal took place. Bunny has been blackmailing
   the group since he found out about the death of the farmer. No longer
   able to meet Bunny's demands, and fearing that he will expose them, the
   group resolves to kill Bunny. The students confront Bunny while he is
   hiking and Henry pushes him into a ravine to his death.

   The group struggles to maintain their cover, joining search parties for
   Bunny and even attending his funeral. Richard learns more about the
   bacchanal murder from Camilla. It turns out that when they killed the
   stranger in plaid, his stomach was cut open, suggesting that it was not
   accident at all.

   Shortly after Bunny's murder, Charles develops an alcohol problem and
   becomes abusive towards his sister, Camilla. Henry steps in and
   arranges for Camilla to move into a hotel to get away from Charles.
   Francis tells Richard the twins have sex with each other, and that he
   has had sex with Charles several times. Francis also admits that he
   suffers from panic attacks.

   Julian eventually comes to understand the group's culpability in
   Bunny's murder when he catches a glimpse of the logo of the hotel Bunny
   and Henry stayed at in Rome on a letter from Bunny imploring Julian to
   help him, which he had initially dismissed as being written by another
   student on the campus as part of a joke. Instead of reporting the crime
   to the authorities, Julian leaves the faculty at Hampden College and
   never returns.

   Henry begins living with Camilla, which drives Charles further into
   alcoholism. When Charles is arrested in a drunk-driving incident with
   Henry's car, Henry fears Charles will let slip their secret to the
   police, while Charles fears that Henry may kill him to keep his
   silence. After this incident, Charles barges into Camilla and Henry's
   hotel room and tries to kill Henry with Francis's gun. In the struggle,
   Charles accidentally shoots Richard in the abdomen. The innkeeper,
   hearing the commotion, forces his way into the room. To protect the
   rest of the group and keep their secrets hidden, Henry kisses Camilla
   farewell and shoots himself. The police report concludes that, in a
   suicidal fit, Henry inadvertently shot Richard.

   With Henry's death, the group disintegrates. Francis, living in Boston,
   attempts suicide and, though homosexual, is forced by his rich
   grandfather to marry a woman he despises. Camilla, caring for her
   grandmother, becomes increasingly isolated. Charles runs away from
   rehab to Texas with a married woman and no longer speaks to Camilla.
   Finally, Richard, after recovering from his wounds, becomes a lonely
   academic with an unrequited love for Camilla. Richard sees Henry's
   death as having cut the cord that bound them, setting them all adrift.
   He meets Henry in a dream, and asks him if he is happy there. Henry
   replies: "Not particularly. But you're not very happy where you are,
   either."
