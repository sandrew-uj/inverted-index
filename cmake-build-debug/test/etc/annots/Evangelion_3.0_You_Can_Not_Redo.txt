   Fourteen years after the worldwide cataclysm called the Third
   Impact, Asuka Langley Shikinami and Mari Illustrious Makinami,
   pilots of the Evangelion mecha, retrieve a container from Earth's orbit
   carrying Evangelion Unit 01 and its pilot Shinji Ikari. Before launch,
   Asuka wears her old plugsuit, convinced by Mari, attempting to get
   Shinji to recognize them. When Asuka grabs the container with her
   Evangelion unit, it releases attack drones. Unit 01 awakens and
   destroys the drones, then deactivates and descends back to Earth.
   Kaworu Nagisa watches and says he has been waiting for Shinji.

   Salvaged from Unit 01, Shinji is fitted with an explosive choker and
   sent to Captain Misato Katsuragi, who now leads WILLE, an organization
   intent on destroying her previous employer NERV, the paramilitary
   organization that deploys the Evangelion units. As more drones attack,
   Misato launches the flying battleship Wunder, powered by Unit 01, to
   destroy them. She warns that Shinji will be killed if he pilots any
   Evangelion units because of Third Impact, which has also kept the
   pilots from aging. The other occupant of Unit 01, Rei Ayanami, was
   never found.

   An Evangelion unit, Mark.09, intercepts the Wunder. Hearing Rei's
   voice, Shinji escapes with the unit. Rei takes him to the ruined NERV
   headquarters. Gendo Ikari, Shinji's father and NERV's leader, informs
   him that he is to pilot a new Evangelion, Unit 13, with Kaworu. Shinji
   befriends Kaworu as they practice piano duets together, but discovers
   that Rei is unable to remember anything and only follows orders. Kaworu
   shows Shinji the ruins of Tokyo 3, explaining that Shinji's awakening
   of Unit 01 caused Third Impact. He also reveals that Gendo plans to
   force humanity's evolution by triggering a mass extinction, removing
   humanity's individuality and reuniting with his deceased wife Yui
   Ayanami.

   Gendo's assistant Kozo Fuyutsuki invites Shinji to play shogi and
   reveals that Yui is within Unit 01 as the control system. Rei is one of
   several clones of Shinji's mother; the Rei who rescued him is only the
   latest. Shinji is distraught by this. Kaworu removes Shinji's choker
   and wears it to gain his trust.

   Shinji and Kaworu pilot Unit 13 on their mission to use the Spears of
   Cassius and Longinus, two ancient weapons, to undo Third Impact; Rei
   follows in Mark.09. When Unit 13 reaches the body of the alien lifeform
   Lilith, Kaworu realizes that the spears are not what he expected.
   Kaworu, Asuka and Mari try stopping Shinji, but Shinji removes the
   spears. On Gendo's orders, Mark.09 decapitates Mark.06 to release the
   Twelfth Angel, which is absorbed by Unit 13.

   The awakened Unit 13 rises into the sky, starting another cataclysm,
   the Fourth Impact. Kaworu reveals that as the First Angel, he is now
   "cast down" to the Thirteenth. Rei loses control of Mark.09, which
   boards Wunder on its own in an attempt to take control of the ship. Rei
   ejects from her unit and Asuka blows up her own unit to destroy
   Mark.09. To stop the Fourth Impact, Mari ejects Shinji's cockpit from
   Unit 13, while Kaworu stabs the unit with the spears and allows the
   choker to kill him, to Shinji's horror. Rescuing Shinji from the
   cockpit, Asuka lectures him on running away from his problems before
   dragging him through the remains of Tokyo-3, with Rei following.
