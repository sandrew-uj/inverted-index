   Commitment Hour is a science fiction novel by Canadian writer James
   Alan Gardner, published in 1998. The novel is set in Gardner's "League
   of Peoples's" futuristic universe, and plays out in the small, isolated
   village of Tober Cove. Set on post-apocalyptic Earth, Tober Cove most
   resembles a rural, seventeenth century fishing village, with one
   exception: every year, everyone below the age of 21 changes gender. At
   the age of twenty-one, the people of the village must "commit" to being
   male, female or both in the form of a Hermaphrodite (a 'Neut'),
   forever. Commitment Hour follows the day leading up to the main
   character's hour of commitment.

   Tober Cove's society revolves around gender. Dualistic in structure,
   there is a matriarch and a patriarch, both of whom command equal - but
   different - power within the community. The patriarch is the head of
   the city council and the military, which also serves as the town's
   police force. The matriarch runs the town's health services, a vital
   role in a society without modern medicine. Tasks within the community
   are largely gender determined: men are warriors, fishermen, carpenters
   etc. and women are seamstresses, craft-makers, food preparers etc.
   Thus, in Tober Cove, choosing a gender is akin to choosing a life.

   Throughout the book, the main character addresses some of the more
   obvious questions, and to him more silly questions people from outside
   the Cove ask. When asked 'which sex is better,' the main character
   explains that the answer varies from person to person. Of course, if
   being male was better, or vice versa, the population of Tober Cove
   would be overwhelmingly one sided. Since it wasn't, you could say that
   both sexes had equal advantages and disadvantages. Of course, making
   love to someone from Tober Cove was always better, since they knew what
   felt good for both sexes.

   Tober Cove's religion also revolves around gender. The residents
   believe that the gods granted the people of their town the special
   privilege of choosing their sex, and that every year the gods come to
   collect their children and change their genders. The fact that the
   "gods" that descended into the town's harbor every year are stylized
   planes doesn't bother the residents. They simply believed that the gods
   used many devices as their instruments.

   Tober Cove exists in a post-apocalyptic Earth. Earth is post
   apocalyptic in the sense that, when the "League of Peoples" offered
   humanity technological advance in exchange for the promise never to
   kill other sentient creatures, most of the population of Earth accepted
   and left the planet. Those who remained were those who wouldn't, or
   couldn't accept the League's offer. As Earth's population departed, the
   planet descended into chaos. The book takes place about 400 years after
   this great exodus, and while some technology still exists, most has
   fallen in ruin. Tober Cove is a small, rural, technologically
   undeveloped town that is unique in the galaxy.

   Spark Lords rule Earth with super-advanced technology. Clad in
   indestructible armor, with access to the galaxy's latest gadgetry,
   Spark Lords maintain absolute control over Earth. Charged by the League
   with maintaining law and order on Earth, they content themselves with
   preventing major conflicts. They generally stay out of local affairs,
   and, to the knowledge of Cove residents, no Spark Lord has ever visited
   Tober Cove. Much of the plot of the novel is driven by the arrival in
   Tober Cove of the Science Spark Lord to observe the gender-changing
   ceremony.
