   A group of elegant monster dogs in top hats, tails, and bustle skirts
   become instant celebrities when they come to New York in 2008. Refugees
   from a town whose residents had been utterly isolated for a hundred
   years, the dogs retain the nineteenth-century Germanic culture of the
   humans who created them. They are wealthy and glamorous and seem to
   lead charmed lives - but they find adjusting to the modern world
   difficult, and when a young woman, Cleo Pira, befriends them, she
   discovers that a strange, incurable illness threatens them all with
   extinction. When the dogs construct their dream home, a fantastic
   castle on the Lower East Side, and barricade themselves inside, Cleo
   finds herself one of the few human witnesses to a mad, lavish party
   that may prove to be the final act in the drama of the lives of the
   monster dogs.
