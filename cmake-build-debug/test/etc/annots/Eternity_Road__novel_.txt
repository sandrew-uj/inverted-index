   1,700 years after a deadly plague has wiped out the great civilisations
   of man, the survivors' descendants have built up a new, comparably
   primitive society. A group of explorers sets out on an expedition to
   find a legendary haven of knowledge and ancient wisdom, and in the
   process learn more about the people they only remember as "the
   Roadmakers".
