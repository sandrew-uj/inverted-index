   Fred Halpern, a young man with a gift for mentally calculating
   trajectories and orbits is expelled from the Goddard Space Academy a
   week before graduation due to his long history of insubordination and
   lack of discipline. Because of a foolish attempt to land on the Moon in
   a stolen rocket which caused him to be trapped and the subsequent death
   of one of his rescuers, he is ostracized by the space community. When
   given a final chance to show he has grown up, he questions his motives
   and wonders if he can escape his past.
