   Will Monroe's normal life is disrupted when his wife is kidnapped while
   he is reporting on a story of a militia man found dead in his isolated
   log cabin. Further investigation into the death brings Monroe to the
   conclusion that the dead militia man shared an attribute with a New
   York City pimp, also recently murdered. They were both described as
   being 'righteous'. As more murders of 'righteous men' happen across the
   globe, time seems to be running out for Will and the old and current
   friends he has enlisted. With a series of clues from a mysterious
   source, absurd twists and religious factors Will soon finds himself in
   the middle of a plot to bring about nothing less than Judgement Day.

   The book focuses on the fact that several people have been murdered in
   what can only be described as a humane way. What these victims have in
   common is that they have been described by folk who knew them as
   "righteous" (hence the title) although they led some mundane or
   unethical existence (i.e. pimps, drug barons or even call centre
   employees). Nothing seems to fit to connect the murders together. A
   rookie NY Times reporter is sent on a murder case (the pimp) and is
   then sent off to do a story in Seattle where he finds another victim
   here whilst trying to report on freak weather conditions. While he's
   away, his wife gets kidnapped by what turns out to be the Hassidic
   community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

   What these "Righteous Men" turn out to be are based on Jewish folklore:
   that the world rests on 36 men who perform righteous acts to others.
   They themselves may not know that they are one of 36 and will always
   lead a life so far removed from what they are about. But without these
   men - the world will not be spared by God. So while the killing of the
   real 36 continues, the world (according to this story) is in grave
   danger. The killings seem to be done in the name of God; but as it is a
   Jewish story, why would they want this to happen? It turns out that the
   killings are being done by a faction of the Christian Church (The
   Church of the Reborn Jesus) who hold the notion that the Jews have
   forfeited their role as the chosen people (replacement theology) and by
   killing the 36 should bring about the Second Coming (something the Jews
   do not believe).
