   Hiro Protagonist is a hacker and pizza delivery driver for the Mafia.
   He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier
   (courier) who refers to herself in the third person, during a failed
   attempt to make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his
   behalf and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it
   to the CIC, the for-profit organization that evolved from the CIA's
   merger with the Library of Congress. Within the Metaverse, Hiro is
   offered a datafile named Snow Crash by a man named Raven who hints that
   it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a
   bitmap image contained in the file which causes his computer to crash
   and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his
   ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a
   large amount of research compiled by her associate, Lagos. This
   research posits connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian
   culture, and the legend of the Tower of Babel. Juanita advises him to
   be careful and disappears.

   The Mafia boss Uncle Enzo begins to take a paternal interest in Y.T.
   Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and
   offers her freelance jobs. Hiro's investigations and Y.T.'s
   intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the
   neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend
   Wayne's Pearly Gates and a media magnate named L. Bob Rife beginning to
   emerge. Lagos's research showed that the ancient Sumerian ur-language
   allowed brain function to be 'programmed' using audio stimuli in
   conjunction with a DNA altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized
   around these programs (known as me) which were administered by priests
   to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus
   (known as the nam-shub of Enki) which when delivered stopped the
   Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and led to the
   development of other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel
   myth. L. Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed
   the drug Snow Crash in order to make the public vulnerable to new forms
   of me which he would control. The physical form of the virus is
   distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend
   Wayne's church via infected blood. There is also a digital version to
   which hackers are especially vulnerable as they are accustomed to
   processing information in binary form.

   Hiro heads north to where the Raft, a huge collection of boats
   containing Eurasian refugees, is approaching the American coast. The
   center of the Raft is L Bob Rife's yacht, formerly the USS Enterprise
   nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Rife has been using the Raft as a
   mechanism to indoctrinate and infect thousands with the virus and to
   import it to America. Y.T. is captured and brought to Rife on the Raft,
   who intends to use her as a hostage, knowing her connection to Uncle
   Enzo. With help from the Mafia, Hiro makes it onto the raft and
   recovers the nam-shub of Enki which Rife had been concealing. With help
   from Juanita who had previously infiltrated the Raft, the nam-shub is
   read out and Rife's control over the Raft is broken. Rife flees the
   Raft, taking Y.T., and Raven attempts to activate the digital form of
   Snow Crash at a virtual concert within the Metaverse. Hiro is able to
   neutralize the virus and Y.T. escapes. After a confrontation with the
   Mafia, Raven is injured, and Rife is killed as he attempts to flee on
   his private jet. Y.T. is reunited with her mother and Hiro and Juanita
   appear reconciled.
