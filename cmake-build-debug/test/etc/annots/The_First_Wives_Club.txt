   At Middlebury College in 1969, four young friends, Annie MacDuggan,
   Elise Elliot, Brenda Morelli, and Cynthia Swann, are graduating. As the
   graduates take a commemorative picture of the four of them (presumably
   for the last time), Cynthia makes Annie, Brenda and Elise promise that
   they will always be there for each other throughout the remainder of
   their lives.

   In the present time, the four friends have lost touch with one another,
   as evident when Cynthia is tearfully gazing at the picture of the four
   of them on that graduation day. Now wealthy and living in a luxurious
   penthouse, she has her maid mail letters to her friends. She later
   walks outside on the balcony of her penthouse and commits suicide by
   jumping to her death after learning through the tabloids that her
   ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections)
   married his much younger mistress the day before.

   Cynthia's suicide is subsequently splashed all over the news. The
   surviving three former friends, shocked by the tragic event, all attend
   her funeral. Afterward, the three friends reconnect over a long lunch
   to catch up on their lives post-graduation. As it turns out, Cynthia's
   former friends are not doing much better. Annie is separated, suffering
   extreme self-esteem issues, and undergoing therapy with her husband.
   Brenda is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling
   financially. Elise, whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is
   now an aging alcoholic film actress who has become a plastic-surgery
   addict to keep her career afloat.

   Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends
   are reunited for the first time since college, Annie's husband, Aaron,
   leaves her for their younger therapist and asks her for a divorce after
   spending a night together (and leading Annie to believe it would
   reconcile them); Brenda has an unpleasant encounter at a clothing store
   with her ex, Morty, and his airheaded younger mistress Shelly, and
   Elise discovers that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill, is requesting
   alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her
   fame to him. During a meeting with a director for a possible leading
   film role, Elise discovers that she is only to play the lead female's
   mother, before learning the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend.

   Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letters that Cynthia
   mailed to them before her suicide. After each one reads her letter from
   Cynthia, and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their
   husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to
   get restitutions from their exes. Annie's lesbian daughter Chris also
   joins the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency
   so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for
   Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.

   Brenda discovers through her uncle Carmine, who has Mafia connections,
   that Morty is guilty of income tax fraud, while Annie makes a plan to
   revive her advertising career and buy out Aaron's partners. Elise
   starts to liquidate all of the marital assets she and Bill collected
   during their marriage, agreeing to split the proceeds of the
   liquidation between the two of them. However, as their plan moves
   through, things start to fall apart when they discover that Bill has no
   checkered past and nothing for them to use against him. Elise, feeling
   sorry for herself, gets drunk, which only results in her and Brenda
   hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart. When
   Annie starts considering closing down the First Wives Club, her friends
   return, saying that they want to see this to the end, and Bill has not
   done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows. As a
   result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's
   mistress is actually a minor.

   Deciding that revenge would make them no better than their husbands,
   they instead use these situations to push their men into funding the
   establishment of a nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding abused
   women, in memory of Cynthia. The film ends with a celebration at the
   new Cynthia Swann Griffin Crisis Center for Women. Elise starts a
   relationship with a cast member in her play, Brenda and Morty
   reconcile, and Annie rebuffs Aaron's attempt at reconciliation. While
   outside the center, Bill meets Shelly and the two start to flirt. The
   film concludes with the three women joyfully singing "You Don't Own
   Me".
