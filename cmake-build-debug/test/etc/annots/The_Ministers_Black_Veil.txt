   The story begins with the sexton standing in front of the
   meeting-house, ringing the bell. He is to stop ringing the bell when
   the Reverend Mr. Hooper comes into sight. However, the congregation is
   met with an unusual sight: Mr. Hooper is wearing a black
   semi-transparent veil that obscures all of his face but his mouth and
   chin from view. This creates a stir among the townspeople, who begin to
   speculate about his veil and its significance. As he takes the pulpit,
   Mr. Hooper's sermon is on secret sin and is "tinged, rather more darkly
   than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper's temperament". This
   topic concerns the congregation who fear for their own secret sins as
   well as their minister's new appearance. After the sermon, a funeral is
   held for a young lady of the town who has died. Mr. Hooper stays for
   the funeral and continues to wear his now more appropriate veil. It is
   said that if the veil were to blow away, he might be "fearful of her
   glance". Mr. Hooper says a few prayers and the body is carried away.
   Two of the mourners say that they have had a fancy that "the minister
   and the maiden's spirit were walking hand in hand". That night another
   occasion arises, this time a joyous one--a wedding. However, Mr. Hooper
   arrives in his veil again, bringing the atmosphere of the wedding down
   to gloom.

   By the next day, even the local children are talking of the strange
   change that seems to have come over their minister. Yet, no one is able
   to ask Mr. Hooper directly about the veil, except for his fiancee
   Elizabeth. Elizabeth tries to be cheerful and have him take it off. He
   will not do so, even when they are alone together, nor will he tell her
   why he wears the veil. Eventually, she gives up and tells him goodbye,
   breaking off the engagement.

   The one positive benefit of the veil is that Mr. Hooper becomes a more
   efficient clergyman, gaining many converts who feel that they too are
   behind the black veil with him. Dying sinners call out for him alone.
   Mr. Hooper lives his life thus, though he is promoted to Father, until
   his death. According to the text, "All through life the black veil had
   hung between him and the world: it had separated him from cheerful
   brotherhood and woman's love, and kept him in that saddest of all
   prisons, his own heart; and still it lay upon his face, as if to deepen
   the gloom of his dark-some chamber, and shade him from the sunshine of
   eternity".

   Even though Elizabeth broke off their engagement, she never marries and
   still keeps track of the happenings of Hooper's life from afar. When
   she finds out that he is deathly ill she comes to his death bed to be
   by his side. Elizabeth and the Reverend ask him once again to remove
   the veil, but he refuses. As he dies, those around him tremble. He
   tells them in anger not to tremble, not merely for him but for
   themselves, for they all wear black veils. Father Hooper is buried with
   the black veil on his face.
