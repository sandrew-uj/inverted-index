   Prior to the beginning of the story, humanity has been expelled from
   Earth by powerful aliens known as "the Invaders", and scattered across
   eight planets and satellites of the Solar System, the so-called Eight
   Worlds. The Invaders originate from a gas giant planet, and have
   occupied Jupiter, forbidding human access to it. Human expansion to the
   Eight Worlds has been aided by a broadcast of information from outside
   the Solar System, named "The Ophiuchi hotline" after the constellation
   from which it appears to originate. The information received from this
   includes extensive material on biological modification, and while sex
   changes and other modifications have become routine surgeries,
   experimentation with human DNA remains taboo and forbidden on penalty
   of death. Related to this, while technology has been developed to allow
   people to back-up their memories, this is only permitted for
   implantation within a cloned body in case of death. Due to resource
   scarcity, only one clone of a person is allowed to exist at any one
   time, and, similarly, reproduction is restricted to one child per
   person. An exception exists for those people who join the
   artificially-created symbionts that can live openly in the vacuum of
   space.

   The protagonist, Lilo, has experimented with human DNA and, when
   discovered, is sentenced to death. However, the night before her
   execution, a powerful lunar politician named Tweed offers her the
   chance to escape her sentence by replacing her with a clone killed in
   her place. Lilo accepts and Tweed takes her into hiding.

   Tweed is the leader of a movement that intends to expel the Invaders
   and recover Earth, and makes Lilo join this movement under the watch of
   Vaffa, a guard that has multiple illegal clones, both male and female.
   Lilo attempts to escape twice, but each time she is killed by Vaffa,
   and a clone is revived with her original memories.

   The third clone of Lilo is sent to an outlying moon of Jupiter,
   Poseidon, within which Tweed pursues clandestine research performed by
   illegal clones. Lilo bonds with Cathay, the teacher of the colony's
   children, and they become lovers. She is given a null-field suit -- a
   conforming forcefield with an air generator that protects her from the
   vacuum -- and is tasked with researching how to kill creatures that
   live in Jupiter's atmosphere. She reveals to Cathay that, when she
   began her original experiments, she put a clone of herself and a backup
   of her memories in a secret base in Saturn's rings, to ensure her
   survival in the event that she was executed.

   Tweed then acquires a micro black hole with the intention of passing it
   through Jupiter in an attack on the Invaders. Lilo and Cathay board the
   ship transporting the black hole and seize it. After a struggle, Lilo
   and a Vaffa clone fall towards Jupiter. Vaffa dies, but Lilo encounters
   an Invader and is taken to a future version of Earth almost devoid of
   humanity.

   Tweed then awakens another version of Lilo and sends her with a clone
   of Vaffa to Pluto to research a new message coming from the Ophiuchi
   Hotline. This one has been translated as a payment demand for the
   information that humanity has received, but does not specify what form
   the payment is to take. Lilo and Vaffa find a second clone of Cathay,
   and the three of them are tasked to lease a ship from navigators
   dedicated to hunt for black holes, and go beyond the orbit of Pluto to
   analyze the message. They eventually hire Javelin, one of the most
   successful black hole hunters.

   Once in space, Javelin reveals that the black hole hunters have
   discovered that the beam of the Hotline originates from a point only
   half a light-year away from the solar system, scrambled to seem to come
   from much farther, and she will take them to the source of the beam.
   However, since the trip will take 20 years Lilo, Vaffa and Cathay go in
   hibernation.

   In the meantime, the first clone of Cathay uses the stolen ship to
   reach Lilo's base. There he meets Parameter/Solstice, a human-symbiont
   pair who also know the location of the base. They revive the clone and
   use the ship to attack Poseidon, taking it out of orbit and destroying
   its security systems. To do this they crash Lilo's base into a black
   hole held in a force field on the moon's surface. They carry out a plan
   to transform the asteroid into a ship to travel to Alpha Centauri, but
   reveal Tweed's dangerous activities to the Eight Worlds, forcing Tweed
   to go into hiding.

   When Javelin's ship and its passengers reaches the source of the
   Hotline, they are greeted by seemingly-human extraterrestrials who have
   been expecting them. They explain that most races in the universe have
   experienced a similar history with the Invaders: they are expelled from
   their home planets by the Invaders; they attempt to recover their
   planets by force, much as Tweed has been doing; and in the ensuing
   conflict they are driven out of their solar systems entirely. The
   extraterrestrials have been broadcasting information via the Ophiuchi
   Hotline to give humanity the tools they need for survival, and the
   price they ask in exchange is to be allowed to live alongside and
   within the minds of humans, so that they can add humanity's experience
   and thoughts to their own pool of knowledge. They suggest that, if
   humanity does not comply, they will turn the symbionts into an army
   that will attack humanity on the Eight Worlds.

   The clone of Lilo previously transported to Earth spends 25 years
   there. Because of her null-field suit which she can turn on at will,
   she is worshipped as a god by the surviving humans scratching a living
   at a pre-industrial technological level. During a dive to hunt a whale,
   she encounters an Invader, somehow steals a silver cube from it and is
   instantaneously transported to the source of the Hotline. There she
   meets her clone, and they find that the memories and knowledge of all
   of their clones, including those killed by Tweed, are somehow mixed and
   shared between them.

   Somewhat surprised by this turn of events, the extraterrestrials
   explain that the silver cube is a singularity that can be used for
   space propulsion by canceling inertia. They add that the Invaders only
   give such a "gift" to races when they're preparing to expel them
   entirely from their home planetary system. Confronted with this news,
   Javelin, Cathay, Vaffa and both clones of Lilo return to the solar
   systems to alert humanity.

   As the novel concludes, the clone of Lilo traveling in the asteroid
   towards Alpha Centauri meditates on her shared memories, and realizes
   that when she arrives there her fellow clones, and most of humanity,
   will be already be there waiting for her, having used the singularity
   for faster travel.
