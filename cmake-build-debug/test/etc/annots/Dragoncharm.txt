   The novel is populated by two species of dragons:
     * Charmed dragons are of an older, magical order and have four legs
       as well as wings. However, due to their proficiency with magic,
       wings are not needed to fly and thus these limbs take on a more
       decorative role. They also use magic to breathe fire and change
       their bodies at will.
     * Natural dragons use no magic, and have just four limbs, using their
       forelimbs to fly rather like bats, or wyverns. Many Natural dragons
       show fear and hatred of the Charmed, and around the time of the
       events of the novel, they greatly outnumber the older, dying race.
