   In 1878, Tessa Gray arrives from New York City to Southampton on the
   invitation of her brother, Nate, who has been working in London for the
   past few years, following the death of their aunt and foster mother,
   Harriet. However, she is kidnapped by a pair of warlocks, Mrs. Black
   and Mrs. Dark, who force her to learn her previously unknown ability to
   shapeshift at the threat of Nate's safety. They intend to make her
   presentable to marry their lord, known only as the Magister.

   Six weeks later, Tessa is rescued by a pair of Shadowhunters -- the
   older one named Henry Branwell and the younger named Will Herondale --
   who decapitate Mrs. Black and force Mrs. Dark to flee. Henry and Will
   take Tessa along with them to the London Institute, run by Henry's
   wife, Charlotte, and housing two other Shadowhunters: Jem Carstairs and
   Jessie Lovelace, as well as three mundane innkeepers: Sophie Collins,
   Thomas Tanner, and Agatha, who she is introduced to. After being
   examined by the Silent Brother Enoch, Charlotte tells Tessa that she is
   a Downworlder. However, it is unclear what exactly, other than the fact
   that she is capable of shapeshifting into anyone by holding any of
   their personal belongings.

   The next day, Jessie decides to take Tessa to shop for clothes and
   reveals during their stroll through Hyde Park that she despised being a
   shadowhunter and wished to be a proper lady. The two of them are
   attacked by an automaton, which Jessie destroys. Meanwhile, Charlotte
   learns from Axel Mortmain, Nate's former boss, that he was forced to
   work for Alexei de Quincey, head of London's vampire clan and the
   presumed identity of the Magister, leader of the secretive Pandemonium
   Club. Later, a vampire named Camille Belcourt visits the Institute and
   tells Charlotte that de Quincey is holding a party where his clan will
   prey on humans, in breach of the Accords with the Clave. Tessa
   disguises herself as Camille and visits the party with Will, where she
   encounters the warlock Magnus Bane, Camille's lover. The two discover
   that de Quincey's hostage is Nate, before alerting the Enclave to
   appear and kill most of the vampires, save de Quincey. The Enclave take
   Nate back to the Institute to be interrogated regarding de Quincey.
   Tessa helps Will take his medicine and they briefly kiss, not before
   Tessa heard the name 'Cecily' being whispered by Will. She is stung.

   The following evening, Tessa overhears the heated argument between Jem,
   Will and Charlotte, the latter assuming that it was due to the previous
   night's fiasco. Tessa barges in and gives Will a piece of her mind,
   shortly leaves the institute in fury and settles near the front stairs.
   Jem finds her and offers to take her through his favourite places in
   London at night to which she agrees. They are attacked by automatons
   hired by the Magister which nearly breach through the Institute before
   they are put down. Jem collapses and confesses later in his room to
   Tessa that the demon attack that killed his parents and forced him to
   move to London also made him depend on a demonic drug that will kill
   him in a few years. Nate recovers and tells the Institute that de
   Quincey is holing up in Chelsea. While most of the Enclave head to
   Chelsea to kill him, Tessa, Will, Jem, Jessie, Nate, and the innkeepers
   stay behind in the Institute. Mortmain arrives and informs them that
   Mrs. Dark is about to perform a spell to animate hundreds of automatons
   de Quincey possesses in Highgate. Will and Jem race there and are able
   to kill her. However, they find out too late that they had fallen into
   a trap: Mortmain and Nate, who are working together, lured most of the
   Shadowhunters away from the Institute so they can get their hands on
   Tessa, and Mortmain, and not de Quincey, is the real identity of the
   Magister. Jem manages the cat meant for the sacrifice.

   In the time Will and Jem are gone, Mortmain attacks the Institute with
   his automatons, killing Thomas and Agatha. When Nate tries to yank her
   away, Tessa's clockwork angel pendant, a memento from her late mother
   she brought from New York City, flickers and pushes him away, enabling
   her to flee, though she is eventually cornered by Mortmain. He reveals
   that Tessa's father is a demon and he, in a way, is her creator,
   because he had contacts with her mundane parents that made the
   conception possible. Mortmain offers Tessa the chance to go with him in
   exchange for her friends' safety. However, Tessa tricks Mortmain by
   making him believe that she is committing suicide, forcing him to flee
   just as Will arrives.

   After the funerals, Charlotte informs Tessa to stay at the Institute,
   despite the latter's belief that she is not welcome after what
   happened. Tessa attempts to get close to Will, only to be rebuffed
   harshly, making her storm off in anger. She seeks solace in Jem and
   retrieves back her clockwork angel. Will visits Magnus, who is waiting
   for Camille to come out of hiding, and asks him for help.
