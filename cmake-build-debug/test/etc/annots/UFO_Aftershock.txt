   Aftershock is set in a post-apocalyptic 2050, after the events of UFO:
   Aftermath. The game assumes that the player took up the Reticulans
   offer of resettling the most able of humanity in a space station, while
   allowing the rest to die, consumed by the Biomass that the Reticulans
   could not control. (However, in the first game the player could reject
   their offer, and save the Earth while defending against both the
   Reticulans and the Biomass.) Having lost contact with the Earth, the
   player must find out what happened.
