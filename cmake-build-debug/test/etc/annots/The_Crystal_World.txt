   Cover of 1967 Berkley Books paperback edition.

   The protagonist is Edward Sanders, an English medical doctor, who
   arrives to the river port of Port Matarre, in Cameroon. From here he
   tries to reach a leprosy treatment facility where his friends, Max and
   Suzanne Clair, live. Soon, however, he starts to recognize that a
   mysterious phenomenon is crystallizing the jungle along with its living
   creatures. The same phenomenon is reported to be present also in the
   Florida everglades and in the Pripyat Marshes (Soviet Union) as well.
   Scientific explanations of the phenomenon are provided within the book:
   however, Ballard offers mostly an interior and psychological
   perspective about it, directly through Sanders' experiences. Several
   facts, furthermore, remain unexplained: for example, the ability of
   jewels to liquefy the crystals. The crystals also have the property to
   keep objects and beings in a suspended state of existence. Many
   passages deal with this characteristic, pointing out its capability to
   stop time and life.

   In his route towards the deep of the forest, Sanders gets involved in a
   personal feud between Ventress, a Belgian architect, and Thorensen, the
   director of a diamond mine. In one of the most striking episodes of the
   novel, Sanders discovers the reason of the deadly rivalry to be
   Ventress' former wife, Serena, who is terminally ill with tuberculosis.
   After a final confrontation, Thorensen decides to remain in his house
   within the jungle, in spite of the encroaching crystallization process.
   Two of the other characters met by Sanders in his voyage spontaneously
   make the same decision: Balthus, an apostate priest, and Suzanne. The
   latter, nearly gone mad and sporting the first symptoms of leprosy, is
   portrayed towards the end of the novel as the leader of a band of
   lepers who set for the interior of the crystallizing forest, clearly to
   never come back.

   After having barely escaped from the now quickly spreading
   crystallization, Sanders reaches Port Matarre. Here, however, he makes
   the same decision as Balthus and Suzanne. In the final pages, Sanders
   goes back to the river to face the same fate as Suzanne.
