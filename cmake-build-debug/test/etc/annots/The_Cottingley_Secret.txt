   The Cottingley Secret takes place in England, during World War I, in
   1917. One of the main characters, Frances Griffiths, moves out of Cape
   Town, South Africa, with her mother because her father has to fight in
   the war. The book starts with Frances and her mother on a train taking
   them to their new lives in Cottingley, England, where her cousin, Elsie
   Wright, lives. The Cottingley Secret is a retelling of the story behind
   the Cottingley fairies and a series of purportedly real photographs
   created in Cottingley, a village in West Yorkshire, England. The plots
   follows the lives of the two cousins--Frances Griffiths and Elsie
   Wright--who photographed real fairies in the garden near a stream. The
   story follows the facts behind the real events--how the news attracted
   the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, how nationally renowned the
   girls became, and the hope of people who believed in the fantasy during
   war times.

   Gaynor's fictional reimagining continues into the present (2017) with
   Olivia Kavanagh, who after discovering her grandfather's manuscript and
   the picture of the fairies, realizes that her story becomes intertwined
   with the cousins' lives, causing past and present to blur together.
   Gaynor approaches the story intertwining past and present--in the form
   of a memoir written by Frances Griffiths that retells the past events,
   and through the present life of a fictional character (Olivia Kavanagh)
   whose family dates back to that time and place as well. The Cottingley
   Secret follows the life of Olivia. After her grandfather passes away,
   Olivia inherits his bookshop in Ireland called Something Old, so she
   decides to leave behind her life in London temporarily, which is tied
   to a fiancee and a steady job as a bookbinder. After finding a
   manuscript with Frances's story and photographs of fairies, Olivia
   begins to struggle with choosing between a settled life in London or a
   new adventure where she feels a connection and meaning behind her
   newfound work. As Olivia gets deeper into the story, she also makes the
   connection that someone from Frances's past is related to her family--a
   great grandmother. Having lost her own mother as a child and trying to
   take care of her grandmother, who suffers with Alzheimer's, Olivia
   believes that holding on to this story is the only way to reconnect
   with her family.

   Once Olivia finds out that the bookshop is under a threat of being shut
   down-- due to debts, she embarks on a mission to get all the necessary
   funds and restore the bookshop. After a lost little girl, Iris, wanders
   into the bookshop, Olivia meets Ross, a local writer who becomes the
   bookshop's writer-in-residence. Together, they manage to bring the
   bookshop back to life by organizing events for the public and promoting
   the antique books on a website to reach more customers. Olivia steadily
   begins to balance out the debts and becomes so enthralled by Frances'
   manuscript that she decides to visit Cottingley, the place where her
   grandmother also grew up. Before she travels, Jack--Olivia's
   fiancee--shows up at the bookshop's door because Olivia won't return
   his calls and is ignoring her wedding planning. Olivia had found out
   before her grandfather's death that she was infertile, something she'd
   kept from Jack. When Jack finds out, he flies to Ireland to find her
   and bring her back to London, despite how angry he was at the results.
   However, Olivia decides to stay in Ireland, break off her engagement,
   and continue her research into her family history and their connection
   to the Cottingley fairies.

   When Olivia finally travels to Cottingley, she discovers that the girl
   in her dreams that Frances also talked about in her memoir was her
   grandmother's sister, who died when she was a kid from a fall in the
   garden. Olivia's grandmother had been contacted when the body was found
   a decade later after Olivia's great grandmother passed away, and Olivia
   was able to visit the grave and put an end to her recurring dreams,
   finally satisfied with finding the connection between Frances' history
   and her own.
