   Stranded after a car accident in the Fenland village of Fenchurch St.
   Paul on New Year's Eve, Lord Peter Wimsey helps ring a nine-hour peal
   on the church bells overnight after William Thoday, one of the ringers,
   is struck down with influenza. Lady Thorpe, wife of Sir Henry, the
   local squire, dies the next morning and Wimsey hears how the family has
   been blighted by the theft 20 years previously of a valuable emerald
   necklace which was never recovered. The family's then butler, Deacon,
   and his accomplice from London, Cranton, were convicted and imprisoned.
   In 1918, long before the end of Deacon's prison term, he killed a
   warder and escaped. He apparently died shortly afterwards: the body lay
   in a quarry pit, where it was found two years later, still in his
   prison clothes. After Deacon's death became known his widow, Mary, had
   married William Thoday.

   When Sir Henry himself dies the following Easter, his wife's grave is
   opened for his burial and a man's body is found, mutilated beyond
   recognition. It is possibly that of an out-of-work labourer calling
   himself 'Stephen Driver' who had arrived in the village in early
   January; although, oddly, the dead man was wearing underclothes that
   had been made in France.

   Bunter, Wimsey's manservant, enquires at the Post Office for any
   uncollected letters. He gets hold of one that has been posted in
   France, addressed not to 'Driver' but to 'Paul Taylor' - a possible
   reference to 'Tailor Paul', the name of the tenor bell, the largest of
   the 'ring' in the parish church. The writer of the letter is traced and
   found to be the French wife of a British soldier listed as missing in
   action in 1918 but who evidently deserted. The soldier, Arthur
   Cobbleigh, appears to have known where the emeralds were hidden and
   plotted to recover them with 'Driver' - who is discovered to be
   Cranton. It appears that the dead man may in fact be Cobbleigh, Cranton
   having killed him after retrieving the emeralds.
   Bell-ringing in Stoke Gabriel parish church, Devon - similar to the
   change ringing described in the book

   An odd document found in the bell chamber proves to be a cipher,
   written on the same paper as the letter but in a different hand. Wimsey
   decodes it (which requires knowledge of change ringing) and it leads
   him to the emeralds, still untouched in their hiding place. He also
   shows the document to Mary Thoday. The Thodays abscond to London.
   Wimsey realises that they have gone there to be remarried, as Mary
   recognised the handwriting on the cipher as that of Deacon, her first
   husband, and realised that her wedding to William was void because
   Deacon was still alive at the time.

   Wimsey is now able to identify the dead man: it was Deacon himself, who
   had not in fact died at the quarry as had been thought. After his
   escape, Deacon had killed a soldier named Cobbleigh and swapped clothes
   and identities with him. After marrying bigamously in France he had
   waited several years to return for the emeralds that he had hidden in
   the church before his arrest. He had asked Cranton for help, sending
   him the cipher as a token of good faith. Cranton had nevertheless
   feared a double-cross and had broken into the church. He discovered
   Deacon's body but fled, saying nothing.

   William Thoday and his brother Jim, a merchant seaman, are interviewed
   together in London. William confesses that on 30 December he had
   encountered Deacon, whom he had long believed to be dead, prowling
   around the church. Desperate to protect his wife from the scandal of a
   bigamous marriage, he had tied Deacon up and locked him in the bell
   chamber, planning to bribe him to leave the country the next day.
   Unfortunately, his bout of influenza prevented him from returning, and
   it was only his delirious talk that led Jim to discover Deacon's dead
   body still tied up in the same place two days later. Jim, appalled at
   William's apparent brutality but loyal to him, had waited until the
   night following Lady Thorpe's funeral, when he had made the body
   unrecognisable, hidden it in her grave, then returned to his ship. When
   the body was rediscovered at Easter, each of the Thoday brothers
   thought that the other had killed Deacon. Neither can explain how he
   had in fact died.

   When Wimsey returns to Fenchurch the following Christmas, floods are
   threatening the countryside, and Wimsey climbs the tower as the bells
   are sounding out the alarm. The appalling noise in the bell chamber
   convinces him that Deacon, tied there for hours during the all-night
   New Year peal, could not have survived: Deacon had been killed by the
   bells themselves. Wimsey explains, "We needn't look for a murderer now.
   Because the murderers of Geoffrey Deacon are hanging already, and a
   good deal higher than Haman". William Thoday is drowned in the flood
   trying to save another man. Wimsey speculates that "I think perhaps he
   guessed at last how Geoffrey Deacon died and felt himself responsible".
