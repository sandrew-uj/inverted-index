   I always kind of looked at it like Rick and the Governor were two sides
   of the same coin. If Rick had gone down a certain path he could have
   ended up exactly like that guy. And so I had a story in mind of how he
   became that guy and what caused him to be that bad of a person.

   --Robert Kirkman discussing the general inception of the plot of Rise
   of the Governor with comparisons to the graphic novels.

   The novel follows the story of Philip Blake, his daughter Penny, his
   older brother Brian, and his friends Bobby and Nick as they struggle to
   survive in a world ravaged by the zombie apocalypse.

   The hungry group of survivors is hiding in a large house within the
   private neighborhood of Wiltshire Estates, planning to move on to
   Atlanta, where a "safe zone" is supposedly located. A walker comes out
   of its hiding place and infects Bobby with the undead plague, killing
   him. Distraught, the remaining four group members continue on.

   Once in Atlanta, they find the city swarming with walkers. The group
   frantically flees from a large herd of undead until they hear a voice
   calling them to an apartment building. The voice belongs to April
   Chalmers, who lets them into the building that she and her father,
   Dave, and sister, Tara, have secured.

   The elderly Dave expires and turns without having been bitten. After
   Philip "kills" Dave, tension grows between him and Tara. Philip
   sexually assaults April. The morning afterwards, April is nowhere to be
   found, and Tara forces the group, at gunpoint, to leave the building.

   The Blakes and Nick find a villa atop a hill and decide to stay there
   indefinitely. Brian's suspicions of a group following them are not
   taken seriously until the very group violently forces them out of the
   house. A firefight ensues, and as Brian flees with Penny in his arms,
   she is shot and killed, thus turning into one of the undead. Philip
   captures two shooters from the firefight and slowly and cruelly
   tortures them. Nick and Brian discover the torture victims and are
   horrified at what Philip has done. Brian tries to defend his brother,
   and Nick reluctantly agrees with Brian. Philip refuses to kill the
   zombified Penny, and this causes some concern for Nick, because he
   believes Philip is keeping Penny's soul from moving on. However, with
   some convincing, Nick agrees to keep the undead Penny with the group,
   and they all venture onwards until they stumble across the town of
   Woodbury.

   At Woodbury, there is not much order or unity among the citizens, but
   the tiny populace is led by a small group of ruthless National
   Guardsmen under the command of Major Gene Gavin. After chaining Penny
   in a nearby wooded area, the three men gain admission into the town.
   Philip manages to sneak Penny into his house during the night. Philip's
   mental instability becomes too much to bear for Nick and Brian one
   night, when they discover Philip attempting to murder a local girl in
   the woods. Nick kills Philip, and following this, Brian shoots Nick to
   death.

   Mentally and emotionally exhausted, Brian leaves the bodies in the
   woods for the walkers, and contemplates what he will do now that he is
   alone.

   After being herded into a "town meeting", Brian discovers that Major
   Gavin is attempting to make all its citizens "pull their own weight";
   if anyone refuses or dissents, they will be shot. A man, Detroit,
   dismissing the decree as ludicrous, attempts to leave the town meeting
   and is immediately shot by Major Gavin. Brian feels himself undergoing
   a metamorphosis as he shoots Major Gavin. The Woodbury citizens begin
   to crowd around him and, when he is asked by Caesar Martinez for his
   name, Brian replies: "Philip Blake".
