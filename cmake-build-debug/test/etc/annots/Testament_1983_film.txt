   The Wetherly family -- husband Tom, wife Carol, and children Brad, Mary
   Liz, and Scottie -- live in the fictional suburb of Hamelin,
   California, within a 90-minute drive of San Francisco, where Tom works.

   On a routine afternoon, Carol listens to an answering-machine message
   from Tom saying he's on his way home for dinner. Scottie watches Sesame
   Street on TV when the show is suddenly replaced by white noise; a San
   Francisco news anchor appears onscreen, saying they have lost their New
   York signal and there were explosions of "nuclear devices there in New
   York, and up and down the East Coast." The anchorman is cut off by the
   Emergency Broadcast System tone. An announcer's voice states that the
   White House is interrupting the program, but just as the President is
   introduced the TV and electricity in the house go dark. Suddenly, the
   blinding flash of a nuclear detonation is seen through the window. The
   family huddles on the floor in panic as the town's air-raid sirens go
   off; minutes later, several of their neighbors are seen running around
   on the street outside, dazed in fear and confusion. The family tries to
   remain calm, hoping Tom is safe.

   The suburb of Hamelin seems to survive relatively unscathed. Frightened
   residents meet at the home of Henry Abhart, an elderly ham radio
   operator. He has made contact with survivors in rural areas and
   internationally, and tells Carol that he was unable to reach anyone
   east of Keokuk, Iowa. He reveals that the entire Bay Area and all major
   U.S. cities are radio-silent. The morning after the attack, they are
   joined by a boy named Larry who tells Carol his parents never returned
   home from San Francisco; he later succumbs to radiation poisoning.
   Despite Abhart's efforts, no one knows or finds out either the reason
   for the attack or the responsible parties. Rumors from other radio
   operators range from a Soviet preemptive strike to terrorism.

   The school play about the Pied Piper of Hamelin was in rehearsal before
   the bombings; desperate to recapture some normality, the town decides
   to go on with the show anyway. The parents smile and applaud, many of
   them in tears. The day after the attack, the children notice "sand" on
   their breakfast plates: contaminated fallout dirt settling back onto
   the ground from the blast. Residents now have to cope with losing
   municipal services, food and gas shortages and, ultimately, the loss of
   loved ones to radiation poisoning. Brad plays with a toy that makes a
   noise identical to one heard in Kraftwerk's song Home Computer.
   Scottie, the first to succumb, is buried in the back yard. Wooden
   caskets are used as fuel for funeral pyres instead as the dead
   accumulate faster than they can be buried. Carol sews together a burial
   shroud from bed sheets for her daughter, Mary Liz, who also dies from
   radiation exposure.

   While many of the children die, older residents fall to rapid dementia,
   and order in the town starts to break down as police and firefighter
   ranks dwindle. A young couple leave town after losing their infant,
   hoping to find safety and solace elsewhere. Carol's search for a
   battery causes her to listen once more to her husband's final message
   on the answering machine. To her sorrow, she finds a later (and
   previously unheard) message on the machine from Tom: he decided to stay
   at work late in San Francisco on the day of the attack, and she gives
   up her last hope that he will return home.

   Son Brad, forced into early adulthood, helps his mother and takes over
   the radio for Henry Abhart. The family adopts a mentally disabled boy
   named Hiroshi, who Tom used to take fishing along with his children,
   after Hiroshi's father Mike dies. Soon thereafter Carol starts showing
   signs of radiation poisoning. Carol decides she, Brad and Hiroshi
   should avoid a slow and painful death from radiation poisoning and
   instead take their own lives via carbon monoxide poisoning. They gather
   in the family's station wagon with the engine running and the garage
   door closed, but Carol cannot bring herself to go through with the
   deed. The are finally seen sitting by candlelight to celebrate Brad's
   birthday, using a graham cracker in place of a cake. When asked what
   they should wish for, Carol answers: "That we remember it all...the
   good and the awful." She blows out the candle. An old family home movie
   of a surprise birthday party for Tom plays, showing him as he blows out
   the candles on his cake.
