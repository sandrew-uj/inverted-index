   Throughout his adventures, Bod learns supernatural abilities such as
   Fading (allows him to turn invisible, but only if no one is paying
   attention to him), Haunting (which allows Bod to make people feel
   uneasy, though this ability can be amplified to terrify them), and
   Dreamwalking (going into others' dreams and controlling the dream,
   though he cannot cause physical harm).
