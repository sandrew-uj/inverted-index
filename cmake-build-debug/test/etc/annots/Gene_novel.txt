   In dealing with genetic memory, Pavlou has drawn on both the nature of
   lineage, and the nature of self. Several characters all stem from the
   same source, and so as their memories become unlocked during the course
   of the novel, they each identify with being the same person at a
   distant point in history. The question of identity then becomes
   fundamental to the plot. If each character shares the same memories are
   they a reincarnation of that original person, or merely an echo?

   The novel is further complicated in that it is told backwards, using a
   Police procedural as the structure of the novel, memories are unlocked
   in the form of flashbacks, each flashback delving further and further
   back in time over the course of 3000 years.

   Told in alternating first person and third person, the novel is divided
   into a prologue and seven "books", the seven trials of Cyclades.

   The opening page begins with the first 27 lines of the Human Genome.
   Thereafter the prologue lays out the death of Cyclades during the
   Trojan War, and makes it clear that his death is merely the beginning
   of the journey. Told in first person, Cyclades, a Greek warrior, is
   mortally wounded. A Sybil forces him to have sex to continue his line,
   whereupon he dies for the first time in the book.

   Book One, shifts to third person and jumps to the year 2004. In New
   York City Detective James North has been called to the Metropolitan
   Museum of Art to deal with a mentally unstable man who has run amok
   amid the exhibits.
