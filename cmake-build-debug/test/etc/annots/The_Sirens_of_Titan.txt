   Malachi Constant is the richest man in a future North America. He
   possesses extraordinary luck that he attributes to divine favor which
   he has used to build upon his father's fortune. He becomes the
   centerpoint of a journey that takes him from Earth to Mars in
   preparation for an interplanetary war, to Mercury with another Martian
   survivor of that war, back to Earth to be pilloried as a sign of Man's
   displeasure with his arrogance, and finally to Titan where he again
   meets the man ostensibly responsible for the turn of events that have
   befallen him, Winston Niles Rumfoord.

   Rumfoord comes from a wealthy New England background. His private
   fortune was large enough to fund the construction of a personal
   spacecraft, and he became a space explorer. Traveling between Earth and
   Mars, his ship--carrying Rumfoord and his dog, Kazak--entered a
   phenomenon known as a chrono-synclastic infundibulum, which is defined
   in the novel as "those places ... where all the different kinds of
   truths fit together." When they enter the infundibulum, Rumfoord and
   Kazak become "wave phenomena", somewhat akin to the probability waves
   encountered in quantum mechanics. They exist along a spiral stretching
   from the Sun to the star Betelgeuse. When a planet, such as the Earth,
   intersects their spiral, Rumfoord and Kazak materialize, temporarily,
   on that planet.

   When he entered the chrono-synclastic infundibulum, Rumfoord became
   aware of the past and future. Throughout the novel, he predicts events;
   unless he is deliberately lying, the predictions come true. It is in
   this state that Rumfoord established the "Church of God the Utterly
   Indifferent" on Earth to unite the planet after a Martian invasion. It
   is also in this state that Rumfoord, materializing on different
   planets, instigated the Martian invasion, which was designed to fail
   spectacularly. On Titan, the only place where he can exist permanently
   as a solid human being, Rumfoord befriends a traveller from
   Tralfamadore (a world that also figures in Vonnegut's
   Slaughterhouse-Five, among others) who needs a small metal component to
   repair his damaged spaceship.

   Salo, the Tralfamadorian explorer, is a robot built millennia earlier
   to carry a message to a distant galaxy. His spacecraft is powered by
   the Universal Will to Become or UWTB, the "prime mover" which makes
   matter and organization wish to appear out of nothingness. (UWTB,
   Vonnegut informs the reader, was responsible for the Universe in the
   first place and is the greatest imaginable power source). A small
   component on Salo's spacecraft breaks and strands him here in the Solar
   System for over 200 millennia. He requests help from Tralfamadore, and
   his fellow Tralfamadorians respond by manipulating human history so
   that primitive humans evolve and create a civilization in order to
   produce the replacement part. Rumfoord's encounter with the
   chrono-synclastic infundibulum, the following war with Mars and
   Constant's exile to Titan were manipulated via the Tralfamadorians'
   control of the UWTB. Stonehenge, the Great Wall of China and the
   Kremlin are all messages in the Tralfamadorian geometrical language,
   informing Salo of their progress.

   As it turns out, the replacement part is a small metal strip, brought
   to Salo by Constant and his son Chrono (born of Rumfoord's ex-wife). A
   sunspot disrupts Rumfoord's spiral, sending him and Kazak separately
   into the vastness of space. An argument between Rumfoord and Salo
   moments before concerning the contents of Salo's message, left
   unresolved because of Rumfoord's disappearance, leads the distraught
   Salo to disassemble himself, thereby stranding the humans on Titan. It
   is revealed that the message was a single dot, meaning 'Greetings' in
   Tralfamadorian. Chrono chooses to live among the Titanian birds; after
   thirty-two years, his mother dies and Constant manages to reassemble
   Salo. Using the part delivered so many years previously by Chrono,
   Constant repairs the Tralfamadorian saucer. Salo returns Constant to
   Earth where he dies of exposure in wintertime Indianapolis while
   awaiting an overdue city bus and as he passes away, he experiences a
   pleasant hallucination secretly implanted in his mind by a
   compassionate Salo.
