   The Good Soldier

   The Good Soldier is narrated by the character John Dowell, half of one
   of the couples whose dissolving relationships form the subject of the
   novel. Dowell tells the story of those dissolutions, plus the deaths of
   three characters and the madness of a fourth, in a rambling,
   non-chronological fashion. As an unreliable narrator the reader can
   consider whether they believe Dowell and his description of how the
   events unfolded including his own role in the "saddest story ever
   told".
