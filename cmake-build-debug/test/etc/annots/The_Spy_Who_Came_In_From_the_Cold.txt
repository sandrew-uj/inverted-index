   The Spy Who Came In from the Cold occurs during the heightened tensions
   that characterised the late 1950s and early 1960s Cold War, when a
   Warsaw Pact-NATO war sparked in Germany seemed likely. The story begins
   and concludes in Berlin, about a year after the completion of the
   Berlin Wall and around the time when double-agent Heinz Felfe was
   exposed and tried.

   Le Carre's debut novel, Call for the Dead, introduced the characters
   George Smiley and Hans-Dieter Mundt. In that story, Smiley investigates
   the suicide of Samuel Fennan. He quickly establishes a link between the
   East German Secret Service and the deceased, and learns that Mundt, an
   assassin, killed the man after a misunderstanding between Fennan and
   their controller, Dieter Frey. Mundt escaped from England shortly
   after, getting back into East Germany before Smiley and Guillam could
   catch him. The Spy Who Came In from the Cold picks up two years later,
   where Mundt has had a somewhat meteoric rise to become the head of the
   Abteilung, because of his success with counter-intelligence operations
   against British networks, as well as a member of the Presidium of the
   Socialist Unity Party. Characters and events from The Spy Who Came In
   from the Cold are reinvestigated in A Legacy of Spies, le Carre's 2017
   novel centering on an aging Guillam.
