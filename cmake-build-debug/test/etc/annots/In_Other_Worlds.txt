   Carl Schirmer's life is transformed when he is turned into energy by an
   eighth-dimensional being and transported to a faraway world at the edge
   of a black hole.

   What follows is a thrilling ride similar to Flash Gordon involving a
   woman from the end of time, a man who can live off sunlight, and an
   alternate, paradisaical Earth in which World War II never happened.
