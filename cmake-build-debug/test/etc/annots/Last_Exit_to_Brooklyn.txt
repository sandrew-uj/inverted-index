   The stories are set almost entirely in what is now considered the
   Sunset Park section of Brooklyn; the location is widely misreported as
   Red Hook, where one story is set and parts of the 1989 movie were
   filmed. Last Exit to Brooklyn is divided into six parts that can,
   more or less, be read separately. Each part is prefaced with a passage
   from the Bible.
     * Another Day, Another Dollar: A gang of young Brooklyn hoodlums hang
       around an all-night diner and get into a vicious fight with a group
       of US Army soldiers on leave.
     * The Queen Is Dead: Georgette, a sassy transgender hooker, is thrown
       out of the family home by her homophobic brother and tries to
       attract the attention of a ruthless hoodlum named Vinnie at a
       benzedrine-driven party. Georgette dies by a drug overdose after
       the party.
     * And Baby Makes Three: The story told by an unknown narrator about a
       couple, Suzy and Tommy who have a baby out of wedlock, and their
       wedding, and baby's christening party is quickly thrown by Suzy's
       parents.
     * Tralala: The title character of an earlier Selby short story, she
       is a young Brooklyn prostitute who makes a living propositioning
       sailors in bars and stealing their money. In perhaps the novel's
       most notorious scene, she is brutally gang-raped after a night of
       heavy drinking. She is left for dead in a vacant lot and ends up
       most likely dying.
     * Strike: Harry, a machinist in a factory, becomes a local official
       in the union. He is a closeted gay man, he abuses his wife, tries
       to boast his accomplishments and his high status to anyone who
       might listen to convince himself that he is a man. He gains a
       temporary status and importance during a long strike, and uses the
       union's money to entertain the young street punks and buy the
       company of drag queens and gay men.
     * Landsend: Described as a "coda" for the book, this section presents
       the intertwined, yet ordinary day of numerous denizens in a housing
       project.
