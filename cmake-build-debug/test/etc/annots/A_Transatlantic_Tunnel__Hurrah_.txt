   In an alternative history, the United States lost the American
   Revolutionary War and George Washington was executed for treason. Thus,
   America in 1973 is still under the control of the British Empire. The
   divergence point between this world and our own occurred far earlier,
   however, when the Moors won the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa on the
   Iberian peninsula, on July 16, 1212. Thus it was that Spain was unable
   to become unified, owing to the survival of an Islamic presence in its
   territory, and therefore could not finance the expedition of
   Christopher Columbus in 1492. Instead, it was John Cabot who discovered
   America, just a few years later.

   The protagonist, Captain Augustine Washington, is a direct descendant
   of George Washington, and labors in his 'traitorous' shadow. Captain
   Washington and Sir Isambard Brassey-Brunel (descendant of Isambard
   Kingdom Brunel) get together to link the heart of the British Empire
   with its far-flung Atlantic colony in North America, although they fall
   out over Augustine's wooing of Isambard's young daughter, Iris, and as
   a result of disputes over engineering techniques. However, after a
   number of adventures the two are reconciled on Sir Isambard's deathbed,
   and the lovers later marry.

   Detective Richard Tracy also makes an appearance, as do 'Lord' Amis and
   'Reverend' Aldiss. An appearance in connection with a suborbital rocket
   is also made by an expert who prefers a mechanical Babbage machine for
   computing to the electronic kind named Arthur C. Clarke.
