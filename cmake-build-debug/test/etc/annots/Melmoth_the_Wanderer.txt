   John Melmoth, a student in Dublin, visits his dying uncle. He finds a
   portrait of a mysterious ancestor called "Melmoth"; the portrait is
   dated 1646. At his uncle's funeral, John is told an old family story
   about a stranger called Stanton, who arrived looking for "Melmoth the
   Traveller" decades earlier.

   A manuscript left by Stanton describes his first finding Melmoth
   laughing at the sight of two lovers who have been struck by lightning,
   and hearing of a wedding at which Melmoth was an uninvited guest: the
   bride died and the bridegroom went mad. Stanton's search for Melmoth is
   deemed to be madness and he is sent to a madhouse. Melmoth visits him
   there, and offers to free him, but Stanton refuses and escapes.

   Following his uncle's wish, John burns the Melmoth portrait. He is
   visited by Melmoth in a dream, and later sees Melmoth laughing at a
   shipwreck. John tries to approach him, but slips and falls into the
   sea. He is saved from drowning by the sole survivor of the wreck, a
   Spaniard, Alonzo Monc,ada.

   Alonzo Monc,ada tells his story (The Tale of the Spaniard), in which
   his family confines him to a monastery. He is mistreated by the monks,
   and his brother Juan arranges for him to escape with the help of a
   fellow monk, a parricide. The escape plan is a trap and Juan is killed.
   Monc,ada is taken to the prison of the Inquisition. There he is visited
   in his cell by Melmoth, who says he will help him escape. A fire breaks
   out, and in the confusion Monc,ada escapes. He meets a venerable Jewish
   scholar, Adonijah, who lives in a secret chamber decorated with the
   skeletons of his own family. In exchange for food and shelter, Adonijah
   compels Monc,ada to transcribe a manuscript for him: "the Tale of the
   Indians".
   Monks drag a young man across the floor of a vaulted room, presenting
   him to a seated bishop.

   The Tale of the Indians tells of an island in the Indian Ocean which is
   rumored to be haunted by a white goddess named "Immalee". In reality,
   Immalee is a castaway who grew up alone on the island, isolated from
   humanity. She is visited by Melmoth, who tells her he comes from "the
   world that suffers". He tries to destroy her innocence, showing her the
   shortcomings of human societies and religions. She falls in love with
   him and begs him to stay with her, but he departs. Three years later,
   Immalee, now named Isidora, has been restored to her family in Madrid.
   Melmoth reappears and he and Isidora elope by night; he leads her to a
   remote chapel where they are married by an undead hermit.

   Isidora's father encounters a stranger at an inn who tells him The Tale
   of Guzman's Family. Guzman is a wealthy Spanish merchant whose sister
   marries a poor German musician, Walberg. Guzman decides to make
   Walberg's family his heirs, but his will leaves everything to the
   church, and the family sinks into poverty; almost insane, Walberg
   decides to end their poverty by killing them all -- but before he does
   so news arrives that the true will has been found and the family is
   saved. By this point in the story, Isidora's father has fallen asleep,
   and wakes to find the stranger at the inn replaced by Melmoth.

   Melmoth tells him The Lovers' Tale, about a young woman in Yorkshire
   named Elinor, who is jilted at the altar and is subsequently tempted by
   Melmoth, but refuses his help.

   The Tale of the Indians resumes: Isidora returns to her family, but she
   is pregnant with Melmoth's child. She has a presentiment that she will
   not live, and gets Melmoth to promise that the child will be raised as
   a Christian. Isidora's father finds a husband for her, but in the
   middle of the wedding celebrations, Melmoth tries to abduct Isidora.
   Her brother tries to intervene, and Melmoth kills him. Isidora falls
   senseless and Melmoth escapes. Isidora reveals that she is already
   married, to Melmoth. She gives birth, but she and her baby daughter are
   imprisoned by the Inquisition. The inquisitors threaten to take away
   the child, but find that it is already dead. Isidora, dying of grief,
   remembers her island paradise, and asks if "he" will be in the heavenly
   paradise.

   Monc,ada and John are interrupted by the appearance of Melmoth himself.
   He confesses to them his purpose on Earth, that his extended life is
   almost over, and that he has never been successful in tempting another
   into damnation: "I have traversed the world in the search, and no one
   to gain that world, would lose his own soul!". Melmoth has a dream of
   his own damnation, and of the salvation of Stanton, Walberg, Elinor,
   Isidora and Monc,ada. He asks John and Monc,ada to leave him alone for
   his last few hours of mortal existence. They hear terrible sounds from
   the room, but when they enter, the room is empty. They follow Melmoth's
   tracks to the top of a cliff, and see his handkerchief on a crag below
   them. "Exchanging looks of silent and unutterable horror", they return
   home.
