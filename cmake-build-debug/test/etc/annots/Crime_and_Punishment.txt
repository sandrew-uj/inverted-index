   Dostoevsky conceived the idea of Crime and Punishment, prompted by the
   case of Pierre Franc,ois Lacenaire, in the summer of 1865.[citation
   needed] He had been working on another project at the time entitled The
   Drunkards, which was to deal with "the present question of drunkenness
   ...  all its ramifications, especially the picture of a family and
   the bringing up of children in these circumstances, etc., etc." This
   theme, centering on the story of the Marmeladov family, became
   ancillary to the story of Raskolnikov and his crime.

   At the time Dostoevsky owed large sums of money to creditors and was
   trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early
   1864. After appeals elsewhere failed, Dostoevsky turned as a last
   resort to the publisher Mikhail Katkov and sought an advance on a
   proposed contribution. He offered his story or novella (at the time
   he was not thinking of a novel) for publication in Katkov's monthly
   journal The Russian Messenger--a prestigious publication of its kind,
   and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy. Dostoevsky,
   having been engaged in polemical debates with Katkov in the early
   1860s, had never published anything in its pages before. In a letter to
   Katkov written in September 1865, Dostoevsky explained to him that the
   work was to be about a young man who yields to "certain strange,
   'unfinished' ideas, yet floating in the air". He planned to
   explore the moral and psychological dangers of the ideology of
   "radicalism", and felt that the project would appeal to the
   conservative Katkov. In letters written in November 1865 an
   important conceptual change occurred: the "story" has become a "novel".
   From then on, Crime and Punishment is referred to as a novel.
   At the end of November much had been written and was ready; I burned it
   all; I can confess that now. I didn't like it myself. A new form, a new
   plan excited me, and I started all over again.

   1866

   In the complete edition of Dostoevsky's writings published in the
   Soviet Union, the editors reassembled the writer's notebooks for Crime
   and Punishment in a sequence roughly corresponding to the various
   stages of composition. As a result, there exists a
   fragmentary working draft of the novella, as initially conceived, as
   well as two other versions of the text. These have been distinguished
   as the Wiesbaden edition, the Petersburg edition, and the final plan,
   involving the shift from a first-person narrator to Dostoevsky's
   innovative use of third-person narrative to achieve first-person
   narrative perspectives. Dostoevsky initially considered four
   first-person plans: a memoir written by Raskolnikov, his confession
   recorded eight days after the murder, his diary begun five days after
   the murder, and a mixed form in which the first half was in the form of
   a memoir, and the second half in the form of a diary. The
   Wiesbaden edition concentrates entirely on the moral and psychological
   reactions of the narrator after the murder. It coincides roughly with
   the story that Dostoevsky described in his letter to Katkov and,
   written in the form of a diary or journal, corresponds to what
   eventually became part 2 of the finished work.
   I wrote  with genuine inspiration, but perhaps it is no
   good; but for them the question is not its literary worth, they are
   worried about its morality. Here I was in the right--nothing was
   against morality, and even quite the contrary, but they saw otherwise
   and, what's more, saw traces of nihilism ... I took it back, and this
   revision of a large chapter cost me at least three new chapters of
   work, judging by the effort and the weariness; but I corrected it and
   gave it back.

   -- Dostoevsky's letter to A.P. Milyukov

   Why Dostoevsky abandoned his initial version remains a matter of
   speculation. According to Joseph Frank, "one possibility is that his
   protagonist began to develop beyond the boundaries in which he had
   first been conceived". The notebooks indicate that Dostoevsky
   became aware of the emergence of new aspects of Raskolnikov's character
   as the plot developed, and he structured the novel in conformity with
   this "metamorphosis". The final version of Crime and Punishment
   came into being only when, in November 1865, Dostoevsky decided to
   recast his novel in the third person. This shift was the culmination of
   a long struggle, present through all the early stages of
   composition. Once having decided, Dostoevsky began to rewrite from
   scratch and was able to easily integrate sections of the early
   manuscript into the final text. Frank says that he did not, as he told
   Wrangel, burn everything he had written earlier.

   Dostoevsky was under great pressure to finish Crime and Punishment on
   time, as he was simultaneously contracted to finish The Gambler for
   Stellovsky, who had imposed extremely harsh conditions. Anna Snitkina,
   a stenographer who later became Dostoevsky's wife, was of great help to
   him during this difficult task. The first part of Crime and
   Punishment appeared in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger,
   and the last one was published in December 1866.

   The title refers to Italian criminologist and philosopher Cesare
   Beccaria's "Dei delitti e delle pene" (On Crimes and Punishment, 1764),
   a text known in Russia due to an 1803 translation.
