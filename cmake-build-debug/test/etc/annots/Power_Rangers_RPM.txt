   An AI computer virus named Venjix takes over all of the Earth's
   computers, creates an army of robot "Grinder" droids and destroys or
   enslaves almost all of humanity. Only the city of Corinth remains,
   protected by an almost impenetrable force field from the toxic
   atmosphere of the wasteland outside. Venjix tries various plans to
   destroy Corinth and Doctor K's RPM Power Rangers fight to protect it.
