   In the 1880s, in Paris, the Palais Garnier Opera House is believed to
   be haunted by an entity known as the Phantom of the Opera, or simply
   the Opera Ghost. A stagehand named Joseph Buquet is found hanged, the
   noose around his neck missing.

   At a gala performance for the retirement of the opera house's two
   managers, a young, little-known Swedish soprano, Christine Daae, is
   called upon to sing in place of the Opera's leading soprano, Carlotta,
   who is ill, and Christine's performance is an astonishing success. The
   Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who was present at the performance, recognizes
   her as his childhood playmate and recalls his love for her. He attempts
   to visit her backstage, where he hears a man complimenting her from
   inside her dressing room. He investigates the room once Christine
   leaves, only to find it empty.

   At Perros-Guirec, Christine meets with Raoul, who confronts her about
   the voice he heard in her room. Christine tells him she has been
   tutored by the Angel of Music, whom her father used to tell them about.
   When Raoul suggests that she might be the victim of a prank, she storms
   off. Christine visits her father's grave one night, where a mysterious
   figure appears and plays the violin for her. Raoul attempts to confront
   it but is attacked and knocked out in the process.

   Back at the Palais Garnier, the new managers receive a letter from the
   Phantom demanding that they allow Christine to perform the lead role of
   Marguerite in Faust, and that Box 5 be left empty for his use, lest
   they perform in a house with a curse on it. The managers assume his
   demands are a prank and ignore them, resulting in disastrous
   consequences, as Carlotta ends up croaking like a toad, and the
   chandelier suddenly drops into the audience, killing a spectator. The
   Phantom, having abducted Christine from her dressing room, reveals
   himself as a deformed man called Erik.

   Erik intends to hold her prisoner in his lair with him for a few days.
   Still, she causes him to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to
   the horror of both, beholds his noseless, sunken-eyed face, which
   resembles a skull dried up by the centuries. Fearing that she will
   leave him, he decides to hold her permanently, but when Christine
   requests release after two weeks, he agrees on the condition that she
   wear his ring and be faithful to him.

   On the roof of the Opera House, Christine tells Raoul about her
   abduction and makes Raoul promise to take her away to a place where
   Erik can never find her, even if she resists. Raoul tells Christine he
   will act on his promise the next day, to which she agrees. However,
   Christine sympathizes with Erik and decides to sing for him one last
   time as a means of saying goodbye. Unbeknownst to Christine and Raoul,
   Erik has been watching them and overheard their whole conversation.

   The following night, the enraged and jealous Erik abducts Christine
   during a production of Faust and tries to force her to marry him. Raoul
   is led by a mysterious Opera regular known only as "The Persian" into
   Erik's secret lair deep in the bowels of the Opera House. Still, they
   end up trapped in a mirrored room by Erik, who threatens that unless
   Christine agrees to marry him, he will kill them and everyone in the
   Opera House by using explosives.

   Christine agrees to marry Erik. Erik initially tries to drown Raoul and
   the Persian, using the water which would have been used to douse the
   explosives. Still, Christine begs and offers to be his "living bride,"
   promising him not to kill herself after becoming his bride, as she had
   just attempted suicide. Erik eventually releases Raoul and the Persian
   from his torture chamber.

   When Erik is alone with Christine, he lifts his mask to kiss her on her
   forehead and is eventually given a kiss back. Erik reveals that he has
   never kissed anyone, including his own mother, who would run away if he
   ever tried to kiss her. He is overcome with emotion. He and Christine
   then cry together, and their tears "mingle." She also holds his hand
   and says, "Poor, unhappy Erik," which reduces him to "a dog ready to
   die for her."

   He allows the Persian and Raoul to escape, though not before making
   Christine promise that she will visit him on his death day and return
   the gold ring he gave her. He also makes the Persian promise that
   afterward, he will go to the newspaper and report his death, as he will
   die soon "of love."

   Indeed, sometime later, Christine returns to Erik's lair, and by his
   request, buries him someplace where he will never be found, and returns
   the gold ring. Afterward, a local newspaper runs the simple note: "Erik
   is dead." Christine and Raoul elope together, never to return.

   The epilogue pieces together bits of Erik's life, information that "the
   narrator" obtained from the Persian. It is revealed that Erik was the
   son of a construction business owner, deformed at birth. He ran away
   from his native Normandy to work in fairs and caravans, schooling
   himself in the arts of the circus across Europe and Asia, and
   eventually building trick palaces in Persia and Turkey. Eventually, he
   returned to France and started his own construction business. After
   being subcontracted to work on the Palais Garnier's foundations, Erik
   had discreetly built himself a lair to disappear in, complete with
   hidden passages and other tricks that allowed him to spy on the
   managers.
