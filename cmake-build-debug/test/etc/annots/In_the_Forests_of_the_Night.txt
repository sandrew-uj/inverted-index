   The book is set in and around the author's home town of Concord,
   Massachusetts and in the realm of Nyeusigrube. The book centers around
   Risika who born in 1684 as Rachel Weatere, a God-fearing
   seventeen-year-old who lived with her father, half-sister, Lynette, and
   her twin brother, Alexander. Alexander lives in fear as he believes he
   is of the Devil as he is able to hear people's thoughts and cause
   things to happen, including manipulating fire, causing him to
   inadvertently burn his sister Lynette. Aware of her twin brother's
   powers and his dislike for them, Rachel tries to do her best to comfort
   him. One day, an unknown stranger appears at their home, who is later
   revealed as Aubrey and gives Rachel a black rose, which pricks her
   finger, drawing blood. That night, Rachel hears her twin creep past her
   room and she follows him to find him confronting two vampires, Ather
   and Aubrey, who had come to transform Rachel against her will into a
   vampire to get back at Alexander for interfering with Ather when she
   tried to feed on Lynette. In an attempt to stop Ather from harming her
   brother, Rachel confronts Ather but Aubrey grabs her brother and drags
   him off, while exposing a knife. Rachel tries to go after them but
   Ather grabs her instead and begins her transformation into a vampire.

   Three hundred years later, Rachel, now calling herself Risika, has a
   run-in with Aubrey after accidentally trespassing onto his territory in
   an attempt to feed, he leaves her another black rose and a note
   stating, "Stay in your place, Risika." Fearing Aubrey, but not letting
   it on, she burns the note and leaves it where Aubrey can find it, and
   does not visit the Bengal tiger which she has named Tora, in fear that
   Aubrey would use Tora to hurt her. Eventually Aubrey learns of Tora's
   existence and in an attempt to get Risika to lay low, he kills the
   tiger. Wounded once more, Risika takes on the tiger's stripes in her
   hair and finds a note with the name "Rachel" written on it and covered
   with tears. Enraged and thinking the note a joke, she calls out to
   whoever left the note but no one answers. She then takes off,
   transforming into a hawk, to confront Aubrey, and a fight breaks out
   between the two and Risika realizes she can defeat him and transforms
   herself into a Bengal tiger and pins Aubrey to the ground. In
   desperation and not wanting to die, Aubrey offers Risika his blood,
   which opens his mind to Risika. Accepting this, Risika transforms back
   to herself and takes Aubrey's blood but before allowing him to leave
   she takes the knife he carries, which she had found out nearly 300
   years ago contains magic from one of the witch's clans, and slashes him
   in his collarbone, avenging the scar he had left on her not too long
   after she had been transformed and tells him to remember the events of
   that day and warns him that even though she has taken his blood it did
   not make up for the death of Tora or Alexander. After Aubrey leaves,
   Alexander reveals to Risika that he is still alive and that he was the
   one who had left her the note. He reveals that the reason Ather changed
   her was out of revenge against Alexander for having interrupting her
   trying feed on Lynette. Believing he could help his sister, Risika
   informs him that she is happy as she is and the story ends.
