   An 1859 engraving of the novel's protagonist

   The work is narrated in the first person by the 'Graf von O**' (Count
   of O**). It describes the story of a German prince visiting Venice at
   carnival time. Right at the start of the work, the Count stresses that
   this story might sound incredible, but that he had witnessed it with
   his own eyes. Furthermore, he talks of his disinterest in deceiving the
   public as "at the time these pages will tread into the world, I will
   not be and will neither win nor lose by the account given."

   Structurally and stylistically it is not a single story, but tells of a
   Jesuit secret society trying to convert a Protestant German prince to
   Catholicism and bring him to the throne back home in order to bolster
   its own power base. Writing of the Prince's fate, Schiller shows him as
   the key to the conflict between passion and morality, passion and duty.

   The work's passages on religious and historical philosophy show
   Schiller's Enlightenment ideals, with his critique of religion and
   society to the fore, though a deeper exploration of Immanuel Kant was
   to follow later. Due to the novel's slow formation and the author's
   antipathy to it, it was not planned from start to finish and its style
   and structure is not uniform throughout, ranging from rhetorical prose,
   to theatrical prose, to dialogues reminiscent of Don Carlos, to the
   popular elements of Gothic fiction.
