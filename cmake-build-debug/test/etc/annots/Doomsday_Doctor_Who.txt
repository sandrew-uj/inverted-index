   Four Daleks, accompanied by a device known as the "Genesis Ark", have
   emerged from the Void ship inside the Torchwood Institute's sphere
   chamber. The Cybermen who took control of Torchwood confront the
   Daleks, offering an alliance. The Daleks decline, and after a Dalek
   exterminates two Cybermen, the Cyber Leader declares war on the Daleks.

   A strike team from the parallel universe takes the Tenth Doctor to meet
   with Pete. After hearing that the parallel Earth has started warming at
   an unprecedented rate following the opening of the breach between the
   two Earths, the Doctor theorises this is the start of the process that
   will lead to both planets falling into the Void.

   In the sphere chamber, the Doctor realises that the four Daleks are the
   enigmatic Cult of Skaro, and allows the Cybermen to enter and attack
   the Daleks. Mickey accidentally activates the Ark while escaping with
   the Doctor, Pete and Rose. Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. Pete saves
   Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes
   everyone to the control room. Outside, the Ark - a prison ship built by
   the Time Lords to imprison the Daleks - opens. Millions of Daleks pour
   out and begin exterminating humans and Cybermen on the ground.

   The Doctor explains that if he opens the breach and reverses it, anyone
   who has travelled between the two separate worlds will be pulled in,
   including Rose, Mickey and Pete. The Doctor sends them along with
   Jackie to the parallel universe. Rose jumps back to help the Doctor.
   The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as
   the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled into the Void, but the Cult of Skaro
   escapes using a temporal shift. Rose loses her grip and starts to fall
   towards the Void, but at the last second, Pete transports Rose back to
   the parallel universe as the breach is closed. She becomes extremely
   upset upon learning that there is no way back.

   Some time later, Rose has a dream where she hears the Doctor's voice
   calling her. The Tylers follow the voice to a remote bay in Norway
   where a holographic image of the Doctor appears. He tells Rose he is
   using the energy of a supernova to transmit to her via one last small
   breach between universes. Rose breaks down in tears and tells the
   Doctor that she loves him; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the
   breach seals completely and the Doctor's image disappears. As he gets
   back to piloting the TARDIS, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding
   dress standing inside, demanding to know where she is, leaving him
   baffled and confused.
