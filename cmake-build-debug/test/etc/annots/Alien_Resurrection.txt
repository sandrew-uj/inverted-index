   Two hundred years after the events of Alien 3, United Systems Military
   scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen
   Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before
   her death. The Xenomorph queen's DNA has been combined with Ripley's,
   so the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract
   the embryo, raise it, and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive
   for further study. As a result of the Xenomorphs' DNA inside her, the
   clone has enhanced strength and reflexes, somewhat acidic blood, and a
   psychic link with the Xenomorphs. Additionally, the Xenomorph's genetic
   memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.

   A group of mercenaries consisting of Elgyn, Johner, Christie, Vriess,
   Hillard, and Call arrives at Auriga on their ship Betty. They deliver
   several kidnapped humans in stasis. The military scientists use the
   humans as hosts for the aliens, raising several adult Xenomorphs for
   study.

   The Betty crew soon encounters Ripley 8. Annalee Call recognizes her
   name and tries to kill her, suspecting that Ripley 8 may be used to
   create Xenomorphs, but the creatures have already been cloned. The now
   mature Xenomorphs, being aware of their blood's acidic properties from
   the aforementioned genetic memory, escape confinement by killing off
   one of their own to use its acidic blood to burn through their
   enclosures. They then capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman and kill a second
   scientist. They damage the Auriga and kill some of those people who
   failed to evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Another crew
   member is captured and cocooned for eggmorphing. Military scientist Dr.
   Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to
   return to Earth. Realizing that this will unleash the Xenomorphs on
   Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a Marine named Distephano, and
   surviving Xenomorph host Purvis, decide to head for the Betty and use
   it to destroy the Auriga. Along the way, Ripley 8 discovers a
   laboratory containing the grotesque results of the previous seven
   failed attempts to clone Ellen Ripley. The surviving one begs Ripley 8
   to euthanise her; she complies and then incinerates the lab and its
   contents.

   As the group makes their way through the damaged ship, they swim
   through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two Xenomorphs. One is
   killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen,
   the Xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to
   kill the Xenomorph, so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the
   group, Call is revealed to be an auton, an improved version of a human
   created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Auriga's
   systems, Call sets it on a collision course with Earth, hoping to
   destroy the Xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route
   and directs the Xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a
   Xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already
   aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort
   the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to
   his chest just as the Xenomorph embryo that he is carrying bursts
   through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing
   them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile Xenomorph.

   Ripley is taken to the Alien nest, where she finds Gediman, still alive
   and partially cocooned. The Alien Queen, having developed a uterus as a
   result of her genetic contamination with Ripley 8, gives birth to a
   Xenomorph with overtly human traits. Unable to bond with the Queen, the
   hybrid Xenomorph recognizes Ripley 8 as its mother, so it kills the
   Alien Queen and Gediman. Ripley 8 takes advantage of the distraction to
   escape and makes her way to the Betty.

   The "Newborn Alien" reaches the Betty and attacks Call, killing
   Distephano when he tries to help her. Ripley 8 finds her way onto the
   ship and saves Call by distracting the hybrid. Using her acidic blood,
   Ripley 8 melts a hole in a window and pushes the hybrid towards it. The
   decompression violently blows the creature through the hole and out
   into space, killing it as Ripley 8 tearfully watches on.

   The countdown on the Auriga continues as the survivors escape in the
   Betty. The Auriga collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. As
   they look down at Earth, Call asks what Ripley 8 wants to do next. "I
   don't know. I'm a stranger here myself", she replies.
