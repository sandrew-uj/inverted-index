   Dune: The Machine Crusade moves forward into the center of the
   Butlerian Jihad, described in the first book of the trilogy, Dune: The
   Butlerian Jihad. Leading the movement is the ex-slave and ex-machine
   trustee Grand Patriarch Iblis Ginjo. However, Iblis appears more
   interested in politics and his own personal legacy than in the Jihad.

   Vorian Atreides, despite the long life given to him by his father, the
   Titan Agamemnon, begins to show the vestiges of wanting to settle down
   after visiting the planet Caladan, and meeting Leronica Tergiet, who is
   to become his long-term concubine.

   Xavier Harkonnen manages to free Ix from the thinking machines and must
   eventually make the ultimate sacrifice that will tarnish his name.

   The robot Erasmus continues with his enlightening human
   experimentation, and makes a curious bet with the Omnius entity on
   Corrin, where he claims he can raise a human being to be orderly and
   civilized like a machine. This child is Gilbertus Albans, the first
   true Mentat.

   Omnius himself suffers badly from a computer virus created by Vorian
   and spread unwittingly by his old companion Seurat.

   On Ginaz, the aging Zon Noret is killed in a training accident by a mek
   called Chirox, a captured and reprogrammed fighting machine. Though
   Noret did not live to pass on his skills to the other Ginaz
   mercenaries, Chirox remained to train them into the greatest of all
   mercenaries, the Swordmasters, who will be the ultimate fighting force
   against the thinking machines.

   On the planet of Poritrin, Norma Cenva becomes a successful inventor
   whose research and inventions on shields and spacefolding technology
   aids the League's war efforts against the machines. However, her
   benefactor Tio Holtzman takes credit for her research. Meanwhile, the
   Zensunni slave Ishmael petitions Duke Niko Bludd for better conditions
   for the slaves and recognition for their role in constructing a decoy
   fleet during the successful defense of Poritin. As punishment, he is
   separated from his wife and daughters and reassigned to Cenva's
   laboratories. Ishmael's devout religious pacifism clashes with Aliid's
   militancy, destroying their friendship.

   Norma leaves the world just in time to avoid a slave uprising during
   which Aliid, unaware of the consequences, fires a lasgun into a
   Holtzman personal shield. The resulting explosion wipes out Tio
   Holtzman's labs; the slave revolt is eventually brutally crushed.
   Ishmael manages to escape offworld with a hundred slaves including his
   older daughter Chamal and her husband Rafael by forcing the Tlulaxa Tuk
   Keedair to fly the on Norma's prototype spacefolding ship to the lonely
   desert world of Arrakis.

   Meanwhile, Norma, due to her heritage as daughter of the main Sorceress
   of Rossak Zufa Cenva, finally taps into her latent powers under great
   pressure (precipitated by her capture and subsequent torture by the
   Titan Xerxes) to become the spearhead of humanity. She envisions a
   future in which massive ships transport goods and humans
   instantaneously across the universe, using the Holtzman effect to fold
   space. Norma's ships are the first of what will later be known as
   heighliners, and her family uses their monopoly on such travel to found
   the Spacing Guild.

   On Arrakis, Ishmael and his followers struggle to survive on the desert
   world. They are saved after Keedair alerts the followers of Selim, who
   are also Zensunni, to their presence. Selim's followers welcome the
   former Poritrin slaves into their number and the two communities merge
   to become the Free Men of Arrakis.

   Finally, the remaining Titans take their chance becoming independent
   from their machine master Omnius on the planet of Bela Tegeuse.
