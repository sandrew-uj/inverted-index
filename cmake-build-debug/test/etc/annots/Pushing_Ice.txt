   Pushing Ice begins in the distant future, where the elected rulers of
   the "Congress of the Lindblad Ring" gather to decide on a suitable
   ceremony to honour a woman they consider responsible for the
   technological advancement and territorial expansion of the future human
   race, Bella Lind. To explain her role, the chronology is then pushed
   back to the early days of humanity's manned exploration of the solar
   system, where it is explained that Lind is the captain of the
   Rockhopper, a spacecraft used for mining cometary ice. While on a
   routine mission, Lind is informed that Saturn's moon Janus has deviated
   from its normal orbit, and is accelerating out of the solar system. The
   Rockhopper, deemed the only ship capable of catching up to Janus, is
   asked to undertake the task of pursuing the moon, sending back as much
   information as possible before being forced to turn back by the
   limitations of fuel and supplies. However, on their approach to the
   moon, revealed to be a camouflaged alien spacecraft, Lind and her crew
   are caught in the field of the ship's inertialess drive, causing them
   to travel farther and faster than expected, and beyond their capacity
   to return to Earth. Realising their predicament, the crew decide to
   land on the moon and attempt to survive the flight out of the Solar
   System, wherever it may take them. Eventually it becomes apparent that
   the ship is heading towards Spica, a close binary pair in the
   constellation of Virgo.

   At one point before the landing, Bella's closest friend and
   subordinate, Svetlana Barseghian, pushes for Bella to turn the ship
   around while there is still a chance to return to Earth. Bella decides
   that turning back is too dangerous, angering Svetlana, who then leads a
   mutiny and, after the ship lands, exiles Bella to a structure set apart
   from the main colony. The novel traces the life of the colony for many
   years as they try to eke out an existence on Janus and determine why it
   is moving through space. They work out a way of deriving power from
   some alien technology they find, and slowly start to improve their
   living conditions.

   They eventually arrive at a vast megastructure where they meet an alien
   species, called 'Fountainheads'. The encounter with the benevolent
   aliens improves the colonists' situation dramatically. The alien
   presence is played poorly by Svetlana who loses control of the colony
   to Bella. Bella does not exile Svetlana, even if she chooses a form of
   self-exile.

   The Fountainheads are able to rejuvenate humans, healing injuries and
   making them younger. The only restriction is that they cannot heal
   brain damage without the patient losing part of his/her personality.
   Bella and several others undergo rejuvenation to make themselves
   younger. Those that are rejuvenated still age, but more slowly. Another
   several decades go by as the Fountainheads and the humans co-exist. The
   Fountainheads are trading advanced technology with the colony in
   exchange for drilling rights on Janus, whose core is a vast energy
   resource.

   The Fountainheads warn Bella of the arrival of another, repulsive (by
   human standards) race called Musk Dogs that will infect the colony and
   tear it apart in an effort to get at Janus' core. When they arrive,
   Svetlana meets with the Musk Dogs and trades with them, she tries to
   regain control of the colony, but her actions set off a chain of events
   that destroys Janus and requires everyone to evacuate. Svetlana, with
   the assistance of the Fountainheads, leaves the structure through the
   gap created by the explosion. Pictures from her ship reveal the
   structure to be a Torus the size of a planetary system, with part of
   the structure missing at its center (believed to be the Spicans'
   quarters). Bella dies during the evacuation of Janus, but her body is
   nonetheless brought along with the evacuating colony. Her body remains
   in stasis for decades, waiting for the Fountainheads to restore her to
   life; she eventually awakens to learn that a new human colony has been
   established elsewhere in the structure.
