   Eon has been studying the ancient art of Dragon Magic for four years,
   hoping he'll be selected as apprentice to a Dragoneye. Dragoneyes are
   the human links to the twelve dragons of good fortune, who provide
   energy to the earth. However, circumstance does not favour Eon; he is a
   cripple and despised by the trainers and other candidates for the
   ceremony. They believe his disability embodies bad luck and try to
   distance themselves, all except a boy named Dillon who is also bullied
   for his small size. Eon's master, Heuris Brannon, places all his hope
   and dwindling wealth into his pupil, who is able to see all twelve
   dragons in minds' sight. This feat is almost unheard of and they pray
   that the ascending dragon this cycle, who is the Keeper of Ambition,
   will be drawn by the enormous power demonstrated. However, Eon has a
   dark secret unbeknownst to all but himself and his master; he is
   actually Eona, a sixteen-year-old girl who has been living a lie in
   order for the chance to become a Dragoneye. It is forbidden for females
   to practice the Dragon Magic; this is due to common belief that the
   female eye, so practised in looking at itself, cannot see other things
   in life with true clarity. If discovered, 'Eon' faces a terrible death.

   The choosing day comes all too quickly and the corrupted Rat Dragoneye,
   Lord Ido, has seized dominance over the council. He revokes the current
   practise of ceremonial performances and instead brings back the combat
   of old. The bloodthirsty crowds approve, but this just adds to the
   mounting misfortune Eona has to bear. Not only is she given the unlucky
   number of death, 4, but she has to face off with the one out of the two
   trainers who bears a grudge against her.

   Against the odds, the Rat Dragon chooses her friend Dillon, the
   smallest of the bunch. Here, it appears as though the protagonist has
   failed and her master's wealth is all lost; however, as the remaining
   candidates proceed to the arena to bow to the Emperor, the Mirror
   Dragon, which has been lost for five hundred years, returns. It chooses
   Eona, who becomes a Lord due to the absence of a current Mirror
   Dragoneye. Much to the fury of Lord Ido, all the dragons bow to the
   Mirror Dragon, including his. This is impossible because his is the
   ascendant dragon, but the message is clear; the Mirror Dragon, the
   Keeper of Truth, holds power over all the other dragons. To discourage
   those who oppose him, Ido poisons Heuris Brannon, Eona's appointed
   proxy (Eona's adviser until she is of age).

   Meanwhile, the country grows increasingly restless. A battle is about
   the break out between the Emperor and one of his brothers, High Lord
   Sethon, who wishes to make a claim for the throne. Lord Ido has allied
   himself with Sethon and as the Emperor ages, it is clear that the
   empire will soon be under civil war. The Emperor and his heir, Prince
   Kygo, attempt to use the return of the Mirror Dragon as a good omen for
   their reign. This throws Eona into the midst of their struggle for
   power. She panics, without knowledge as for whom to trust except her
   close friend Lady Dela (born a man but who is a woman in spirit) and
   Dela's bodyguard, the islander Ryko.

   Tension mounts and soon the battle begins. Eona finds herself in
   trouble; Ido discovers her true gender and her dragon fades and then
   disappears altogether. When talking to Dillon she realises that she
   does not have her dragon's name and thus cannot communicate properly.
   She consults the palace professor/librarian, who cannot find the red
   folio of the Mirror Dragon. Eona suspects Lord Ido and realises he has
   masterminded his own plan, killing all other Dragoneyes and apprentices
   in a bid for more power. In his library she meets an almost insane
   Dillon who finds both the red folio and another black folio, detailing
   how it is possible to create a 'String of Pearls', with 2 Dragoneyes
   harnessing the power of the normal 12. She puts the pieces together and
   is horrified to find that Ido wishes for the two of them to be the only
   two Dragoneyes left alive. However, Dillon takes off with the black
   folio as Eona saves Ryko from the pain caused by a dragon-powered
   hallucination.

   Prince Kygo flees and his baby brother, the Emperor's only other heir,
   is killed by Lord Sethon. In desperation the wounded Dela, limping Eona
   and injured Ryko try to escape but Ido orders his men to find them.
   Dela continues decoding the red folio, which is written in Women's
   Script, for Eona's dragon's name. As the warfare escalates and all
   seems to be lost in this final confrontation, Dela screams out that the
   dragon's name is her name; Eona. She summons her dragon, the Queen of
   the Heavens, and they are united at last, with Eona's crippled leg
   healing in the process. Together the Mirror Dragon and Dragoneye force
   compassion upon Ido and the trio make their escape to the river.
