   A century prior to the start of the game, the Kushan, humanoid
   inhabitants of the desert planet Kharak, discovered a spaceship buried
   in the sands, which holds a stone map marking Kharak and another planet
   across the galaxy labelled "Hiigara", meaning "home". The discovery
   united the clans of Kharak, who knew they were not indigenous to Kharak
   and craved to solve the mystery of how they came to this hostile
   planet. Together, they spent the next century developing and
   building a giant mothership that would carry 600,000 people to Hiigara,
   with neuroscientist Karan S'jet neurally wired into the ship as Fleet
   Command to replace an unsustainably large crew. The game opens with
   the maiden voyage of the mothership, testing the hyperspace drive which
   teleports the fleet to a new destination. Instead of the support ship
   that was expected to be there, the mothership finds a hostile alien
   fleet. After defeating them, the mothership returns to Kharak, to
   discover that the planet has been razed by another alien fleet, and
   that only the 600,000 migrants in suspended animation have
   survived. A captured enemy captain claims that the Kharak genocide
   was the consequence of their violation of a 4,000-year-old treaty
   between the interstellar Taiidan Empire and the Kushan, which forbids
   the latter from developing hyperspace technology.

   After destroying the remnants of both alien fleets, the nascent Kushan
   fleet sets out for Hiigara, intent on reclaiming their ancient
   homeworld. Their multi-stage journey across the galaxy takes them
   through asteroid fields, a giant nebula, a ship graveyard and several
   Taiidan outposts. Along the way, they fight other descendants of their
   Hiigaran ancestors who have turned to piracy. They also meet the
   Bentusi, a race of traders, who sell them advanced technology. After
   discovering that the Bentusi have given aid to the exiles, the Taiidan
   attempt to destroy them, but are stopped by the Kushan fleet. The
   Bentusi then reveal that the Kushan had once ruled their own empire,
   before being destroyed by the Taiidan and exiled from Hiigara. In
   gratitude for the Kushan's intervention, they promise to summon the
   Galactic Council to consider the Kushan's claim to Hiigara.

   As their journey continues, the Kushan fleet gives sanctuary to the
   Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his help, they rally a rebellion to
   distract the Taiidan fleets. He aids them in penetrating the
   Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet led
   by the Taiidan emperor. The emperor manages to knock Karan into a coma
   for the duration of the battle, but the combined Kushan and rebel
   fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives
   shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, a lush
   world in contrast to the desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make
   landfall, Karan insists that she be the last one to set foot on the
   planet.
