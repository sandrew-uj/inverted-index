   Underhill, a seller of "Mechanicals" (unthinking robots that perform
   menial tasks) in the small town of Two Rivers, is startled to find a
   competitor's store on his way home. The competitors are not humans but
   are small black robots who appear more advanced than anything Underhill
   has encountered before. They describe themselves as "Humanoids".

   Disturbed at his encounter, Underhill rushes home to discover that his
   wife has taken in a new lodger, a mysterious old man named Sledge. In
   the course of the next day, the new mechanicals have appeared
   everywhere in town. They state that they only follow the Prime
   Directive: "to serve and obey and guard men from harm". Offering their
   services free of charge, they replace humans as police officers, bank
   tellers, and more, and eventually drive Underhill out of business.
   Despite the Humanoids' benign appearance and mission, Underhill soon
   realizes that, in the name of their Prime Directive, the mechanicals
   have essentially taken over every aspect of human life. No humans may
   engage in any behavior that might endanger them, and every human action
   is carefully scrutinized. Suicide is prohibited. Humans who resist the
   Prime Directive are taken away and lobotomized, so that they may live
   happily under the direction of the humanoids.

   Underhill learns that his lodger Sledge is the creator of the Humanoids
   and is on the run from them. Sledge explains that 60 years earlier he
   had discovered the force of "rhodomagnetics" on the planet Wing IV and
   that his discovery resulted in a war that destroyed his planet. In his
   grief, Sledge designed the humanoids to help humanity and be
   invulnerable to human exploitation. However, he eventually realized
   that they had instead taken control of humanity, in the name of their
   Prime Directive, to make humans happy.

   The Humanoids are spreading out from Wing IV to every human occupied
   planet to implement their Prime Directive. Sledge and Underhill attempt
   to stop the humanoids by aiming a rhodomagnetic beam at Wing IV but
   fail. The humanoids take Sledge away for surgery. He returns with no
   memory of his prior life, stating that he is now happy under the
   humanoids' care. Underhill is driven home by the humanoids, sitting
   "with folded hands," as there is nothing left to do.
