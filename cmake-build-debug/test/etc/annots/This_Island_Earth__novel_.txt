   At Ryberg Instrument Corporation, engineer Cal Meacham has received a
   quartet of bead-like devices that are meant to replace the condensers
   that he ordered. Thinking it a joke, he tests them anyway and finds
   that they work just as well as what he had ordered. He orders more and
   with them gets a catalogue filled with electronic apparatus completely
   unfamiliar to him. His interest piqued, he orders the parts necessary
   to build what the catalog calls an interociter.

   When he turns the completed interociter on he confronts a man who
   invites him to join a group called Peace Engineers. Knowing that he
   would not refuse, the group sends a pilotless airplane to pick him up
   and take him to a small village/factory complex in a valley north of
   Phoenix, Arizona. He is greeted by Dr. Ruth Adams, a psychologist who
   seems to be afraid of something. Dr. Warner, the man he spoke with over
   the interociter, tells him that he will be in charge of the interociter
   assembly plant. He also meets Ole Swenberg, who was his roommate in
   college.

   Six months later he meets the Chief Engineer, Mr. Jorgasnovara, who
   describes the Peace Engineers in terms reminiscent of the Babbage
   Society in Michael F. Flynn's novel In the Country of the Blind. Later
   he overhears Jorgasnovara's thoughts through the interociter in his
   laboratory. One night he and Ruth discover that the interociters are
   being shipped out, not by truck, but by spaceship. Again overhearing
   Jorgasnovara's thoughts, Cal learns that the Peace Engineers are
   involved in an interstellar war.

   Cal believes that all of Earth should be participating in the war that
   the Peace Engineers have somehow gotten us into, so he gathers
   documents and samples and takes a small airplane to fly to Washington.
   Halfway to his destination he and his plane are snatched out of the air
   by a spaceship and taken to the moon. There Jorgasnovara tells Cal,
   Ruth, and Ole that Peace Engineers is actually run by his people,
   aliens called Llanna, and that the Llanna are engaged in a
   millennia-long, intergalactic war with people called Guarra. Earth is
   now being used in that war as certain small Pacific islands were used
   in World War II.

   Returning to Earth, Cal, Ruth, and Ole find the plant being sabotaged.
   The Llannans decide to abandon it, but before they leave, Cal and Ruth
   discover that Ole is a Guarra sleeper agent. As a consequence of the
   interociter-mediated battle that destroys Ole and his non-human
   henchmen Jorgasnovara dies.

   Cal and Ruth are taken to Jorgasnovara's home world and are told that
   Earth is to be abandoned completely, that the Guarra will destroy it,
   as they have destroyed so many other worlds. Cal protests but the
   Llannan Council tells him that their war computers have predicted that
   they would not defend Earth. But the Guarran war computers would tell
   the Guarra the same thing, so, Cal tells the Council, the best tactic
   is to do what the Guarra do not expect. The Llannans then agree to
   defend Earth and Cal and Ruth look forward to returning home.
