   Two college students, Chuck van Chider and his friend Jerry Courtenay,
   accidentally invent a device that can transport them through space,
   powered by a substance called "Cheddite", which is created by
   irradiating Cheddar cheese.

   Chuck and Jerry, their apparent mutual love interest Sally Goodfellow
   and their janitor-turned-KGB spy Old John find themselves transported
   to Titan, a moon of Saturn, where they must contend with the native
   Titanians. Later, through a bizarre chain of events, they are flung
   into the far reaches of the galaxy, where they become involved in an
   intergalactic war that could change the universe forever. By the end of
   the novel, they have returned to Earth, where Chuck and Jerry are
   revealed as gay lovers.^[3]
