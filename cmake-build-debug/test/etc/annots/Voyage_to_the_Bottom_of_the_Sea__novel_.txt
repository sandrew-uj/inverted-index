   Under the command of Captain Lee Crane and with Admiral Harriman
   Nelson, Vice-Admiral B. J. Crawford, Congressman Llewellyn Parker, and
   psychologist Susan Hiller aboard, the nuclear-powered submarine USOS.
   Seaview goes under the Arctic ice for a shakedown cruise. Partway
   through the cruise the crew find that the ice is melting and when
   Seaview surfaces they see that the sky appears to be on fire. Radio
   communication is extremely difficult, but they get a request to come to
   New York, where the UN is holding a meeting of top scientists. After
   rescuing a man, Alvarez, from an ice floe, they head south.

   With help from Vice-Admiral Crawford, Admiral Nelson collates
   observations and carries out calculations whose answers tell him what
   he needs to do. He determines that the inner Van Allen radiation belt
   has caught fire, pulling air up from the overheating atmosphere. To
   stop the fire, to save all life on Earth, Seaview must launch a missile
   at a precise moment from a point NW of Guam and have the missile spew
   electrically-charged lampblack into the outer radiation belt. But first
   the admiral must attend the meeting in New York.

   At the United Nations the world-renowned scientist, Dr. Emilio Zucco,
   insists that the fire will simply burn itself out and should be left
   alone. Nelson disagrees, but there's no time to argue and recalculate
   the figures. While Congressman Parker distracts the audience, Nelson
   and his crew make a break for it and take Seaview out to sea.

   South across the Atlantic Seaview drives, pausing only long enough for
   the crew to tap an undersea telephone cable in a failed attempt to get
   through to the President. Then Seaview charges onward, through the
   Straits of Magellan and into the Pacific. On their way to the launch
   point they have to contend with a freshly-laid mine field, a hostile
   destroyer, an attack sub, and a gargantuan octopus, not to mention an
   onboard saboteur. Nonetheless they reach the launch point in time,
   thwart the saboteur, and succeed in carrying out their mission. They
   launch the missile and Earth is saved.
