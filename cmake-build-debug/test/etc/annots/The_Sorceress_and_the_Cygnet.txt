   Corleu of the Wayfolk stands out from his kin due to his blond hair and
   obsession with his people's myths, according to which a war was once
   fought between the Cygnet, the Gold King, the Blind Lady, the Dancer,
   and the Warlock, resulting in the Cygnet's victory and the others'
   exile. These characters are now commemorated in the constellations and
   the patron signs of the regional hold settlements. Today, the sign of
   the Cygnet is borne by Ro Holding, and the remaining signs by the other
   holdings under its rule.

   When Corleu and his companions, including his beloved Tiel, are
   bespelled and trapped in a timeless swamp, his knowledge enables him to
   cross into the parallel world where the mythic figures exist and seek
   help. Meeting a tinker who is actually the fearsome Gold King, he is
   tasked with seeking the Heart of the Cygnet, which he is told might
   release his people from their limbo. The King's true motive is to free
   his ancient allies and turn the tables on the Cygnet in their age-old
   war.

   With the aid of the sorceress Nyx Ro, estranged heir to Ro Holding,
   whom he must keep ignorant of his goal, Corleu begins his journey. He
   encounters the Fire Bear in its lair, catches the Blood Fox by its
   shadow, and evades a female warrior, Meguet, whose fate seems bound
   with his. At each step of the journey another legendary character is
   awakened; the Blind Lady, the Dancer, and the Warlock.

   The Ro clan works against the questers, aware that if the Gold King
   prevails and the Cygnet falls, the balance keeping peace among the
   holds will be upset, and all who live will be doomed. Their efforts are
   continually countered by the wily king, and all the players gather for
   the endgame in a final confrontation at Ro Holding, Nyx's home.
