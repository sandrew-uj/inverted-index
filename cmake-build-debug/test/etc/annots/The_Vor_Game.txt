   Miles Vorkosigan graduates from the Academy, but is upset to learn he
   is being sent to replace the weather officer at the Empire's winter
   infantry training base on remote Kyril Island. He is somewhat mollified
   by the placement officer's explanation that the posting is to see if he
   can handle the discipline and military routine. If he can, he will be
   reassigned to a more desirable posting. However, he cannot help but get
   into trouble.

   Miles refuses to obey what he deems a criminal order by the base
   commander, who has him arrested for mutiny, and as he is high Vor,
   technically treason. He is quickly returned to the capital and
   sequestered in the bowels of Imperial Security (ImpSec) by Simon
   Illyan, who, along with his father, concludes that Miles had behaved
   correctly, but has also gained notoriety for his insubordinate action
   and cannot expect to serve in any branch of the Imperial Service, with
   one possible exception. Miles' father, Aral Vorkosigan, persuades
   Illyan to transfer Miles to ImpSec, despite Illyan's and Miles'
   reluctance.

   Miles, sent to help evaluate the Hegen Hub (and remain conveniently out
   of the way), is framed for murder and arrested. While in custody, he is
   startled to find Emperor Gregor in the same cell. Gregor tells him that
   he ran away during a visit to Komarr and joined a merchant ship's crew
   as a navigator, but was then left behind without being paid at
   Consortium Station and jailed for vagrancy. Miles attempts to extricate
   Gregor, but is soon up to his neck in a mysterious plot involving an
   amoral femme fatale, his homicidal former Kyril Island commanding
   officer, and Hub power politics. Miles encounters his Dendarii
   mercenary friends and, after once again outmaneuvering their leader,
   Admiral Oser, resumes command under his Admiral Naismith persona. He is
   able to rescue Gregor from the femme fatale (an extremely devious,
   short mercenary leader herself) and get the mutually suspicious Hegen
   Hub planets to present a united defense to repel a surprise attack by a
   Cetagandan invasion fleet, with timely help from Barrayaran
   reinforcements jointly commanded by his father and Gregor.

   Afterward, Gregor and ImpSec decide to put the Dendarii on permanent
   secret retainer for covert missions, with Miles officially installed as
   liaison.
