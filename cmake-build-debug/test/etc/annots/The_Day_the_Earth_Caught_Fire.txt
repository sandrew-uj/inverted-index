   A lone man walks through the sweltering streets of a deserted London.
   The film then goes back several months. Peter Stenning (Judd) had been
   an up-and-coming journalist with the Daily Express, but since a divorce
   threw his life into disarray, he has been drinking too much (one of his
   lines is "Alcoholics of the press, unite!") and his work has
   suffered. His editor (Christiansen) has begun giving him lousy
   assignments. Stenning's only friend, Bill Maguire (McKern), is a
   veteran Fleet Street reporter who offers him encouragement and
   occasionally covers for him by writing his copy.

   Meanwhile, after the Soviet Union and the United States accidentally
   detonate simultaneous nuclear bomb tests, strange meteorological events
   begin to affect the globe. Stenning is sent to the British Met Office
   to obtain temperature data, and while there he meets Jeanie (Munro), a
   young typist who is temporarily acting as telephonist. They "meet
   cute", trading insults; later, they fall in love.

   Stenning then discovers that the weapons tests have had a massive
   effect on Earth. He asks Jeannie to help him get any relevant
   information. It becomes apparent that Earth's nutation has been
   altered by 11 degrees, affecting the climatic zones and changing the
   pole and the equator. The increasing heat has caused water to evaporate
   and mists to cover Britain, and a solar eclipse occurs days ahead of
   schedule. Later, characters realise that the orbit of the Earth has
   been disrupted and the planet is spiralling in towards the Sun.

   The government imposes a state of emergency and starts rationing water
   and supplies. People start evacuating the cities. Scientists conclude
   that the only way to bring Earth back into a safe orbit is to detonate
   a series of nuclear bombs in western Siberia. Stenning, Maguire, and
   Jeanie gather at a bar to listen to the radio broadcast of the event.
   The bombs are detonated, and the shock wave causes dust to fall from
   the bar's ceiling.

   At the newspaper print room, two versions of the front page have been
   prepared: one reads "World Saved", the other "World Doomed". The film
   ends without revealing which one will be published, and in the words
   that talking Stenning where "humanity will recover after all this
   horror.".
