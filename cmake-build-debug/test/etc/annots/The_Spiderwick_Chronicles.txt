   The Spiderwick Chronicles is a series of children's books by Tony
   DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. They chronicle the adventures of the Grace
   children, twins Simon and Jared and their older sister Mallory, after
   they move into the Spiderwick Estate and discover a world of fairies
   that they never knew existed. The first book, The Field Guide, was
   published in 2003 and then followed by The Seeing Stone (2003),
   Lucinda's Secret (2003), The Ironwood Tree (2004), and The Wrath of
   Mulgarath (2004). Several companion books have been published including
   Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You
   (2005), Notebook for Fantastical Observations (2005), and Care and
   Feeding of Sprites (2006). A second series, entitled Beyond the
   Spiderwick Chronicles includes The Nixie's Song (2007), A Giant Problem
   (2008), and The Wyrm King (2009).

   A feature film adaptation, also titled The Spiderwick Chronicles, was
   produced by Nickelodeon Movies and premiered on February 14, 2008; an
   accompanying video game was released in early February 2008.
