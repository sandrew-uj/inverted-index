   On August 23, 2029, the asteroid 99942 Apophis collides with Earth,
   destroying human civilization and turning the world into a wasteland.
   Survivors come together to form settlements around oases and other
   practical or habitable locations, while the wastes are plagued by
   various bandits clans, and mutants, who attack all normal humans in a
   voracious horde.

   In 2135, former U.S. Marine Lieutenant Nicholas Raine emerges from an
   underground shelter called an Ark, 106 years after being put into
   stasis. These underground shelters are the direct result of the Eden
   Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks,
   containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth
   to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization
   after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful
   than hoped, as Raine's Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all
   of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up
   alone with no specific goal in mind.

   Raine enters the surface, where he is immediately attacked by bandits
   but is saved by Dan Hagar (voiced by actor John Goodman), a local
   wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him
   that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the
   Authority, that considers itself the one true government of the
   wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine
   briefly aids Hagar's settlement and others in the local area by
   completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that
   the nanotrites injected into Raine's blood before he was sent into
   hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive
   the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority.
   Hagar believes Raine's continued presence is too dangerous for the
   settlement and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead.

   In Wellspring, Raine helps the town with various problems such as
   fighting off bandits, mutants, and ferrying supplies. Eventually, he
   comes into contact with Dr. Kvasir, an elderly scientist who previously
   worked for the Authority, who tells Raine about the inhumane
   experiments they were responsible for, such as the creation of the
   mutants. Kvasir puts him into contact with the Resistance, an armed
   anti-Authority group, where he is tasked with rescuing their leader,
   Captain Marshall, who has recently been imprisoned by the Authority.
   Raine again attracts attention from the Authority, forcing him to flee
   Wellspring and join the Resistance at their headquarters in Subway
   Town, where he earns the trust of the town and its tyrannical mayor,
   Redstone. He also learns what had happened in the past century from
   Captain Marshall, who is an Ark survivor himself. General Martin Cross,
   who was in charge of the Eden Project, sabotaged the operation shortly
   before 99942 Apophis struck the Earth by ensuring that only the Arks
   with people loyal to him were opened on schedule, with this first wave
   of Ark survivors eventually forming the Authority. The remaining Arks
   were supposed to stay underground forever in hibernation, including
   Raine's Ark, which surfaced only because its systems were damaged and
   it automatically rose to protect any surviving inhabitants.

   With the Authority beginning to forcefully expand its influence on the
   wasteland settlements, the Resistance is forced to act with the help of
   Raine who can recover data that shows the location of every Ark on the
   planet. Captain Marshall plans to use this data to activate all the
   Arks and form an army that can defeat the Authority, but the only way
   to do this is to transmit the data from Capital Prime, the main
   headquarters for the Authority. Alone, Raine fights his way through
   Capital Prime to transmit the Ark activation code, and the game
   concludes with all the remaining Arks simultaneously becoming active
   and surfacing.
