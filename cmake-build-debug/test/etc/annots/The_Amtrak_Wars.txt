   In AD 2989, a 17-year-old, newly qualified Amtrak pilot named Steve
   Brickman joins the Lady from Louisiana, a wagon-train in its first
   major assault on the Plainfolk Mutes. Thanks to the Mutes' deployment
   of sorcery, the wagon-train is defeated and forced to retreat. Brickman
   is taken prisoner by the Mutes but not killed, due to a prophetic
   vision of the clan's seer, Mr. Snow, which suggests Steve will be
   instrumental in the fulfilment of the Talisman Prophecy. This suggests
   a 'chosen one' called "Talisman" will arise to destroy the Federation
   and lead the Mutes to victorious domination of the world. Steve comes
   to admire and respect the Mutes; he falls in love with a "straight"
   (mutation-free) Mute woman named Clearwater and forges a bond of mutual
   respect with Mr. Snow's apprentice, Cadillac.

   Steve eventually escapes from the Mutes and returns to the Federation,
   but his account of his imprisonment and escape is deemed fantastical.
   Labelled a deserter, he is stripped of all rank and is publicly
   disgraced. Privately, Steve is recruited by the Federation's top-secret
   intelligence organisation, AMEXICO, and is sent on a new assignment to
   capture Cadillac, Clearwater, and Mr. Snow, who are deemed of interest
   to the Federation. Upon learning that Cadillac has used information
   from Steve to build a primitive glider and fly it to Ne-Issan as part
   of a weapons and intelligence exchange between the Mutes and Iron
   Masters, Steve decides to pursue the capture mission into Ne-Issan.
   During this mission, Steve's loyalties become further conflicted
   between his affinity with the Mutes and his birth allegiance to the
   Federation, and he begins a risky attempt to play both sides against
   the middle whilst he looks for a way to escape his enemies on both
   sides.

   Ultimately, the Talisman prophecy is fulfilled, at great cost.
