   The story is set in a contemporary Britain to the date of writing. It
   seems to start as the classic Good versus Evil tale, but as the
   characters are developed, the reader finds this view challenged. George
   is portrayed as far from Saintly, the Dragon elicits sympathy. The
   notions of good and evil are portrayed as the bureaucracy and
   legislation found in Heaven and Hell. Alongside this, time itself has
   commercial value and can be mined, exploited and traded like any other
   commodity. When George finds he isn't winning he enlists the aid of
   some minor Demons, who are on a holiday from Hell and left behind after
   a stop in Nashville.^[1]

   The Dragon was defeated in the original battle, but knows he was
   cheated by George and now wants to set the record straight. They carry
   on the battle by animating stolen statues. One of Holt's recurring
   characters from other novels makes an appearance in the form of Kurt
   Lindquist, an assassin.^[2] Various minor characters, such as clergymen
   who can't tell who side who is on, an animated statue of David and
   policemen that have the characteristics of the Keystone Cops.^[3]

   The main protagonist, albeit reluctant, Bianca Wilson has been
   commissioned by Birmingham City Council. She isn't given any direction
   and by luck she produces a sculpture of St George and the Dragon backed
   by money from Kawaguchiya Integrated Circuits. One morning she finds
   the dragon has disappeared from her sculpture. Throughout the story
   Bianca displays a disinterest for getting involved in the dispute
   between George and the Dragon.^[4]
