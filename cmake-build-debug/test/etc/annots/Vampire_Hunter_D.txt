   D wanders through a far-future post-nuclear war Earth that combines
   elements of pulp genres: western, science fiction, horror and
   Lovecraftian horror, dark fantasy, folklore and occult science. The
   planet, once terrified by the elegant but cruel Nobles (vampires),
   ancient demons, mutants and their technological creations, is now
   slowly returning to a semblance of order and human control--thanks in
   part to the decadence that brought about the downfall of the vampire
   race, to the continued stubbornness of frontier dwellers, and to the
   rise of a caste of independent hunters-for-hire who eliminate
   supernatural threats.

   Some time in 1999, a nuclear war occurred. The Nobility were vampires
   that planned for a possible nuclear war and sequestered all that was
   needed to rebuild civilization in their shelters. They use their
   science combined with magic to restore the world in their image. Nearly
   all magical creatures on Earth are genetically engineered by the
   Nobility to possess seemingly supernatural abilities, regeneration, and
   biological immortality, with a very small number being demons, gods,
   aliens, and extradimensional beings who survived the holocaust. Despite
   their technology being advanced enough to create a blood substitute as
   food, they still prefer to feed on humans. As such, they created a
   civilization where vampires and humans coexisted, eventually developing
   the planet into parklands and cities. The society eventually stagnates
   when vampire technology perfects scientific prophecy, which determines
   they are at their zenith of existence and thus are doomed to fall,
   overthrown by humans. The human race was also transformed at this time,
   with fear for the vampires being woven into their genetics, and the
   inability to remember vampire weaknesses such as garlic and crucifixes.

   Unlike vampires from traditional lore, the Nobility have the ability to
   reproduce sexually, although their offspring will permanently cease
   aging after reaching physical maturity, having inherited their vampire
   parent's immortality.
