   Professor Bullfinch has created a radio telescope ("dish") for the
   government which will try to determine if extraterrestrials are trying
   to contact Earth. When Danny sneaks into the observatory, he hears
   non-random sounds coming from space. He then must figure out how to
   translate the sounds.

   The observatory described in the book is similar to the real life SETI
   project, which Carl Sagan would also use later in his novel Contact.
