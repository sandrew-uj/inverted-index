   The Named opens with a prologue in which two children, Sera and Ethan,
   are running to witness a rare flower bloom. Ethan, at age four,
   recognizes his older sister's love for all things strange and
   otherworldly, and loves being included in her wonder. The moment of
   wonder is ruined by the appearance of a monster, Marduke, who murders
   10-year-old Sera. Ethan's scream marks the transition from the prologue
   to the first chapter, where 16-year-old Ethan laments the recurring
   nightmare he has about the death of his sister twelve years before.

   Ethan's life changed drastically after the death of his sister; his
   parents, Laura and Shaun, are mere shells of themselves. Laura suffers
   from severe depression while Shaun exists in a state of perpetual
   numbness. His only solace is his position in The Guardians of Time, a
   group of soldiers organized by the immortal Lorian, whose sole purpose
   is to defeat the goddess Lathenia and her Order of Chaos. The Order's
   soldiers exist to alter the course of history in order to benefit their
   goddess; the more chaos created in the past increases her strength in
   the present. Ethan and his friend and mentor Arkarian spent the
   majority of the twelve years since Sera's death in training and going
   on missions to the past to stop the Order from derailing history. Ethan
   and Arkarian are not only members of the Guard, but also Named by an
   ancient prophecy that predicts the final battle between the Guard and
   the Order.

   After years of devotion to the Guard, Ethan is rewarded with an
   apprentice. Should he train her well, he could be awarded the Guard's
   highest honor; the power of flight. His only concern is that is
   would-be apprentice is Isabel Beckett, the kid sister to his former
   best friend Matt. Isabel spent her childhood chasing after Ethan, Matt,
   and their friends, wishing to be included in their adventures while
   harboring a not-so-secret crush on Ethan. He remembers her as a pest,
   and knows that Matt, who believes Ethan is after his girlfriend, will
   make training difficult. After overcoming multiple difficulties,
   including accidentally showing one of his powers to his history
   teacher, Ethan and Isabel reconnect and form a strong friendship. They
   succeed on several missions, revealing other members of the Named along
   the way. Isabel's crush on Ethan grows and then dwindles as she gets
   closer with Arkarian, and her passion for the cause and her skills
   makes her a powerful member of the Named. With the prophecy slowly
   being fulfilled, more identities of the Order are made known. Ethan and
   Isabel learn that Marduke, the monster of Ethan's nightmares, is
   actually a member of the Order, who holds a vendetta against Shaun, a
   former member of the Named. In an effort to speed up the prophecy,
   Marduke challenges Shaun to a battle, where the members of the Named
   face off against Marduke and his best soldiers.

   In a battle between the Named and Marduke, it is revealed that Matt's
   girlfriend Rochelle is also a member of the Order, and was planted by
   Marduke to break up Matt and Ethan's friendship. In a moment of
   compassion, Isabel frees her from the battle, with a promise that
   Arkarian will protect her from the Order. Ethan successfully defeats
   Marduke, and the battle ends.
