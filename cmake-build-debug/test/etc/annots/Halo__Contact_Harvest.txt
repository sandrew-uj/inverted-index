   Contact Harvest takes place in the year 2524 in the Halo universe,
   where faster-than-light technology has allowed humanity to spread
   across the galaxy. The novel is an ensemble piece, with the action
   being narrated from human and alien Covenant viewpoints.^[4] After
   noticing the disappearances of ships around the remote agricultural
   colony Harvest, The United Nations Space Command sends Staff Sergeants
   Avery Johnson and Nolan Byrne to Harvest to raise a militia. The
   disappearances are revealed to be alien Kig-Yar vessels intercepting
   the ships in their search for relics left by the Forerunners, an
   ancient race sacred to the Kig-Yar and other members of the Covenant.
   Members of the vessel are shocked to discover that their instruments
   indicates hundreds of thousands of Forerunner relics on Harvest.
   Setting a trap for the hijackers, Johnson and Byrne engage the Covenant
   in combat. Another Covenant ship arrives, this one crewed by
   Jiralhanae. These troops, led by their chieftain Maccabeus, have been
   ordered to confirm the presence of the relics; despite the reservations
   of his nephew, Tartarus, Maccabeus agrees to parley with the humans on
   Harvest to secure the Forerunner relics. In the midst of the meeting in
   Harvest's gardens, the Covenant begin a firefight and peace talks are
   shattered.

   On the Covenant holy city of High Charity, two San 'Shyuum, the
   Minister of Fortitude and the Vice-Minister of Tranquility, plot to
   take the place of the three Prophet Hierarchs currently leading the
   Covenant. They visit the Philologist for blessings and advice. As
   Tranquility and Fortitude are meeting with the Philologist, the
   "Oracle", a Forerunner artificial intelligence named Mendicant Bias,
   awakens from dormancy. Mendicant Bias informs the San 'Shyuum that the
   "Forerunner artifacts" found at Harvest are actually the humans
   themselves, meaning that the Covenant's central teachings are false.
   The Minister of Fortitude realizes that the truth must never be
   revealed, lest the Covenant be torn apart.

   Back on Harvest, Johnson and his militia continue to resist the
   Covenant attack. Maccabeus is ordered to bombard the planet from space,
   but disobeys and launches a ground assault in an effort to recover the
   relics. Johnson and his team board an orbital platform to evacuate
   Harvest's population. Tartarus challenges Maccabeus for control of the
   Jiralhanae pack, killing his uncle and becoming the next leader. The
   human civilians and survivors of Harvest successfully evacuate the
   planet, while on High Charity, the Minister of Fortitude, Tranquility,
   and The Philologist become the new Prophet Hierarchs, and announce a
   war against humanity to suppress the truth they have learned.
