   Mercury Fur is set in a post-apocalyptic version of London's East End,
   where gang violence and drugs - in the form of hallucinogenic
   butterflies - terrorize the community. The protagonists are a gang of
   youths surviving by their wits. They deal the butterflies, selling them
   to their addicted customers from locations such as the now burnt-out
   British Museum. Their main source of income, however, is holding
   parties for wealthy clients in which their wildest, most amoral
   fantasies are brought to life.

   The play, during nearly two uninterrupted hours, centres on a party
   which revolves around the sadistic murder of a child, enacted according
   to the whims of a guest. The gang ultimately has to face the question
   of how far they are willing to go to save the people they love.
