   In Brooklyn in the summer of 1947, 11-year-old Michael Devlin (Peter
   Tambakis) witnesses a brutal beating of a Jewish shopkeeper by a local
   Irish street gang called the Falcons. Scared to go to the police,
   Michael tells his widowed mother (Lolita Davidovich) who only consoles
   him by telling him God will judge the guilty. With a heavy feeling of
   guilt still following the young boy, Michael reaches out to Rabbi Judah
   Hirsch (Stephen Rea) who had fled Czechoslovakia during World War II.
   An unlikely friendship evolves between the two characters as they bond
   over baseball and alluring tales of Jewish folklore like the book of
   Kabbalah which has the power to create miracles such as snow in August.
   As a fatherless child, Michael eventually grows to see the Rabbi as
   close friend and father figure--a relationship that ends up costing him
   his friends and brings unwanted attention from Frankie McMarthy (Adam
   MacDonald ) and the rest of the Falcon gang. The Falcons attack Rabbi
   Hirsch and later threaten Michael and his mother, demonstrating their
   outright disapproval of the relationship between a Jewish Rabbi and a
   Catholic family. Determined to finally have the courage to stand up
   against the gang, Michael goes to Rabbi Hirsch in the hospital to learn
   more about an ancient Jewish text and the ritual for summoning the
   Golem to help him serve justice and protect his loved ones.
