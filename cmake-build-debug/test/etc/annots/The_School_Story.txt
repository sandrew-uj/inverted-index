   As the novel begins, twelve-year-old Natalie is almost done writing a
   novel called The Cheater about a girl and her friends. It is uncommon,
   if not impossible, for someone her age to get published, but Natalie's
   best friend, Zoe Reisman, thinks The Cheater is good enough. Natalie
   wants her mother, Hannah Nelson, who works as an editor at Shipley
   Junior Books, to edit her manuscript, but she doesn't want her mother
   to find out that she wrote it. To accomplish this, Natalie uses the
   pseudonym Cassandra Day, and Zoe acts as her literary agent,
   fabricating the "Sherry Clutch Literary Agency". Zoe hides her identity
   by using her nickname, "Zee Zee", and pronouncing her last name
   differently. The girls decide to rent a cheap "instant office", then
   realize that they could use some adult help. They enlist a teacher at
   their school, Laura Clayton, to be their adviser, and together with the
   three form "The Publishing Club". Zoe gives Ms. Clayton $500 to pay for
   the office and services but feeling guilty, Ms. Clayton secretly pays
   for it herself and safely stores Zoe's money away in her bank account.

   Besides the girls' age disadvantage, the editor in chief at Shipley,
   "Lethal" Letha Springfield, adds complications. Seeing that The Cheater
   could prove to be a success, Letha takes over editing the manuscript.
   Zoe (speaking as Zee Zee) gets into an argument with her and states
   that Cassandra (Natalie) will only write with Hannah as her editor.
   Instead of obliging, Letha refuses and declares that the book will not
   be published by Shipley unless an apology is received. This problem is
   averted when Zoe sends a copy of the manuscript directly to Tom Morton,
   president of Shipley, along with a letter describing Cassandra's
   wishes. After reading (and loving) the story, Tom tells Letha to let
   Hannah handle it. Later, when the girls are offered a contract, they
   show it to Zoe's father, who is a lawyer, and they get Natalie's Uncle
   Fred to sign in place of her mother. After hearing the story from the
   girls, Zoe's father is extremely impressed with Ms. Clayton and calls
   to commend her. He also gets her to send him a bill for the office.
