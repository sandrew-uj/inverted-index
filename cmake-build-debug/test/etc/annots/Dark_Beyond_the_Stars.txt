   The story is told through the narrative of Sparrow, a crew member
   aboard the Astron, which is a multigenerational starship sent from
   Earth on a search for life on other planets throughout the Milky Way.
   Sparrow fell off a cliff during one planetside excursion and is
   stricken with amnesia. No one will discuss his past with him and the
   computer has restricted his data, reasoning that he should "look
   within" to fully recover. Sparrow struggles to revive his memory and
   familiarizes himself with the Astron, the crew, the enigmatic Captain
   Kusaka, the state of the ship and its mission; in which the search for
   life has lasted over 2000 years with no success.

   The ship has slowly shrunk from cannibalizing sealed off sections for
   parts and breaking apart from centuries of wear; meanwhile, the crew
   has dwindled from generations of selective breeding. The Captain wants
   to take the Astron to a section of the galaxy where stars are more
   numerous and older where planets are more likely to harbor life, but to
   do so they would have to cross the empty space between spiral arms they
   call "the Dark". Most members of the crew know that they will not
   survive the journey since it would take several centuries to cross and
   the ship would not make it with its current rate of attrition of their
   closed ecological system. But Captain Kusaka, who is immortal and
   obsessed with exploration, does not heed to the warnings and will do
   whatever it takes to complete the mission. As a result, the crew
   secretly try to plan a mutiny to seize control of the ship and return
   to Earth, the only place they know that harbors life.

   Sparrow refuses to join the mutiny with his friends against Kusaka, but
   is torn since he knows they won't survive the trip and that chances of
   finding life are almost nonexistent, thus making the mission futile but
   the Captain won't accept it. Things change when Sparrow slowly
   discovers that he is also immortal like the Captain, and that he has
   lived previous "lives" on the ship as the same man but with different
   names and his memories of every previous identity are erased every
   generation by orders of the Captain. He learns that he originally
   volunteered for the role to be the mirror for every crew to "remember
   what its like to be human"; since they've been isolated from the rest
   of humanity over the centuries the crew has formed their own
   collective-mind culture that's overly benign and incapable of harm
   since they regard life as the most precious thing in existence (also
   makes them reluctant to mutiny). Sparrow also learns that he was the
   first mutineer and Kusaka erased his memories to keep the crew in line
   and Sparrow from seizing control of the ship since the Astron's central
   computer only responds to the minds of the immortal crew members, and
   should they be removed the ship would not function and would drift
   through space forever.

   When they leave the last star system explored to enter "the Dark",
   Captain Kusaka tries to suppress the conspirators even though they are
   benign, but Sparrow gives them the resolution to fight when they
   realize that since the ship has traveled so far through relativistic
   time dilation, human civilization on Earth may have ceased to exist and
   that they may be the only known lifeforms left in the universe.
   Moreover, since the governments that sent them out no longer exist,
   Kusaka is no longer lawfully in command. In a last-ditch attempt at
   mutiny, most of the crew board shuttles and landers and leave the ship,
   preferring to die quickly in space than to venture into "the Dark" with
   Kusaka. Meanwhile, before the mutineers' life support fails, Sparrow
   fights Kusaka alone in a hidden room that holds the preserved remains
   of the original first generation crew. This triggers all of Sparrow's
   memories and past personalities to surface at once in a dissociative
   identity breakdown, which leads to the resurfacing of his original
   identity: Raymond Stone. In the ensuing fight Raymond fatally wounds
   Kusaka.

   With the mutiny over, Raymond takes command of the Astron and sets a
   course back to Earth, which takes 20 generations (400 years) to reach.
   During that time, Raymond watches the crew he has known age and die and
   recycled for mass on the ship as well as their descendant crews come
   and go, thus making him realize the value of life and the price of
   immortality.

   The story ends when the Astron, after 2500 ship-years (or approximately
   17,000 time-dilated Julian years as calculated earlier), finally
   returns to an uninhabited Earth for the descendants of the original
   crew and Raymond to repopulate. While they are celebrating, they are
   shocked to discover an alien ship has also found Earth.
