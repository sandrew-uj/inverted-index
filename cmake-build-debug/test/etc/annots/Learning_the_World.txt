   The novel is a first contact story, following the generation ship But
   the Sky, My Lady! The Sky! as it approaches the Destiny Star. Humans
   have been colonizing the 500 light-years around Earth for a few
   thousand years, and have never run into a sentient alien species --
   until now. The discovery of an Industrial Age alien race upsets the
   established protocols of the ship, leading to uncertainty and delays in
   habitation, which in turn leads to societal unrest and conflict aboard
   the ship.
