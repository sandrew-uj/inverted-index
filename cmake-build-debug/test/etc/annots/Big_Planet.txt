   Big Planet had been colonized hundreds of years prior to the start of
   the novel by misfits, faddists, cultists and anti-government advocates
   from Earth. The environment is Earth-like, including the surface
   gravity: even though the planet is much larger than Earth (hence the
   name), it is much less dense, resulting from a scarcity of metal. As a
   result, a large number of technologically backward societies have
   developed, many of them ruled by petty tyrants and prey to lawlessness,
   murder and mayhem.

   Commissions from Earth have visited Big Planet at irregular intervals
   for 500 years to little effect: the majority of them are never heard
   from again. The latest, headed by Claude Glystra, arrives to try to
   stop the illegal importation of arms from Earth and halt Big Planet's
   slave trade, especially targeting Charley Lysidder, the ruthless,
   expansion-minded Bajarnum of Beaujolais. However their starship is
   sabotaged by Lysidder's agents and crashes near a quaint village called
   Jubilith, near Beaujolais.

   The survivors attempt to reach Earth Enclave, 40,000 miles away, armed
   with little more than their wits and a few modern hand weapons. A
   Jubilith resident, Natilien-Thilssa, whom they call "Nancy", insists on
   tagging along, despite Glystra's opposition. The team begins to dwindle
   as Lysidder's efforts and the dangers of Big Planet take their toll.
   Nevertheless, by sheer tenacity, resourcefulness and some luck, Glystra
   manages to triumph over Lysidder, despite the presence of Lysidder's
   agents within his own small group.

   Among the many societies, benign or bizarre, that Glystra and his
   companions encounter along the wind-driven monoline (their version of
   the yellow brick road), is the quasi-utopian society of Kirstendale. At
   first, it appears to be based on snobbish principles, but an odd twist
   reveals it to be surprisingly egalitarian.
