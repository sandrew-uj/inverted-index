   The book is both an adventure story and a satire on the scientific
   dispute over Creationism. It is set on Kforri, an earthlike planet of
   the star Muphrid (Eta Booetis). There descendants of space travelers
   from Earth have reverted to a pre-technological society. The truth of
   their origin has faded into legend, and as a result the story of the
   space voyage and the scientific theory of evolution have become
   competing accounts of the genesis of humanity. In an ironic reversal,
   the orthodox view, as established by the Holy Syncretic Church, holds
   that man evolved from the native animals of Kforri. Skeptics against
   the received dogma, known as Descensionists or Anti-Evolutionists, are
   more open to the spaceflight theory, which the Church views as heresy.
   De Camp portrays the beliefs of the Church as a ludicrous mishmash of
   half-remembered Earth faiths and history: its deities, for instance,
   include "the holy trinity of Yez, Moham, and Bud," "Yustinn, god of
   law," "Napoin, god of war," "Kliopat, goddess of love," "Niuto, god of
   wisdom," and "Froit, maker of souls."

   Marko Prokopiu, a schoolteacher in Skudra the conservative country of
   Vizantia, has been converted to Anti-Evolutionism by his houseguest,
   travel writer Chet Mongamri of Anglonia, and as the story opens is
   found guilty in court having taught the heresy to his students. While
   he is incarcerated, his wife Petronela runs off with Mongamri, so his
   mother engineers his escape from prison and instructs him to pursue and
   kill them to redeem his honor. Marko tracks his victims to the
   university town of Thine, but is knocked unconscious in a riot before
   he can murder them. His old professor hides him from the authorities
   and introduces him to the Anglonian philosopher Boert Halran, who is in
   Vizantia to acquire sealant for his experimental hot air balloon. Marko
   and Halran end up traveling together to Anglonia across the desert
   country of Arabistan, the former still on the trail of the fugitives,
   and the latter to work on his balloon. On the way Halran persuades
   Marko his vendetta is immoral and convinces him to abandon it, while
   Marko saves the philosopher's life when their caravan is attacked by
   bandits.

   Marko finds Anglonia a perplexing country. Niok, the chief city, seems
   populated mostly by genial criminals. The country as a whole is
   permissive in comparison to Vizantia, with divorce easy and common and
   children outrageously spoiled. Mongamri and Petronela have found the
   perfect refuge, for in Anglonia their transgression is no crime, while
   any attempt at vengeance would be. Regardless, and despite his pledge
   to Halran, Marko remains determined to confront the fugitives, for an
   explanation if nothing else. Locating Mongamri's home in the Anglonian
   city of Lann, he pays them a call, but is attacked by Mongamri, who
   assumes he still intends to murder them. Marko is forced to kill
   Mongamri in self-defense as Petronela flees. Realizing he has just made
   Lann too hot for himself, Marko seeks sanctuary with Halran, who takes
   him on as his assistant in completing his balloon. The plan is to
   spirit Marko out of Lann on its first flight and then fly onward to
   Vien in Eropia, where Halran intends to present the balloon at a
   philosophical convention.

   A storm blows the balloon off course, over the Medranian Sea, and the
   pair is forced to land on the island of Afka to resupply. The Afkans
   are hostile to all outsiders, but are persuaded to spare their lives
   and release them in return for being taught how to build a super weapon
   (a ballista) to help defend their island. Marko and Halran resume their
   flight, only to be again forced down on Mnaenn, the island of women,
   where an all-female society of witches adhering to the cult of Einstein
   jealously guards the Great Fetish, said to hold the truth regarding
   human origins. Sentenced to death for trespassing, the two are set free
   by Sinthi, a disaffected witch attracted to Marko. During their escape
   they stumble across the Great Fetish, which turns out to be a large set
   of boxes containing oddly mottled metallic cards. Marko takes some of
   them, after which the two seize the ruling Stringiarch as a hostage
   until their balloon is refueled and reinflated, and take off again.

   This time they reach their destination, the country of Eropia, where on
   landing they are conducted to Vien for the philosophical convention.
   There, however, they themselves in yet another predicament; Alzander
   Mirando, dictator of Eropia, has decided to settle the
   Evolutionist/Descensionist controversy once and for all by having the
   issue debated before him by the gathered philosophers and Eropia's
   churchmen; all members of the losing side will be executed.

   While awaiting this gloomy prospect, the philosophers continue their
   convention. In addition to Halran's balloon, the latest wonders are the
   discoveries in optics by Dama and Ryoske Chimei, two brothers from
   Mingkwo who have invented a telescope and microscope. One of Marko's
   cards is examined under the microscope and discovered to contain
   printing in Old Anglonian (English) too small to be seen by the naked
   eye; the cards are in fact microcards containing a library of knowledge
   from Earth. An expert in Old Anglonian begins translating them, and
   finds that there is truth to both theories of human origins; humanity
   did evolve from lower animals, but on Earth, not Kforri, and did indeed
   arrive on Kforri by spacecraft. This is not likely to be the solution
   Mirando wants, but Marko, inspired by the escape from Mnaenn, has a
   plan.

   When Mirando arrives for the debate, he is offered an ascent in
   Halran's balloon. Accepting, he quickly discovers himself Marko's
   captive, his safety dependent on all the philosophers being escorted to
   the coast and given charge of a steamship (another recent invention).
   The scheme goes without a hitch, and all the members of the convention
   proceed by sea to Mnaenn, which they seize from the witches. More about
   the lost history of Kforri is discovered from the witches and the
   archive of the Great Fetish. They learn the planet gained its name from
   that given by the discovering expedition (K40 becoming Kforri), and
   that the expedition members disagreed and dispersed, eventually forming
   nations with cultures and languages derived from their native ones. For
   instance, the name of Marko's homeland of Vizantia is derived from
   Byzantium and the Island of Mnaenn from Manhattan. The names of other
   countries and locales are also corruptions of earthly originals,
   including Eropia (Europe), Afka (Africa), Lann (London), Niok (New
   York), and Vien (Vienna).

   The philosophers intend to found on Mnaenn a philosophical republic and
   translate and disseminate the data from the card archive of the Great
   Fetish for the benefit of all humanity, eventually hoping to build
   spaceships to travel back to Earth. Marko, however, is more interested
   in pursuing his interest in Sinthi, Petronela having divorced him after
   the accidental slaying of her lover Mongamri.
