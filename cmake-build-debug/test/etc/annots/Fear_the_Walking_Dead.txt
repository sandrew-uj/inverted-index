   Set in Los Angeles, California and later in Mexico, the first three
   seasons of Fear the Walking Dead follow a dysfunctional, blended family
   composed of high school counselor Madison Clark, her English teacher
   fiance Travis Manawa, her daughter Alicia, her drug addict son Nick,
   Travis' son from a previous marriage, Chris, Chris' mother Liza Ortiz,
   and others who join their group at the onset of the zombie
   apocalypse. They must reinvent themselves, learning new skills
   and adopting new attitudes in order to survive as civilization
   collapses around them.

   Beginning in the fourth season, the series shifts focus towards Morgan
   Jones, a character from the original series, who encounters the group's
   surviving members and new survivors in Texas.
