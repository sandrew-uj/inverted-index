   The two-hour production hypothesizes the effects on modern-day earth of
   a large comet impacting in Mexico near the same location of the
   Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, the ancient impact of a comet or
   meteor that is believed to have triggered the mass extinction of the
   dinosaurs.

   The film alternates between interviews with climatologists and
   researchers and dramatized scenes following several groups of people as
   they attempt to survive in the days and months after the disaster: a
   separated family in France, a pair of scientists in Hawaii, a man who
   manages to survive for a period of time near the ground zero impact in
   Mexico, and a tribe in Cameroon.
