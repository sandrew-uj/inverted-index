   Half-Life 2 takes place approximately twenty years after the incident
   at the Black Mesa Research Facility from the first game, in which
   scientists accidentally opened a portal to the hostile dimension Xen.
   The game begins with Gordon Freeman being awoken from stasis by the
   mysterious G-Man, who reveals that the Black Mesa incident
   attracted the attention of a multidimensional empire called the
   Combine, which conquered Earth in seven hours. The Combine have
   implemented a brutal police state by biologically assimilating humans
   and other species. The G-Man inserts Gordon into a train arriving at
   City 17, the site of the Combine Citadel, where Dr. Wallace Breen, the
   former Black Mesa administrator who negotiated Earth's surrender,
   governs as the Combine's puppet ruler.

   After eluding the Combine forces, Gordon joins a resistance led by
   former Black Mesa scientist Dr. Eli Vance, which also includes Vance's
   daughter Alyx, former Black Mesa security guard Barney Calhoun, who
   works undercover as a Civil Protection officer, and another Black Mesa
   scientist, Dr. Kleiner. After a failed attempt to teleport to the
   resistance base, Black Mesa East, from Kleiner's makeshift laboratory,
   Gordon progresses on foot through the city's canal system. He obtains
   an airboat and battles through sewers and rivers.

   At Black Mesa East, Gordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets another
   resistance scientist, Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her
   pet robot, Dog, and gives him the gravity gun, an instrument that can
   manipulate large objects. When the base is attacked by Combine forces,
   Eli and Mossman are captured and taken to the Combine detention
   facility Nova Prospekt. Separated from Alyx, Gordon detours through the
   zombie-infested town of Ravenholm, aided by its last survivor, Father
   Grigori. Escaping the town, Gordon discovers a resistance outpost. He
   uses a customized dune buggy to travel a crumbling coastal road to Nova
   Prospekt, fighting off alien antlions, and helping the resistance fend
   off Combine raids.

   Gordon breaks into Nova Prospekt and reunites with Alyx. They locate
   Eli, but discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can
   stop her, Mossman teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel.
   The Combine teleporter explodes moments after Gordon and Alyx use it to
   escape Nova Prospekt.

   Returning to Kleiner's lab, Gordon and Alyx learn that the teleporter
   malfunctioned and that a week has passed. In their absence, the
   resistance has mobilized against the Combine. With the aid of Dog and
   Barney, Gordon fights his way inside the Citadel. A security system
   inadvertently supercharges Gordon's gravity gun, allowing him to fight
   his way up the Citadel.

   Gordon is captured in a Combine transport pod and taken to Breen's
   office, where he and Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in
   captivity. Breen explains his plans to further conquer humanity with
   the Combine, contrary to what he told Mossman. Angry, Mossman frees
   Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen can teleport them off-world. Breen
   tries to escape through a teleporter, but Gordon destroys its reactor
   with energy orbs launched from a gravity gun, killing Breen. Just as
   the reactor explodes, the G-Man reappears and freezes time. He praises
   Gordon's work and mentions offers for Gordon's "services", before
   placing him back into stasis.
