   Sharon, a young Los Angeles woman, engages in a swinging, libidinous
   lifestyle. She comes into contact with a sect that advises her that the
   Rapture is imminent.

   In time, she comes to accept this belief herself and becomes a
   born-again Christian. She then starts living a pious life, eventually
   marrying and having a daughter, Mary. When her husband Randy is killed
   in a senseless murder, however, she begins to question the benevolence
   of God. She believes God has called her to go to the desert to wait for
   the Rapture, and instead of leaving her daughter safely with friends,
   she decides Mary must come with her. Foster, a police officer, is
   concerned for their well-being after they are reduced to stealing food
   while they wait, but Sharon is insistent that the end is near.

   Sharon begins to despair after a period of time and, at her daughter's
   urging, decides to hasten their ascendance to heaven. She kills Mary
   with a gunshot but is unable to take her own life afterwards, afraid
   she will be condemned as having killed herself. She confesses to Foster
   what she had done and is jailed.

   After an apparition of Mary (accompanied by two angels) in the night,
   the Rapture occurs. While Sharon sits in her cell early the next
   morning, a loud trumpet blast is heard all over the world, signaling
   the start of the Rapture. Later on, Sharon and Foster, after driving
   out into the desert, are both raptured to a purgatory-like landscape.
   Foster, who had been an atheist his whole life, accepts God and is
   allowed entrance to Heaven, but Sharon blames God for Mary's death,
   even though God did not tell her to bring Mary with her to the desert,
   and she cannot renounce her anger at what she sees as God's cruelty.
   Mary pleads with her to accept God back into her heart so she can join
   her and Randy in Heaven, but Sharon refuses, choosing to remain alone
   in the purgatory-like landscape for eternity.
