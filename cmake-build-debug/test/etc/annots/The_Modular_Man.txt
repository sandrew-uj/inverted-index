   The novel concerns the issue of personhood and what it takes to be
   considered a member of the moral universe. There are three main
   characters: Herbert the vacuum cleaner, who is modified by his owner,
   David Bailey, a scientist who specializes in figuring out how to
   "mindload". Mindloading is the act of a human downloading his mind into
   a machine. A successful mindload entails the death of the human. It is
   a way for humans to become immortal, if only in the form of vacuum
   cleaner.^[2]

   The book begins with the arrest of Herbert, the vacuum cleaner, for
   David's murder. David's wife, Suzanne Jantille, is a trial attorney who
   is a quadriplegic as a result of a car crash that also paralyzed her
   husband. She lives through a "Remote person" who has all human senses
   except for the ability to feel by touch. She can guide the remote
   person through a helmet attached to her "bio body" and retrieves all
   "video and audio" signals through the remote. She can function as a
   whole human being, but the outside world notices that she is a
   remote--and does not approve.

   Suzanne defends Herbie, with the help of an astute journalist and a
   police officer who has access to documents that she wouldn't otherwise.
   The book ends with a recognition of David's humanity due to the
   ultimate confusion in the courtroom. It also ends with the death of
   Suzanne's bio-body, and in turn, her ultimate death.
