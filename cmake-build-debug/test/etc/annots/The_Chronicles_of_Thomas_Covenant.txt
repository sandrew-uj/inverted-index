   The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is a series of ten high fantasy
   novels written by American author Stephen R. Donaldson. The series
   began as a trilogy, entitled The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the
   Unbeliever. This was followed by another trilogy, The Second Chronicles
   of Thomas Covenant, and finally a tetralogy, The Last Chronicles of
   Thomas Covenant.

   The main character of the stories is Thomas Covenant, an embittered and
   cynical writer, afflicted with leprosy and shunned by society, and
   fated to become the heroic savior of the Land, an alternate world. In
   ten novels, published between 1977 and 2013, he struggles against Lord
   Foul, "the Despiser", who intends to escape the bondage of the physical
   universe and wreak revenge upon his arch-enemy, "the Creator".
