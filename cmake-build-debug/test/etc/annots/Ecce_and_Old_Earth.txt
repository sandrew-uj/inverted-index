   Glawen Clattuc has learned that his father, Scharde, is being held
   prisoner by an old enemy, Smonny Clattuc. Scharde and others who have
   earned Smonny's wrath are trapped on the unsettled continent of Ecce,
   which is teeming with very dangerous animals. Glawen rescues Scharde,
   Eustace Chilke and another prisoner who proves to be a treasure trove
   of very important information. Bureau B, the security arm of the
   Conservancy government, then liberates the rest of the inmates.

   Meanwhile, Wayness Tamm (Glawen's romantic interest) is busy trying to
   track down the all-important missing Charter, which confers ownership
   of the planet Cadwal. The trail leads from Earth to various other
   planets. She is not alone on this quest however; two factions working
   to overthrow the Conservancy also seek the document and will go to any
   lengths to secure it. Glawen eventually discovers that her letters to
   him have been intercepted, and sets out after her.
