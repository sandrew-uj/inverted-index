   In 1839, during Poe's lifetime, a collection of his strange tales was
   published, but it did not include some highly regarded tales which were
   written later, including "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" and "A Descent
   into the Maelstroem". The first posthumous collection of Poe's works
   was compiled in 1850 and included a memoir from Rufus Wilmot Griswold,
   but this did not confine itself to his tales of suspense and related
   tales. Several collections of Poe's prose and poetry followed. The
   precursor to Tales of Mystery and Imagination was a collection of Poe's
   works entitled Tales of Mystery, Imagination and Humor. The title
   "Tales of Mystery and Imagination" was first used by "The World's
   Classics", London, and printed by Grant Richard, 48 Leicester Sq. in
   1902. The title of this collection was then adopted by Padraic Colum in
   1908 in view of the growing reputation of Poe's taste for suspense,
   especially in the context of what his French critic M. Brunetiere
   called events "on the margin" of life. The original collection, in
   keeping with its title, deliberately excluded Poe's poems, comedies and
   essays. In his introduction to the 1908 edition Colum cites a reason
   for his adoption of this selection: his opinion that "tales" as opposed
   to "short stories" were so short that they tended to lack descriptions
   of socially important experiences. Colum hence also left out two works
   as too lengthy, these being The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of
   Nantucket and "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall".

   Colum's 1908 collection of Poe's tales was published as a book
   specifically aimed at the general reading public by the influential
   publishing house of Geoffrey Newnes Ltd. using its Home Library Book
   Company, as part of "John O'London's" Home Library.
