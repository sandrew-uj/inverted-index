   While visiting with her sister a version of Earth on which life never
   began, Marva Rogan has gone missing. Her sister Marfy is certain that
   she is still alive, but is equally certain that she is no longer on
   that timetrack. Blake Walker, on his first solo mission as an Apt
   Wardsman, picks up Marfy to take her back to Vroom, succeeding in spite
   of someone having sabotaged his crosstime shuttle.

   Based on clues found in Marva's personal possessions, Com Varlt decides
   to take a search team into a world in which the Nation of New Britain
   and the Toltec Empire glare at each other across the Mississippi River.
   Varlt, Walker, Marfy, Pague Lo Sige, and several other agents disguise
   themselves as a team of licensed traders and make their way to the
   trade town of Xomatl.

   Marfy locates Marva on the estate of a minor lord and she, Walker, and
   Lo Sige extract Marva from that estate, carrying her, wrapped in vines
   covered with fragrant flowers, off the estate during a ceremony in
   which guests are expected to ravish and plunder the estate's formal
   garden. The person driving the getaway van then takes the four of them
   to an isolated house, where they are rendered unconscious. When they
   wake up they discover that they have been taken to the lifeless Earth
   and abandoned to starve to death.

   Using components salvaged from the ruined communications system, Lo
   Sige builds a device that will amplify the telepathic signals that he
   and the Rogan twins transmit and, he hopes, will send them to alternate
   timetracks. The device succeeds in attracting a rescuer, who takes the
   four strandees to a world where other wardsmen have come with their
   shuttles to avoid being captured by forces loyal to Saur To'Kekrops,
   the would-be dictator of Vroom.

   With time running out, Walker goes to Vroom alone, allegedly to join
   To'Kekrops. He offers to lead a capture team to pick up Erc Rogan,
   To'Kekrops' most dangerous nemesis. Once back on the refuge world,
   Walker betrays To'Kekrops' men and leads his own team back to Vroom to
   confront To'Kekrops, the spider at the center of the web of treason.
   With a more powerful teledynamic amplifier, Lo Sige, Erc Rogan, his
   daughters, and another wardsman confront To'Kekrops and neutralize him.
   All that is left to do is to pick up the pieces and put the crosstime
   trading system back together again.
