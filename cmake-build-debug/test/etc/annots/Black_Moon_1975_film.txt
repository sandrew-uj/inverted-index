   Lily (Cathryn Harrison) is attempting to seek refuge amidst an apparent
   gender-based civil war in which men and women are systematically
   killing one another. On a rural road, she encounters men executing
   women by firing squad, and flees with her car into the woods, following
   an overgrown road. There, she encounters a flock of sheep gathered
   around their shepherd, who has hanged himself from a tree. She later
   comes across a group of women donning military gear and torturing a
   young man. She abandons her car, fleeing on foot, and falls asleep in a
   meadow, where she hears the flowers beneath her crying in pain. Moments
   later, she witnesses a brown unicorn pass by, followed by a man on a
   horse, and a number of naked children who begin herding the sheep.

   Lily trails the man to an apparently abandoned chateau located beyond
   overgrowth on a hill. While exploring the house, she finds it fully
   furnished, but inhabited by numerous animals. Upstairs, she finds an
   elderly bedridden woman (Therese Giehse) chastising her pet rat,
   Humphrey. The woman proceeds to attack Lily before contacting an
   unknown person on a transistor radio, making cruel observations of
   Lily's appearance and revealing details of how Lily arrived there that
   she should have no way of knowing. A number of alarm clocks
   inexplicably go off, and the old woman tries to strangle Lily. When
   Lily slaps her, the woman dies.

   Outside, Lily's attention is diverted by a man (Joe Dallesandro)
   singing in the garden. Via telepathy, he communicates to her that his
   name is also Lily. His sister, also named Lily (Alexandra Stewart),
   whom Lily had mistaken for a man earlier, arrives on horseback. Lily
   attempts to explain to Brother and Sister Lily that their mother is
   dead, but they are impervious and refuse to speak to her. When she
   follows them upstairs, she witnesses the old woman return to life
   before Sister Lily breastfeeds her.

   Brother and Sister lock Lily in the room with the old woman, sending
   Lily into a rage. While exploring the room, she eats a piece of cheese
   and looks through a photo album containing pictures of the old woman,
   whilst the old woman continues to make observations about her to the
   unknown person on the radio. To the old woman's anger, Lily looks out
   the window and again sees the black unicorn. Lily climbs out the window
   and down the wall, and chases the unicorn around the sprawling property
   as it continuously eludes her. She is horrified when she stumbles upon
   the corpse of a soldier. Brother picks the corpse up and buries it in a
   grave. The unicorn appears again, and Lily chases it until she is
   attacked by the band of nude children. The unicorn once again appears
   to Lily, and tells her she is mean. The unicorn also tells Lily the old
   woman upstairs is not real.

   In the house, Lily observes Sister serving the children dinner.
   Upstairs, Lily tries to comfort the old woman after another fight with
   Humphrey, and agrees to breastfeed her. Later, Lily plays Tristan und
   Isolde on the parlor piano. The children sing along, while Sister
   paints Brother's face and the two reenact the opera. At dawn, Lily
   finds the old woman has disappeared. A hawk flies into the house, which
   Brother decapitates with a sword. Brother and Sister then battle one
   another in the garden as Lily watches from the window. Brother beats
   Sister with a stick, and Sister bashes him in the face with a rock as
   sounds of gunfire emanate from the woods. Lily climbs into the old
   woman's empty bed and tries unsuccessfully to use the radio, after
   which a snake slithers onto the bed. Outside, a large crowd of sheep
   and turkeys surround the house. After falling asleep, Lily awakens to
   find the unicorn seated in front of the fireplace. Lily prepares to
   breastfeed the unicorn.
