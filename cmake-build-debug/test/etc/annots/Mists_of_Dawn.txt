   Dr. Robert Nye, a nuclear physicist working at White Sands Missile
   Range has finally finished his space-time travel machine after 20 years
   of research. On the eve of its maiden voyage to Ancient Rome, Dr. Nye's
   nephew Mark is trapped inside and sent back in time to the year 50,000
   BC when a nearby rocket test explosion sends him careening into the
   controls. When Mark arrives at his destination he must survive the two
   weeks it takes the space-time machine to recharge for the return trip
   with nothing but a few matches, a pocket knife, and a 6-shot .45
   revolver.^[1]
