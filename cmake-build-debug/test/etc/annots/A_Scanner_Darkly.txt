   The protagonist is Bob Arctor, member of a household of drug users, who
   is also living a double life as an undercover police agent assigned to
   spy on Arctor's household. Arctor shields his identity from those in
   the drug subculture and from the police. (The requirement that
   narcotics agents remain anonymous, to avoid collusion and other forms
   of corruption, becomes a critical plot point late in the book.) While
   posing as a drug user, Arctor becomes addicted to "Substance D" (also
   referred to as "Slow Death", "Death" or "D"), a powerful psychoactive
   drug. A conflict is Arctor's love for Donna, a drug dealer, through
   whom he intends to identify high-level dealers of Substance D.

   When performing his work as an undercover agent, Arctor goes by the
   name "Fred" and wears a "scramble suit" that conceals his identity from
   other officers. Then he is able to sit in a police facility and observe
   his housemates through "holo-scanners", audio-visual surveillance
   devices that are placed throughout the house. Arctor's use of the drug
   causes the two hemispheres of his brain to function independently or
   "compete". When Arctor sees himself in the videos saved by the
   scanners, he does not realize that it is him. Through a series of drug
   and psychological tests, Arctor's superiors at work discover that his
   addiction has made him incapable of performing his job as a narcotics
   agent. They do not know his identity because he wears the scramble
   suit, but when his police supervisor suggests to him that he might be
   Bob Arctor, he is confused and thinks it cannot be possible.

   Donna takes Arctor to "New-Path", a rehabilitation clinic, just as
   Arctor begins to experience the symptoms of Substance D withdrawal. It
   is revealed that Donna has been a narcotics agent all along, working as
   part of a police operation to infiltrate New-Path and determine its
   funding source. Without his knowledge, Arctor has been selected to
   penetrate the organization. As part of the rehab program, Arctor is
   renamed "Bruce" and forced to participate in cruel group-dynamic games,
   intended to break the will of the patients.

   The story ends with Bruce working at a New-Path farming commune, where
   he is suffering from a serious neurocognitive deficit, after
   withdrawing from Substance D. Although considered by his handlers to be
   nothing more than a walking shell of a man, "Bruce" manages to spot
   rows of blue flowers growing hidden among rows of corn and realizes
   that the blue flowers are Mors ontologica, the source of Substance D.
   The book ends with Bruce hiding a flower in his shoe to give to his
   "friends"--undercover police agents posing as recovering addicts at the
   Los Angeles New-Path facility--on Thanksgiving.
