   Anderson Lake is an economic hitman for the AgriGen Corporation,
   working in Thailand. He owns a factory trying to mass-produce a
   revolutionary new model of kink-spring (the successor, in the absence
   of oil or petroleum, to the internal combustion engine) that will store
   gigajoules of energy. But the factory is a cover for his real mission:
   discovering the location of the Thai seedbank, with which Thailand has
   so far managed to resist the calorie companies' attempts at
   agro-economic subjugation. He has heavily delegated the running of the
   factory to his Chinese manager, Hock Seng, a refugee from the Malaysian
   purge of the ethnic Chinese. Hock Seng was a successful businessman in
   his former life and he plots to steal the kink-spring designs kept in
   Anderson's safe.

   When Emiko, an illegal Japanese "windup" (genetically modified human)
   girl stuck in bonded servitude in a sex club, reveals Anderson
   information she has learned about the secret seedbank, he in return
   tells her about a refuge in the north of Thailand where people of
   Emiko's kind (the "New People") live together. From then on, she
   becomes determined to escape to this place by paying off Raleigh, the
   club's owner.

   Meanwhile, Jaidee Rojjanasukchai, a zealous and honest captain of the
   White shirts (the armed, enforcement wing of the Environment Ministry,
   which is charged with preventing illegal imports, unauthorized energy
   use, and the incursions of bio-engineered viruses), intercepts and
   destroys a dirigible containing a great amount of illegal contraband.
   Anderson and others in the foreign trading community (known as
   "farangs") pressure Akkarat to make Jaidee back off.

   To make him fall in line, they kidnap Jaidee's wife. When he learns of
   this, he submits and is sentenced to nine years in a monastery. Later,
   realizing that his wife will never be returned to him and has likely
   been murdered, he escapes and is caught and killed while trying to
   assassinate Akkarat. The other White shirts declare him a martyr and
   rise up against the Trade Ministry.

   At the same time, Hock Seng learns that factory workers are falling
   victim to a new plague originating from the kink-spring factory. He has
   the bodies disposed of surreptitiously. As the White shirts take
   control of Bangkok, he escapes from the factory into hiding. Anderson
   discovers Hock Seng's flight and also goes into hiding

   Jaidee's replacement (and former protege), Kanya, discovers the new
   plague and sets about trying to contain it while dealing with guilt of
   being Akkarat's mole and betraying Jaidee. She reluctantly seeks help
   from Gibbons, the scientist at the heart of the Thai seedbank, who is
   revealed to be a renegade AgriGen scientist. He identifies the new
   plague and gives clues to Kanya that lead her to Anderson's factory.

   Anderson meets with Akkarat and the Somdet Chaopraya, who is the regent
   to the young Thai Queen and the most powerful person in all of
   Thailand. Anderson offers to supply a new strain of GM rice and a
   private army from AgriGen to repel the White shirts in exchange for
   access to the seedbank and lowering of the trade barriers. To seal the
   deal, knowing of the Somdet Chaopraya's addiction to sexual novelty, he
   takes him to Emiko's club. When the Somdet Chaopraya and his entourage
   later sexually humiliate and degrade her, Emiko snaps and kills them.
   She escapes and seeks refuge with Anderson. Akkarat accuses General
   Pracha of orchestrating the Somdet Chaopraya's assassination and uses
   this as a pretext for to fight Pracha and the White shirts. The capital
   is plunged into civil war.

   Having failed to steal the kink-spring designs, Hock Seng tries to
   capture Emiko for ransom. However, Anderson makes a deal with him: Hock
   Seng would be patronized by AgriGen and Emiko would remain with
   Anderson.

   In short order, Pracha and most of the top Environment Ministry men are
   killed. Akkarat, now all-powerful, appoints his spy Kanya as the new
   chief of the Environment Ministry. He also opens up Thailand to the
   calorie companies, and grants Anderson and AgriGen access to the
   seedbank.

   Kanya, accompanies the "calorie men" to the seedbank, where she reneges
   and executes the AgriGen team. She then directs the seedbank's monks to
   move the seeds to a pre-arranged secure location. With the hidden
   military arsenal in the seedbank, she orchestrates the destruction of
   the levees around Bangkok, flooding it.

   Bangkok's people and the capital relocate to the site of Ayutthaya.
   Akkarat is stripped of his powers and sentenced to servitude as a monk.
   Anderson dies of the plague originating from his factory while he is in
   hiding with Emiko. Emiko is found by Gibbons, who promises that he will
   use Emiko's DNA to engineer a new race of fertile New People, thus
   fulfilling her dream of living with her own kind.
