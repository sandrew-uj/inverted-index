   Carol, a self-reliant teen-aged American girl, is sent to England to
   stay a month with relatives currently living in a big old rented house
   on Parchment Street, next to a graveyard in a small village. Her first
   encounter with the locals involves a group of delinquent bullies, whom
   she drives away, only to learn they're the cronies of her cousin Bruce.
   Naturally, she and Bruce don't immediately hit it off well with each
   other.

   After various misadventures she witnesses a signal event in the
   cellar--the ghost of a swordsman dressed in black, who disappears into
   a wall. After she learns Bruce has also seen the ghost, the two enter a
   tentative alliance to investigate the mystery. The first ghost and
   another, this one of a young girl, are trapped in a daily reenactment
   of traumatic events that originally took place during the English Civil
   War, over three hundred years before. Only the children seem able to
   perceive the ghosts; neither Carol's hidebound Uncle Harold nor the
   more open-minded Father Malory can see them.

   Eventually Carol and Bruce uncover a walled-up tunnel leading from the
   cellar of the house to the nearby church, following the ghosts to the
   bloody conclusion of their reenactments, and are able to lay them to
   rest by burying their bones, which they discover in the tunnel. In the
   course of their adventure they develop a more sympathetic relationship.
