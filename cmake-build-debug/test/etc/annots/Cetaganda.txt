   Previous novels referred to the Cetagandan Empire because of its
   occupation of Barrayar decades before the events of the first novel,
   Shards of Honor. Cetagandan soldiers of the ghem military class appear
   in The Warrior's Apprentice, Ethan of Athos and Brothers in Arms, which
   describe their use of facial paint. This novel introduces the haut
   ruling class of the Empire, who are not at all militaristic, but seem
   to have a way of controlling their military classes to keep the Empire
   stable.

   Miles and Ivan are sent to the home world of the Cetagandan Empire to
   represent Barrayar at the state funeral of the dowager Empress Lisbet,
   mother of the current Emperor, the haut Fletchir Giaja. They quickly
   become entangled in an internal Cetagandan plot when they arrive at a
   nearly deserted docking bay, much to their puzzlement. A ba (a sexless
   servant of the Cetagandan rulers) unexpectedly rushes into their
   spaceship. A struggle ensues, in which the ba drops a weapon and some
   sort of artifact before fleeing. Miles takes it upon himself to
   investigate -- without informing his superiors -- and eventually
   discovers that the artifact is a fake copy of the priceless Great Key,
   which has been stolen. The ba is later found dead.

   Realizing that an unknown enemy is trying to frame him and Barrayar,
   Miles forms an unusual alliance with the haut Rian Degtiar, the
   "Handmaiden of the Star Creche", who is charged with the duties of
   Empress until the new one is chosen. The Star Creche is the heart of
   the genetic engineering project that is, or appears to be, elevating
   the haut class beyond being merely human.

   Miles solves the complex mystery and stops a plot to fragment the
   Cetagandan Empire into eight dangerously expansionist-minded parts, a
   plot which itself is hijacked by one of the haut governors for personal
   gain, abetted by a renegade haut lady and his top ghem General. Then,
   much to his chagrin, he is publicly awarded the Order of Merit, one of
   the very highest Cetagandan honors, by the Emperor himself. He also
   picks up clues to a Cetagandan genetic experiment, which becomes the
   object of much skulduggery in Ethan of Athos.
