   As a frame story, Wells claims that the book is his edited version of
   notes written by an eminent diplomat, Dr Philip Raven, who had been
   having dream visions of a history textbook published in 2106 and wrote
   down what he could remember of it. It is split into five separate
   sections or "books":
    1. Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns - The history of
       the world, starting with the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 and
       up to 1933.
    2. The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration - 1933-1960.
    3. The World Renaissance: The Birth of the Modern State - 1960-1978.
    4. The Modern State Militant - 1978-2059.
    5. The Modern State in Control of Life - 2059 to New Year's Day 2106.

   The book was written as a future history. In late 1933 or early 1934,
   US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's failure to implement the New Deal
   and revive the US economy, and Adolf Hitler's failure to revive the
   German economy by rearmament causes the worldwide economic crisis to
   continue for thirty years, concurrently with the war, as described
   above.

   Wells predicted a Second World War breaking out with a European
   conflagration from the flashpoint of a violent clash between Germans
   and Poles at Danzig. Wells set its date as January 1940, quite close to
   the actual date of September 1939. Wells's imagined war sharply
   diverges from the actual war when Poland proves a military match for
   Germany, in an inconclusive war that lasts ten years. More countries
   are eventually dragged into the fighting, but France and the Soviet
   Union are only marginally involved, the United Kingdom remains neutral
   and the United States fights inconclusively with Japan. The Austrian
   Anschluss happens during, rather than before, the war. Czechoslovakia
   avoids German occupation and its President Edvard Benes survives to
   initiate the final "Suspension of Hostilities" in 1950.

   Wells's prediction was widely off the mark with regard to Spain, which
   the book assumed would manage to stay away from the violent passions
   sweeping the rest of Europe. In real life, the Spanish Civil War would
   become the main focus of these passions, two years after the book was
   published. Evidently, Wells greatly overestimated the influence of
   Spanish Liberals such as Unamuno on Spanish society as a whole.

   Wells correctly predicted that the coming war would involve both sides
   launching heavy bombings of each other's main cities, and his detailed
   depiction of the destroyed Unter Den Linden closely predicted its
   actual fate in the war. However, Wells wrongly assumed that land
   fighting would quickly bog down, as in World War I, and that the idea
   of using tanks to develop a war of movement would come to naught. Wells
   predicted that submarines would become the launching pads for "air
   torpedoes" (missiles) carrying weapons of mass destruction, enabling a
   country to threaten the destruction of places halfway around the world
   although that actually happened decades after World War II.

   Wells's predicted war ends with no victor but total exhaustion,
   collapse and disintegration of all the fighting states and of the
   neutral countries, which are equally affected by the deepening economic
   crisis. The whole world descends into chaos: nearly all governments
   break down, and a devastating plague in 1956 and 1957 kills a large
   part of humanity and almost destroys civilization.

   Wells then envisages a benevolent dictatorship, "The Dictatorship of
   the Air", which arises from the controllers of the world's surviving
   transport systems, who are the only people with global power. The
   dictatorship promotes science, enforces Basic English as a global
   lingua franca and eradicates all religions, setting the world on the
   road to a peaceful utopia. When the dictatorship chooses to execute a
   subject, the condemned person is given a chance to take a poison tablet
   (modelled on the Hemlock given to Socrates).

   The achievement of a classless society is not via a Marxist
   Dictatorship of the Proletariat, an idea that Wells completely
   rejected. Rather, the working class is massively "pulled upwards" and
   completely eliminated in several generations of intensive upward social
   mobility, in effect leaving a humanity entirely composed of "middle
   class intellectuals". The limited amount of physical labor still needed
   is performed by the world's youths, who undergo two years of "labor
   conscription" instead of military conscription, which is no longer
   needed.

   Eventually, after about 100 years of reshaping humanity, the
   Dictatorship of the Air is overthrown in a completely-bloodless coup,
   the former rulers are sent into honourable retirement and the world
   state "withers away". The last part of the book is a detailed
   description of the utopian world that emerges. The ultimate aim of this
   utopian world is to produce a world society composed entirely of
   polymaths, every one of its members being the intellectual equal of the
   greatest geniuses of the past.

   The book displays one of the earliest uses of the abbreviation "C.E.",
   which Wells explains as "Christian Era" but it is now more usually
   understood as "Common Era".^[1]
