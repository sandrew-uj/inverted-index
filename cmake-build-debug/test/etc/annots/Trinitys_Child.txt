   The US president is informed by the head of SAC that a Soviet first
   strike is underway. The Soviet premier offers the United States three
   choices via a HOTLINE message:
    1. Accept the damage, and the exchange will end.
    2. Respond in kind, which will cause the deaths of 3 to 9 million
       people on both sides.
    3. Respond with a massive counterattack, and the Soviets will respond
       in kind.

   As the order to respond in kind is passed on, the first wave of Soviet
   ICBMs and SLBMs arrive and cripple most of America's missile silos and
   bomber bases. A Soviet missile detonates near Chevy Chase, Maryland,
   and the President is told that the Soviets have launched a second
   strike. The president reluctantly gives a second order to respond just
   before SAC and Omaha, Nebraska, are destroyed. As he is being evacuated
   from the White House, the president is told that the second Soviet
   launch was directed at the Chinese, which means a second strike by the
   United States is unnecessary. A nearby detonation causes Marine One to
   crash and seemingly kills the president.

   As missiles speed towards their targets and the alert goes out, the
   novel begins its sub-plot: tracking the actions of "Polar Bear One," a
   nuclear-armed B-52 bomber. The craft speeds towards the Soviet Union to
   await orders.

   Believing the president to be dead, a US Navy admiral codenamed
   "Harpoon" is given the assignment of locating a successor, who turns
   out to be the US Secretary of the Interior. He is sworn in and given
   the codename "Condor." Harpoon's Boeing E-4B becomes the American
   military's new command center. It is revealed that Baton Rouge,
   Seattle, Los Angeles, Colorado Springs, New Orleans, Phoenix, Raleigh,
   Honolulu and Washington, DC, have also been destroyed, and massive
   social disorder and rioting have broken out in the remaining cities
   across the country. It is briefly mentioned that Europe remained
   neutral during the conflict, but that India and Israel have declared
   war on Pakistan.

   Harpoon urges Condor to turn the bombers around to see if the Soviets
   respond in kind as a way of signaling an intent to de-escalate, since
   communications are down and direct talks have not been possible since
   the explosions. Colonel Fargo, a Soviet capabilities expert, suggests a
   decapitation strike targeting Soviet leadership bunkers with America's
   nuclear submarines. Believing that the US is "losing" the war, Condor
   orders the decapitation strike. Polar Bear One refuses the E-4B's
   orders and turns around. Seeing that as a sign for a truce, the Soviets
   turn 15 of their bombers around. Condor is urged by "Alice," who is now
   in charge of SAC aboard the Looking Glass Plane, to turn around another
   squadron of B-52s in response, but Condor refuses.

   It is then revealed that the president is still alive in a FEMA bunker
   outside Olney, Maryland. He learns that the Soviet premier is
   attempting to make contact through shortwave radio. Both negotiate a
   ceasefire. The president then contacts Alice, whom he orders to turn
   the bombers around. Alice, an Air Force general, cannot issue direct
   orders to the Navy, and the President's identity codes conflict with
   Condor's. The president contacts Condor to urge him to help secure a
   ceasefire, but Condor, believing he is a Soviet imposter, refuses.
   Alice tells the president that if both he and Condor give the
   submarines two different sets of orders, the submarines will go with
   the original orders (Condor's). The president and Alice attempt to
   create a plan to stop Condor. Alice suggests using the Looking Glass as
   a weapon to intercept the E-4B to kill Condor and to relinquish
   authority to the president.

   Alice attempts to catch up to Condor during a seven-hour window until
   the submarines surface to listen for new orders, which is when Condor
   will give the order for the decapitation strike. With minutes left, the
   flight crew of the E-4B, which is loyal to Alice, turns the plane into
   the path of the Looking Glass and kills everyone on board both planes.
   Command is returned to the president, who orders a full cessation of
   hostilities. The Soviet Union responds in kind. But Polar Bear One's
   fate, and the outcomes of the conflicts in the Middle East and between
   the Soviets and Chinese are left unanswered.
