   In 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second
   Impact, the child Shinji Ikari is summoned to Tokyo-3 by his estranged
   father Gendo, the commander of the paramilitary organization NERV.
   Shinji is caught in the crossfire between UN forces and an angel, an
   alien lifeform; Captain Misato Katsuragi rescues him and brings him to
   NERV headquarters. Gendo demands Shinji pilot Evangelion Unit 01, a
   giant bio-machine, against the angel. Shinji concedes when Gendo has
   Rei Ayanami, a wounded Evangelion pilot, prepared to be sent out
   instead. Shinji becomes unconscious during the fight due to the
   injuries inflicted by the Angel on Unit 01, because Evangelions
   sympathetically reflect the pain of the injuries they sustain onto
   their pilots. Unit 01 autonomously reactivates and wins the fight,
   after it goes berserk and destroys the Angel. Gendo informs his
   superiors at the enigmatic cabal SEELE that the "Human Instrumentality
   Project" is proceeding as planned.

   Misato becomes Shinji's guardian and he is enrolled in a local middle
   school. When another angel arrives, Shinji's classmates Toji Suzuhara
   and Kensuke Aida sneak out of their emergency shelter to watch the
   battle, but the angel throws Unit 01 onto a mountainside, nearly
   crushing them. Misato has the two take cover in Unit 01's cockpit and
   orders Shinji to retreat, but he ignores it and destroys the angel with
   Unit 01's knife. After Misato scolds him for insubordination, Shinji
   wanders off, and is recovered by NERV agents and brought back to her.

   The Sixth Angel appears, but when Shinji goes to attack it in Unit 01,
   the angel fires a powerful laser, critically injuring him, before
   beginning to drill into Tokyo-3 to reach NERV headquarters. He wakes up
   from a coma several hours later and Rei tells him she will take his
   place and leaves for the mission alone.

   To motivate the despondent Shinji, Misato takes him to the deepest
   level of NERV headquarters and shows him a giant white being crucified
   to a cross-like restraint: the Second Angel, Lilith. Misato explains
   the angels are attempting to initiate contact with Lilith and bring
   about the Third Impact, the prophesied end of all life on Earth.

   Shinji agrees to pilot Unit 01 against the angel alongside Rei in Unit
   00. He successfully destroys it with an experimental positron sniper
   rifle, which requires the entire electrical power output of Japan to
   power. Rei is nearly killed defending Shinji from the Angel's return
   fire, but he saves her by cooling Unit 00 in water and prying open its
   cockpit using Unit 01's knife. Rei, normally cold and emotionless,
   shares a smile with him.

   On the surface of the Moon, Kaworu Nagisa awakens from one of nine
   coffin-like containers arranged on the surface. In a pit in front of
   him, surrounded by construction equipment and scaffolding, is an
   unidentified giant, wearing a purple seven-eyed mask and wrapped in
   white bandages. A black monolith appears, through which he and SEELE 01
   engage in a cryptic conversation. Looking towards Earth, Kaworu says
   that "the third one" has not changed at all and that he looks forward
   to meeting Shinji.
