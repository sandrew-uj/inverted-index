   Quiller is introduced as a serving British intelligence officer in a
   black organization called "the Bureau" and as a veteran of clandestine
   service during World War II. Quiller never states which service he
   worked in during wartime, and we are not told the year in which that
   organization was founded. It is, however, mentioned the original
   explicit purpose of the Bureau was to prevent any possible resurgence
   of German militarism, any situation that might lead to something
   resembling a Fourth Reich.

   Numerous governments offered him medals for his actions in the war, but
   he refused them all. During and after his wartime service, Quiller
   became a specialist in understanding Nazi clandestine organizations and
   their activities, particularly the so-called "ratlines" used by Nazis
   to escape from justice. Most of the book takes place in 1965, by which
   time Quiller has been seconded by the Bureau to secretly provide large
   amounts of useful intelligence information to West Germany's main war
   crimes investigation agency, the Z Commission. Quiller is tired and
   wants to return home, but the Bureau persuades him to investigate the
   plans of a Nazi secret society. He agrees to do so in part because that
   secret society has just assassinated a friend and colleague whom he had
   deeply respected.
