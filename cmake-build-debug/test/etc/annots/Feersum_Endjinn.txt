   The narrative switches between four main characters. Count Sessine is a
   high-ranking member of the court who is assassinated, ending his last
   life. Reborn inside the crypt he comes under repeated attack and is
   almost permanently killed. On his last virtual life, he makes contact
   with a copy of himself who assists him. He spends many subjective years
   wandering the wider reaches of the crypt before being contacted by its
   representative who requests his aid in relation to the encroachment.

   Gadfium, the Chief Scientist of the ruling class, is engaged in a
   conspiracy with like-minded nobles who believe that the elite are not
   acting in the best interests of the population, and who question the
   real motive of the ongoing war with the rival clan of Engineers. She
   learns of a message apparently sent from the fast tower, the highest
   and previously inaccessible part of the castle, which stresses the
   danger of the Encroachment and tells of an attempt by the crypt to
   activate a long forgotten sub system which may prevent disaster. The
   message also warns that this will be opposed by those in power as it
   will threaten their interests. She and her fellow conspirators are
   considering how to respond when the security forces attempt to arrest
   them, although Gadfium manages to escape into the depths of the castle.

   Bascule the Teller is a young man who contacts the dead personalities
   within the crypt on behalf of their relatives or other interested
   parties. Whilst searching for a lost friend, he attracts the attention
   of the Security forces and takes refuge with various chimeric animals
   whose implants have taken on personalities from within the crypt. He is
   eventually tasked with ascending the central shaft of the highest tower
   in a vacuum balloon in order to reach its control room.

   Asura is a young woman who awakens in a re-incarnation facility with no
   memory. She is compelled to travel towards the castle, rapidly
   gathering knowledge about the world before being captured by the
   security forces. She is interrogated within the crypt, but is able to
   resist the questioning, becoming stronger at understanding and
   manipulating her virtual environments. As she escapes her virtual
   prison, she is physically freed by Gadfium, assisted by the copy of
   Count Sessine who guided her to Asura's location. Asura broadcasts to
   the world the truth regarding the encroachment and the attempts of the
   monarchy to prevent the activation of the crypt sub-systems. She
   explains her origin, being an emissary of the crypt that was combined
   with the mind of Count Sessine who sacrificed himself in the process.
   She was created by the crypt because the relevant systems were kept
   separate by their designers to prevent infection by chaos. The
   so-called chaotic elements of the crypt are a burgeoning ecology of
   Artificial Intelligences. Asura states that both the humans and chaos
   will have to learn to live with each other. Asura and Gadfium depart,
   reaching an elevator which is activated for them by Bascule after
   reaching the control room at the summit of the tower. Asura is able to
   activate the "Fearsome Engine" of the title, which begins the slow
   process of relocating the solar system out of reach of the cloud.
