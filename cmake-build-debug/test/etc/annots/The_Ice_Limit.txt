   Meteorite hunter Nestor Masangkay arrives on Isla Desolacion, an island
   near Cape Horn in Chile, tracking a possible meteorite. Using a
   tomographic scanner, Masangkay confirms that not only is there a
   meteorite present under the ground, but that it is incredibly massive.
   Excited, Masangkay digs down to unearth a small portion of the
   meteorite and is subsequently killed in a flash of light.

   Some months later, Masangkay's equipment is recovered by a Yaghan
   native and eventually makes its way to New York billionaire Palmer
   Lloyd, a collector of rare and exotic archaeological artifacts. Wanting
   the meteorite for his soon-to-be-opened museum, Lloyd hires Masangkay's
   former partner, Sam McFarlane, to confirm the meteorite's existence and
   assist in its recovery. He also hires Effective Engineering Solutions,
   Inc., a high-priced "problem solving" firm, to design a plan for the
   unprecedented task of recovering and transporting what has been
   confirmed by McFarlane to be the largest meteorite ever discovered.

   Eli Glinn, the president of EES, puts together a comprehensive plan to
   effect the recovery, accounting for literally every complication he
   deems possible. To effect this plan he composes a team to augment
   Lloyd's personnel, notably including Rachel Amira, EES's brilliant yet
   grating mathematics expert, and Sally Britton, an out-of-work
   supertanker captain whose last ship crashed while she was drunk and on
   duty. Despite Britton's public image as a dangerous alcoholic, analysis
   by EES has led Glinn to peg her as professional, talented, and
   motivated never to fail again. After meeting her in person, Glinn finds
   himself becoming attracted to her.

   Glinn's expedition sets off for Cape Horn in a brand new oil
   supertanker, the Rolvaag, retrofitted with various high tech equipment
   but disguised to appear as worn down, barely functional ship, traveling
   under the guise of a failing mining company searching for iron ore.
   Despite possessing a legitimate mining agreement to this effect, Glinn
   is forced to bribe local Chilean officials for access to Isla
   Desolacion, falsely confessing that they are searching for gold in
   order to allay any further suspicions. Both of these actions are
   witnessed by Commandante Vallenar, a locally stationed Chilean Navy
   officer, who objects angrily but is powerless to stop the bribes from
   being accepted.

   Once on Isla Desolacion, operations start almost immediately. The body
   of Masangkay is recovered and analyzed by the expedition's doctor, who
   concludes that he was killed by a lightning strike; McFarlane
   attributes this to the meteorite acting as a lightning rod. Once
   properly examined, the meteorite is shown to be much smaller -- and
   denser -- than initially expected. However, when Glinn's crew attempts
   to lift the meteorite using hydraulic jacks the units fail, killing two
   members of the expedition. Tests McFarlane run on a sample of the
   meteorite reveal that the exterior of the meteorite is a single
   element, not an alloy, and has an approximate atomic number of 177.
   Though this explains why the jacks failed -- the weight of the
   meteorite is somewhere in the area of 25,000 tons, more than double
   what was expected -- it is also staggering scientific discovery: no
   known element has an atomic number anywhere near 177. McFarlane
   speculates that this element is part of the undiscovered elemental
   "island of stability", and further states that the meteorite could only
   have come from outside the solar system. During this time, McFarlane
   also becomes romantically involved with Amira.

   Now properly accounting for its weight, Glinn's crew is able to load
   the meteorite onto a massive cart which will move the meteorite to the
   Rolvaag. That evening, Commandante Vallenar sends a member of his crew,
   Timmers, to investigate Glinn's excavation. Timmers infiltrates the dig
   site, kills a guard, and enters the area housing the meteorite.
   Surprised by what he discovers, Timmers reaches out to touch the
   meteorite and is fatally electrocuted. Though confused at first, the
   expedition eventually is able to piece together what happened,
   concluding that the meteorite discharges electricity on contact. Plans
   to move the meteorite continue, albeit much more carefully. At the same
   time, Commandante Vallenar positions himself off the coast of Isla
   Desolacion to prevent the Rolvaag from leaving. Glinn meets with the
   Commandante in an attempt to secure safe passage, admitting that the
   expedition is there to recover a meteorite, but is rebuffed by
   Vallenar.

   The next evening Glinn and his crew load the meteorite onto the ship
   under cover of fog, leaving lights and running equipment on Isla
   Desolacion to serve as a distraction, then break for the open sea. When
   Commandante Vallenar fires on the Rolvaag and gives chase Glinn
   detonates two explosive devices surreptitiously placed on the
   Commandante's propellers during his visit, disabling the Chilean ship.
   This proves to be a temporary solution, as Vallenar's crew is able to
   replace one of the damaged propellers. By this time the Rolvaag is well
   on its way to international waters, and Glinn predicts that Vallenar
   will not pass the Chilean border (however, the doctrine of hot pursuit
   appears to allow this). When the Commandante continues pursuing them,
   Glinn belatedly realizes that Timmers must have been Vallenar's son;
   Vallenar has realized that Timmers is dead and intends to kill them out
   of vengeance. Captain Britton also notes that Vallenar's course has now
   cut them off from any chance of help. With no other choice, Glinn
   orders the ship to proceed south towards the Ice Limit, the border of
   Antarctic waters, where icebergs and even ice islands are common.

   During the Rolvaag's flight the meteorite discharges again, though this
   time without anyone touching its surface. Eventually McFarlane and
   Amira figure out what causes the electrical discharges: contact with
   salt-containing liquids such as human sweat or ocean water. Meanwhile,
   Vallenar's ship closes on the Rolvaag over the course of several hours,
   getting into firing range just as the ship enters an area of icebergs.
   Though Captain Britton is able to avoid destruction by feigning the
   ship being in distress, eventually Vallenar inflicts enough damage to
   disable the ship completely. As his vessel closes between two ice
   islands to destroy the Rolvaag, a team of Glinn's men detonate
   explosives on one of the towering icebergs, shearing off a massive
   chunk of ice which capsizes and sinks the Commandante's ship.

   Though no longer pursued by the Chilean Commandante, the Rolvaag is now
   dead in the water, and the nearest rescue vessel is unable to approach
   for several hours due to a storm in the area. The continuing rough seas
   begin to take their toll on the ship; eventually Captain Britton
   realizes that the meteorite is severely unbalancing the ship, and must
   be jettisoned to prevent the Rolvaag from being snapped in half. At
   first both Palmer Lloyd and Sam McFarlane object vehemently to the
   idea, but after some argument admit that it may be the only way to save
   the ship and themselves. Glinn prepares to activate the jettisoning
   system, but abruptly stops, declaring that he is certain the ship will
   survive. Attempts to convince him otherwise fail, and as he is the only
   person with access to the system the crew has no choice but to abandon
   ship. Glinn moves to the meteorite holding area, attempting to secure
   the meteorite, only to discover that most of the securing devices have
   failed. Undaunted, he continues his efforts until he is interrupted by
   Captain Britton, who begs him to leave the ship with her in a lifeboat,
   confessing, "I could love you, Eli." Moments later the meteorite makes
   contact with the ocean, discharging a massive amount of electricity.

   McFarlane, Amira, Lloyd, and the rest of the crew watch from the
   lifeboats as the Rolvaag snaps in half and sinks. The lifeboats are
   ill-prepared for the harsh Antarctic waters, and many of the crew start
   to suffer from hypothermia immediately. The survivors take refuge on an
   ice island, where they start to slowly succumb to the extreme
   conditions. Amira attempts to tell McFarlane something she concluded
   about the meteorite, giving him a CD containing the test data they
   collected, but before she can finish she dies. McFarlane begins to slip
   away as well, but before he can the crew is rescued by a helicopter.

   Three days later, Palmer Lloyd and the handful of survivors are
   recovering inside a British Antarctic science station. Sam McFarlane
   arrives in Lloyd's room and begins to tell him about Amira's attempts
   to tell him about her discovery. Though Lloyd refuses to engage him,
   McFarlane continues speaking, describing a series of small ocean floor
   earthquakes recorded at a specific Antarctic location, and then
   revealing that the Rolvaag sank at the same location. He finishes by
   saying that he has figured out what Amira wanted to say: that what they
   recovered was not a meteorite, it was a seed, and that it is now
   sprouting.
