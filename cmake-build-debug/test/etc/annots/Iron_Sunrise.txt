   Martin Springfield and Rachel Mansour return to Earth to recuperate
   following the events of Singularity Sky. However, Rachel is quickly
   called upon to explain the administrative expenses she incurred during
   her previous assignment. Shortly thereafter she finds herself
   negotiating with a lunatic believing himself to be a reincarnation of
   Idi Amin and in possession of an armed nuclear device which, in the
   black humor typical of the series, he has threatened to detonate after
   receiving an eviction notice from his apartment.

   Meanwhile, a young and hopeful planetary civilization is murdered by
   the apparent use of a causality violation device which causes their sun
   to explode without warning (the "iron sunrise" of the title), and their
   defense systems to deploy automatically against the homeworld of the
   suspected perpetrators of the atrocity.

   Rachel and Martin set off to investigate these events and prevent the
   assassination of the remaining members of the murdered civilization's
   leaders, who can abort the retaliation strike. In the background the
   Eschaton continues to play its own game.
