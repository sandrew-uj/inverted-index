   Four years after the events on Isla Nublar, an upper-class British
   family docks their yacht and has come ashore on nearby Isla Sorna,
   unaware that the island contains genetically engineered dinosaurs.
   Their daughter wanders off and is attacked by a group of Compsognathus,
   but is saved by her father and yacht crew.

   An ailing John Hammond invites disgraced mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm
   to his residence to discuss the recent incident. Hammond's company
   InGen, which created the dinosaurs, is now headed by Hammond's nephew
   Peter Ludlow, who used the incident to take control of the company from
   Hammond. Ian learns that InGen originally cloned the dinosaurs on Isla
   Sorna, but the island was abandoned during a hurricane and the animals
   were released into the wild to fend for themselves. Ludlow wants to
   exploit the island's creatures to save InGen from bankruptcy. Hammond
   asks Ian to join a team who will document the dinosaurs in their
   natural habitat, in order to encourage a policy of non-interference.
   Ian's girlfriend, paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding, was hired and is
   already on Isla Sorna. Upon hearing this, Ian reluctantly agrees to go
   to the island, but only to retrieve Sarah.

   Ian travels there with Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and
   engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian and activist. They
   find Sarah amidst a herd of Stegosaurus, but she is insistent on
   staying to continue her research. Ian is shocked when he discovers that
   his daughter Kelly has stowed away with the team in a trailer, which
   serves as their mobile base. Ludlow and a mercenary team arrive on the
   island to capture dinosaurs, with help from big-game hunters Roland
   Tembo and Ajay Sidhu, Roland's second-in-command Dieter Stark, and
   paleontologist Dr. Robert Burke.

   Malcolm's group realizes that Ludlow and the InGen team are planning to
   take the captured specimens back to the mainland and to an unfinished
   Jurassic Park attraction in San Diego, which Hammond abandoned in favor
   of the park on Isla Nublar. Nick and Sarah free the captured dinosaurs,
   allowing the animals to wreak havoc across the InGen team's camp. On
   the way back to the trailer, Nick rescues an injured Tyrannosaurus rex
   infant that Roland tried to use as bait to hunt its male parent. Nick
   and Sarah treat the infant for a broken leg, but the Tyrannosaurus
   adults arrive. They reclaim their infant, destroy the trailer, and
   devour Eddie during his attempt to rescue the group.

   Ian, Sarah, Nick, and Kelly are subsequently rescued by Ludlow's team,
   and are forced to work together with them after learning that they've
   lost all their communicative equipment as well. They elect to walk
   en-masse to a distant abandoned InGen base to call for help. During a
   break, Stark goes into the wilderness alone to relieve himself and is
   killed by a group of Compsognathus. After the team sets up a camp for
   the night, they are ambushed by the Tyrannosaurus adults: Burke is
   devoured, and everyone else flees into a field of long grass containing
   a pack of Velociraptors, where Ajay and the others are all killed.

   Ian, Sarah, Kelly, and Nick manage to reach the InGen base, fight off
   three Velociraptors, and successfully radio for helicopter extraction.
   After being rescued, Nick reveals that he stole Roland's ammunition to
   prevent him from killing his intended trophy, but while passing
   overhead, they notice that Roland sedated the male Tyrannosaurus. As
   more InGen personnel arrive on the island to secure the male and the
   infant, Roland declines a job offer at the San Diego park from Ludlow,
   reflecting on Ajay's death and the morality of Ludlow's scheme.
   The male Tyrannosaur on his rampage through San Diego.

   In San Diego, Ian and Sarah attempt to meet with Ludlow in order to
   prevent him from unveiling the attraction. Before they can do this, the
   ship carrying the male Tyrannosaurus suddenly crashes into the docks.
   The crew is found dead, and the Tyrannosaurus is accidentally released
   and it begins to roam freely through the city, causing major traffic
   disruptions, eating a family's dog and killing a man who sought refuge
   in a store. Ian and Sarah locate the infant at the attraction and
   retrieve it, using it to lure the male back to the docks. Ludlow
   pursues the couple onto the ship, and tries to catch the infant within
   the cargo hold, but he is cornered by the male, which breaks his leg,
   incapacitating him before being mauled to death by the infant. Sarah
   uses a tranquilizer gun to sedate the male, while Ian seals the cargo
   hold doors.

   In the aftermath, with both dinosaurs on their way back to Isla Sorna
   (with a naval escort) and Ian, Sarah and Kelly in their home, Hammond
   appears in a televised news interview to announce that the American and
   Costa Rican governments have declared the island a nature preserve.
