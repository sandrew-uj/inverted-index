   Andy Warner is a zombie, having reanimated after a fatal car wreck that
   killed his wife, orphaned his daughter, and left Andy disfigured and
   unintelligible. Reviled and discriminated against by a society that no
   longer considers him human, Andy is an outcast. He spends his new
   existence watching cable television in his parents' wine cellar and
   attending Undead Anonymous meetings with other zombies, where he finds
   kindred souls in Rita and Jerry. After they meet Ray, a rogue zombie
   who introduces them to the joys of consuming human flesh, Andy embarks
   on a journey of self-discovery that leads to a media-driven,
   class-action lawsuit on behalf of the rights of zombies everywhere.
