   The novel centers on Glawen Clattuc, an intelligent, capable young man.
   Glawen's father Scharde foils an attempt by an old family enemy,
   Spanchetta Clattuc, to falsely inflate Glawen's "index number" and
   thereby reduce his chances of achieving Agency status. He joins Bureau
   B, the department responsible for enforcing the laws of the Charter.

   Glawen becomes romantically involved with the beautiful Sessily Veder.
   When Sessily disappears, an investigation suggests she was raped and
   murdered, her body shipped off-planet in a wine cask. However, there is
   insufficient evidence to convict the primary suspect, Spanchetta's son
   Arles.

   Later, Glawen becomes acquainted with and attracted to Wayness Tamm,
   the daughter of the new Conservator. Glawen saves Wayness from a rape
   attempt by Arles. Then, after the murder of her brother (engineered by
   a Yip), Wayness reveals to Glawen that while she was visiting Earth,
   her father's cousin became the secretary of the nearly moribund
   Naturalist Society and discovered that the Charter was missing (a
   previous secretary had been a thief and sold the society's assets).
   Whoever possesses it is the legal owner of Cadwal. She decides to
   return alone to Earth to search for it.

   Glawen is ordered by Bureau B chief Bodwyn Wook to join the Bold Lions
   (a boisterous drinking club for devil-may-care youths) and travel to
   Yipton with them on an annual jaunt, using the opportunity to spy on
   the Yips. He is accompanied by Kirdy Wook, a Bold Lion and also a
   Bureau B agent. Glawen discovers that the Yips are secretly assembling
   a flyer (a flying vehicle), most likely to further their goal of
   seizing Deucas. However, Glawen is spotted. He gets away, but Kirdy is
   caught and tortured by the Yips. With great difficulty, Bodwyn Wook
   secures his release. Although Kirdy recovers physically, his mind is
   severely affected, and Glawen senses that Kirdy nurtures an intense
   irrational hatred for him.

   Glawen travels to a small island for a holiday. To his horror, he
   discovers that "parties" are being held there in which rich
   off-worlders are allowed to have their way with young Yip girls, who
   are then killed. An outraged Bodwyn Wook has them arrested, but is
   persuaded to allow the wealthy prisoners to pay very large fines
   instead of being executed in order to pay for desperately needed flyers
   and weapons to counter the Yip threat.

   He sends Glawen off-world to discover the identity of the organizers
   and, to Glawen's disquiet, orders that Kirdy accompany him. Kirdy
   eventually betrays Glawen, who is imprisoned by a sect which believes
   in total equality of the sexes. Their extreme stance has led to a
   declining population. Their leader informs Glawen that he is to be a
   sex slave to remedy the situation. It turns out some of the sect
   members had participated in the "parties" in a prior attempt to solve
   their dilemma. After six months, Glawen manages to escape and shut down
   the sect.

   He then returns to Cadwal and finally identifies Sessily's murderer:
   Kirdy Wook. Kirdy had been jealous of Glawen from childhood. Kirdy
   attempts to kill Glawen on a beach, but Glawen lures him out into the
   water; a weak swimmer, Kirdy is dragged out to sea by the undertow and
   drowns.

   Glawen has also uncovered the organizer of the sex parties. Floreste is
   an dramatist who will go to any lengths to fund his dream: the
   construction of a magnificent new Orpheum. Condemned to death, Floreste
   refuses to divulge any information until Glawen threatens to sue and
   seize his hard-won funds as damages. Glawen's father Scharde, a senior
   Bureau B agent, is missing and presumed dead in an accident while on
   patrol, but Floreste confirms that he is actually a prisoner. He also
   inadvertently gives Glawen startling news as to who is really leading
   the Yips.
