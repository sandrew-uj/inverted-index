   Firedrake is a young dragon who lives in a hidden valley in Scotland
   with other dragons. After realizing that humans intend to flood the
   valley and the dragons living there are no longer safe, Firedrake sets
   off with the guidance from the eldest member of his clan (Slatebeard)
   to avoid the "Golden One" and to find the Rim of Heaven, a legendary
   location that is a safe haven for all dragons.

   Firedrake travels to Hamburg with his friend Sorrel, a forest brownie,
   to find Gilbert Graytail, a rat who specializes in making maps. The duo
   meets Ben who provides Sorrel with human clothes so she may go in
   disguise to find Gilbert while Firedrake stays hidden. After finding
   Gilbert and providing payment, Gilbert hands over a map leading to the
   Himalayas, marking dangerous areas along the way. Only able to fly at
   night, Firedrake wastes no time wanting to leave. He and Sorrel also
   decide to bring Ben along with them. After Ben and Sorrel argue about
   turning East too soon or not, the three end up in a mountain range full
   of dwarves. Firedrake sleeps while the sun is up and the dwarves wait
   for him to wake up. While he rests however, one of the dwarves,
   Gravelbeard, runs to the castle in that same mountain range, revealing
   Nettlebrand, the Golden One, a fearsome dragon-like monster whose only
   purpose in life is to hunt, kill and eat dragons and his servant,
   Twigleg the Homunculus. After hearing of the trio, Nettlebrand decides
   to follow them, hoping to hunt down and kill the last of the dragons
   because he failed decades before.

   Firedrake, Sorrel and Ben fly onward, but are soon swept off course by
   a storm, arriving on the shore of Egypt. Encountering a basilisk and a
   band of zealous archaeologists, the party eventually befriends a kindly
   scientist named Professor Greenbloom. Sorrel is initially suspicious
   but soon warms up to him. Professor Greenbloom gives Ben one of two
   freezing-cold metallic scales he has, which unknown to the humans, once
   belonged to Nettlebrand. Twigleg relays the news to Nettlebrand, who
   immediately makes his way to the dig site to find Professor Greenbloom
   and recover the scales. Meanwhile, the three searchers set out on the
   advice of the professor to seek the advice of a Djinn, whose thousand
   eyes can see everything. Ben succeeds in fulfilling the Djinn's arcane
   requirements with the question: "Where does the Rim of Heaven lie?" The
   answer to the question appears in two of the Djinn's thousand eyes; it
   is a path, marked by the Indus River, by a mountain range, and by a
   monastery. Beyond this monastery is the Rim of Heaven. In the
   monastery, Ben must break the moonlight on the stone dragon's head. The
   Djinn also gives them a prophecy: "When that day comes, twenty fingers
   will point the way to the Rim of Heaven, and silver will be worth more
   than gold."

   Meanwhile, Nettlebrand tracks down Greenbloom, who managed to escape
   him. Twigleg is discovered but is allowed to stay due to his
   almost-perfect ability to understand and translate any language. He has
   grown to be very attached to Ben, and he begins relaying false
   information to his master, sending him into the middle of a desert
   where he got attacked by the sandmans, who the monster eventually
   escapes from. While flying over the ocean, a lunar eclipse occurs and
   Firedrake (who lives off of moonlight), cannot fly. He falls and lands
   on the back of an initially frightening but amiable sea serpent. She
   agrees to take the friends to Pakistan, where they will rendezvous with
   a Dracologist, Zubeida Ghalib. She alone knows a way to help Firedrake
   fly without moonlight. Along the way, the Serpent tells them (among
   other things) about Nettlebrand and his army of red-eyed Ravens. As the
   peaceful voyage atop Serpent-back continues, they are spotted by one of
   Nettlebrand's raven spies. Annoyed, Sorrel throws a stone which she has
   smeared her adhesive saliva. The stone sticks to the Raven's wing and
   sends him panicking to shore. In Pakistan, the friends enter a village
   where Zubeida the Dracologist is living and also find Professor
   Greenbloom. His wife and daughter, Guinevere, have joined him on
   account of the incident with Nettlebrand. Deeply worried, the two
   parties compare their findings, which all point to a single grim
   fact--Nettlebrand is hunting the Dragons who live in the Rim of Heaven,
   and expects Firedrake to find them for him.

   Dr. Ghalib reveals a legend of a Dragon Rider who once lived in the
   village. Ben is his reincarnation, and his destiny is to save the
   silver dragons from a terrible enemy. No sooner have they heard the
   legend than two more of Nettlebrand's ravens descend on them. Sorrel
   attempts the saliva trick again, with one variation: a few sparks of
   Dragon-fire are added to the mix. The stones do not adhere, but the
   Ravens are indeed changed before the eyes of all, into a few crabs.
   This new strangeness on the part of Nettlebrand disturbs the searchers,
   ultimately inducing Twigleg to reveal his original intentions as
   Nettlebrand's spy. He also reveals Nettlebrand's origin--an alchemist
   created Nettlebrand as a dragon killing machine to obtain the Dragons'
   horns which he used in his experiments to create gold. Twigleg, and his
   eleven other Homunculus brothers, were made as Nettlebrand's
   caretakers. When the Silver Dragons went into hiding, Nettlebrand
   killed the alchemist and eventually ate all of Twigleg's brothers, then
   went hunting on his own.

   Zubeida showed Firedrake not only the tomb of the original Dragon
   Rider, but also a species of flower which collects moonlight in the
   form of dewdrops on its leaves. Having drunk this "moon-dew", Firedrake
   is able to fly even if there's no moon at all. The two parties split up
   to lose Nettlebrand's pursuit in the mountains. After a hazardous
   encounter with a Roc, they are forced off course and must take refuge
   in a valley. Nettlebrand continues tailing a boat wherein are Professor
   Greenbloom and his family, knowing they will lead him to Firedrake, but
   is seen by Guinevere.

   In the valley, help comes to Firedrake and company in the form of Lola
   Graytail, Gilbert's niece. Lola had been cartographing the country for
   her uncle and she guides them to the monastery. There, they are
   welcomed by the monks, who look on Firedrake as a bringer of good
   fortune. Also it is here that Ben "breaks the moonlight"--- actually a
   moonstone kept by the monks for this purpose. Ben shatters the
   moonstone and summons the aid of a four-armed brownie, named
   Burr-Burr-Chan. He agrees to guide Firedrake, Sorrel, Twigleg, and Ben
   to the Rim of Heaven. He warns, however, that Firedrake's kin have
   degenerated into earthbound cowards as a result of hiding from
   Nettlebrand. Whilst waiting for the moment of departure, the company
   discover Gravelbeard (who was threatened by Nettlebrand into becoming
   another spy) but fail to catch him. They fly on their way swiftly, with
   Nettlebrand in pursuit. To Twigleg's dismay, in the center of the Rim
   of Heaven is a great lake, a perfect gateway for Nettlebrand, who can
   travel instantaneously by water. To make sure that he is right, Lola
   takes Twigleg in her miniature airplane to investigate and distract
   Nettlebrand, while above the others seek the Dragons' cave. There, they
   meet with a she-Dragon, Maia. She is the only living dragon there, as
   the other twenty-two have since turned into stone through lack of
   moonlight.

   Outside, Lola and Twigleg found Gravelbeard. In the struggle that
   follows, the Dwarf's hat (which functions as an altitude compensator),
   is taken by Twigleg. Promptly Gravelbeard is struck with mountain
   sickness, allowing himself to be taken a prisoner. Nettlebrand, who now
   knows their location, is coming. No one knows how they could ever stop
   him since he is twenty times as strong as one dragon as well as immune
   to other dragons' firepower. In disgust, Sorrel spits on the golden
   scale which the Professor gave to Ben. Inspired by his success with the
   Ravens, Firedrake breathes fire on it and reduces it to gold paint.
   Twigleg comes up with a plan. He pretends to be still loyal to
   Nettelbrand and frees Gravelbeard then sent him back to Nettlebrand.
   The Golden One, elated by upcoming success, orders the Dwarf to polish
   his armor. Unfortunately for Nettlebrand, the armor polish has been
   replaced with Brownie spits. When Nettlebrand enters the cave, he was
   at once dive-bombed by Firedrake, Maia, and Lola in her plane. At last,
   the Dragons came together and set Nettlebrand afire. The Brownie spits
   reacted at once, dissolving Nettlebrand's armor and destroying him.
   Nettlebrand melts to reveal nothing but a toad underneath. As the
   company stare in wonder at this transformation, Gravelbeard enters. He
   has seen the marvelous gemstones and rock formations in the cave, and
   wishes to enhance them with his own skill, revealing that doing so will
   bring the petrified dragons back to life. Within a few days, all the
   silver dragons are awakened again. Firedrake and Maia went flying with
   Sorrel and Burr-Burr-Chan to bring the other members of their species
   back home. Ben and Twigleg went to live with Professor Greenbloom and
   his family. Two months later, news reached the humans that Firedrake
   has convinced the silver dragons to come with him to the Rim of Heaven.
   Eager to see their friends again, Ben and Guinevere occupy their time
   with other investigations of "imaginary" creatures until they can visit
   the silver dragons again.
