   The living dead continue to hold dominion over the earth but the
   scattered remnants of human civilization have reorganized enough to
   establish protected outposts across the United States. One such outpost
   in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, contains a feudal-like
   government. Bordered on two sides by rivers and on the third by an
   electrified fence guarded by a militia, the city has become a sanctuary
   in which its citizens live in relative security. Outside the city's
   barriers is a no-man's-land of barren countryside and dilapidated
   suburban towns long deserted by living humans but overrun with legions
   of walkers. The rich and powerful live in a luxury high-rise called
   Fiddler's Green, while the rest of the population subsists in squalor.
   All forms of commerce within the protected zone are controlled by Paul
   Kaufman, the city's ruthless plutocratic ruler. He has sponsored Dead
   Reckoning, an armored personnel vehicle that can travel through the
   zombie-infested areas with ease.

   Riley Denbo is the designer and commander of Dead Reckoning. Unlike
   Kaufman, Riley is respected for his work in protecting the citizens, as
   well as providing them with food and medical supplies that the citizens
   can no longer safely acquire themselves. Using Dead Reckoning, Riley
   and his crew venture into areas overrun with zombies to scavenge for
   necessary supplies. They also retrieve luxury items such as designer
   clothing and top shelf brands of liquor as these things offer a
   powerful means of barter within Kaufman's oppressive oligarchic regime.
   On one mission, they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent
   behavior. This was especially seen in one such zombie, "Big Daddy",
   formerly a gas station attendant. During the mission, rookie Mike is
   bitten by a zombie and commits suicide before he turns.

   After the mission, Riley retires from commanding Dead Reckoning. Grown
   weary of a hard-scrabble life in a post-apocalyptic city, he plans to
   leave the urban sanctuary for the open road to Canada once repairs on
   his car are finished. Back in the city, he visits Chihuahua's bar.
   There, he sees a prostitute named Slack being forced into a cage with
   some zombies to entertain guests. Riley and Charlie save Slack; Charlie
   kills Chihuahua in the ensuing chaos. Riley, Charlie and Slack are
   arrested. Slack reveals that Kaufman ordered her execution, for helping
   Mulligan to instigate rebellion among the poor.

   Meanwhile, Cholo DeMora, Dead Reckoning's second in command, is denied
   an apartment in Fiddler's Green despite his service to Kaufman. In
   retaliation, Cholo takes over Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy
   Fiddler's Green with it if Kaufman does not comply. Kaufman approaches
   Riley and tasks him, as well as Charlie and Slack, to retrieve Dead
   Reckoning. They are supervised by Manolete, Motown, and Pillsbury.

   On the way, Manolete is bitten and then killed by Slack. After catching
   up with Dead Reckoning, Riley approaches the vehicle alone. Charlie,
   Slack, and Pillsbury follow him after subduing Motown and leaving her
   behind. Realizing Riley is working for Kaufman, Cholo holds both Riley
   and Charlie at gunpoint. As he prepares to fire Dead Reckoning's
   missiles at Fiddler's Green, Riley uses a small device and deactivates
   Dead Reckoning's weapons systems; he then destroys the device. Motown,
   who had regained consciousness, opens fire and nearly kills both Riley
   and Cholo (who is maimed by one of the gunshots). She is bitten by a
   zombie and killed by Slack. Riley convinces Cholo to allow him to
   escape North and to join him, but the latter decides to return to
   Fiddler's Green to deal with Kaufman; his partner Foxy accompanies him.
   While en route, Cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill Kaufman
   by himself. Riley takes over Dead Reckoning once again and returns to
   Fiddler's Green.

   Elsewhere, Big Daddy (who has gathered a large group of zombies) learns
   that they can walk safely underwater, and leads the zombies across the
   river to the human city where they breach a section of the perimeter
   fence. Hopelessly outnumbered, the border guards abandon their posts.
   As a result of the zombies swarming into the once secure areas of the
   city, the electrified fences that once kept the zombies out have now
   become a wall to trap them and the humans inside. Seeing the city
   overrun, Kaufman runs with his money, and encounters a zombie Cholo in
   the parking garage. As the two struggle, Big Daddy kills both with an
   exploding propane tank.

   Riley's group arrives at the city only to come upon a raised
   drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but a small group of
   zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to
   dispose of and evade the zombies. After crossing the bridge, they
   helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is
   too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then
   revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan,
   thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning
   goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and
   the zombies leaving the city, sparing the surviving humans, Riley
   decides to leave them alone as well as the zombies do the same, citing
   that they are just looking for a place to go, too. While lighting up
   the rest of the fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the
   zombies, but are now useless since they do not distract the horde
   anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.
