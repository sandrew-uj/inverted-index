   A disastrous solar event in 2019 and 2020 leaves the world devastated,
   with only small pockets of human survivors scratching out a living in a
   bleak, irradiated world. Largely fuelled by the stockpiles of hardware
   left behind by a dead civilization combined with the desperation of a
   new world order, the gladiatorial deathsports begin, around 2035. The
   vast expanses of wilderness between the towns are menaced by gangs of
   road pirates armed with heavily armed cars and trucks, and travelled by
   equally well armed trade groups, making a living by carrying food,
   fuel, and other specialist equipment between the towns.
