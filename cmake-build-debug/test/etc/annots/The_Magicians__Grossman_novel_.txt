   Quentin Coldwater is a high school student from Brooklyn who, along
   with best friends James and Julia, attends an advanced school. He loves
   a series of books called "Fillory and Further", which involve the
   children of the Chatwin family discovering a Narnia-esque land called
   Fillory. On the day of his Princeton interview, Quentin instead
   transported to Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy, the only school
   for magic in North America. He passes the tests and interviews is
   accepted as one of twenty new students.

   After beginning his studies at Brakebills, it becomes apparent to
   Quentin that magic is difficult and tedious to learn. The curriculum
   involves learning many old and lost languages, and innumerable hand
   positions. Despite this, Quentin and his classmates Penny and Alice are
   allowed to move up a year by compressing their first year of studies.
   Penny fails the special exam and stays behind, then later fistfights
   Quentin out of jealousy. One day during class, a bored Quentin tampers
   with a spell and an otherworldly horror referred to as "the Beast"
   enters Brakebills. It eats a student before the faculty are able to
   drive it away.

   Third year students are assigned a Discipline. Although Quentin's
   Discipline does not manifest itself to the teachers, he and Alice are
   sorted into the Physical magic group. The Physical Kids also include
   Eliot, Josh, and Janet, who are a year above them. During the spring
   semester of their fourth year, they are all sent to Brakebills South in
   Antarctica where they practice in silence and isolation. There, Quentin
   and Alice begin a relationship. During a summer vacation, Quentin is
   confronted by Julia about Brakebills. She reveals that she took the
   entrance exam at the same time as Quentin, but failed. As per protocol,
   her memory was wiped of magic's existence or the school itself, but it
   did not work correctly and she has become deranged and obsessed with
   learning magic. Quentin tells her the school's location, hoping she
   will have her memory properly erased.

   Upon graduation, Quentin and the other Physical Kids live in Manhattan
   and spend their days and nights in hedonistic pursuits, still looking
   for a purpose. Quentin drunkenly sleeps with Janet, abruptly ending his
   relationship with Alice. Penny arrives with news about travel between
   worlds: he has left Brakebills early after spending his time on
   specialized study of the Neitherlands, a realm between the worlds.
   Fillory is real; Penny has come into possession of a button that will
   allow others to travel there with him.

   The magicians enter Fillory and search for a quest, finding it more
   dangerous and divided than the books indicated. Eventually, they set
   out for Ember's tomb to retrieve the crown of Martin Chatwin, the
   eldest child from the "Fillory and Further" books, to establish
   themselves as the new Kings and Queens of Fillory. They are disturbed
   by the violent trials they endure before meeting Ember, the ram god of
   Fillory, in the tomb. However, the group learn that Ember has been
   weakened and is being kept prisoner in the tomb, and his brother,
   Umber, is dead. Against Ember's instructions, Quentin blows a
   mysterious horn, which summons the Beast; he is revealed to be Martin
   Chatwin, who sacrificed his humanity in order to stay in Fillory
   forever and has taken over. He intends to destroy the button so he can
   never be banished. After a brutal fight, in which Penny's hands are
   eaten, Alice sacrifices herself to kill Martin.

   Six months later, Quentin awakes after a long recovery in the care of
   Fillorian centaurs. The other magicians have returned to Earth, fearing
   that Quentin would never awaken from his coma. Penny chose to remain in
   the Neitherlands, entering a mysterious library. Quentin becomes
   depressed and disillusioned, especially when Jane, the youngest
   Chatwin, visits and reveals herself to be the Watcherwoman, previously
   thought to be a villain. By using a time-traveling device, Jane pulled
   the strings throughout her siblings' and Quentin's stories, finally
   succeeded in killing Martin by leading Quentin and his friends to the
   confrontation. Quentin then travels Fillory to hunt down the Questing
   Beast, but it is unable to grant his wishes to bring back Alice and
   heal Penny's hands. Quentin wishes to return to Earth.

   Quentin chooses to denounce magic, feeling that power and his search
   for purpose have only caused problems. Brakebills sets him up in a
   high-paying office job in New York where he remains depressed and
   aimless. One day, Eliot and Janet show up with Julia, who has learned
   magic, asking Quentin return to Fillory with them to become Kings and
   Queens. They encourage him to accept that everyone, including Alice,
   were responsible for their own choices on the quest. Quentin joins
   them.
