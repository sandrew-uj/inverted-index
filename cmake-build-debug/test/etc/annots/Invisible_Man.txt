   Ellison says in his introduction to the 30th Anniversary Edition
   that he started to write what would eventually become Invisible Man in
   a barn in Waitsfield, Vermont, in the summer of 1945 while on sick
   leave from the Merchant Marine. The book took five years to complete
   with one year off for what Ellison termed an "ill-conceived short
   novel." Invisible Man was published as a whole in 1952. Ellison had
   published a section of the book in 1947, the famous "Battle Royal"
   scene, which had been shown to Cyril Connolly, the editor of Horizon
   magazine by Frank Taylor, one of Ellison's early supporters.

   In his speech accepting the 1953 National Book Award, Ellison said that
   he considered the novel's chief significance to be its "experimental
   attitude." Before Invisible Man, many (if not most) novels dealing
   with African Americans were written solely for social protest, most
   notably, Native Son and Uncle Tom's Cabin. By contrast, the narrator in
   Invisible Man says, "I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either,"
   signaling the break from the normal protest novel that Ellison held
   about his work. Likewise, in the essay 'The World and the Jug,' which
   is a response to Irving Howe's essay 'Black Boys and Native Sons,'
   which "pit Ellison and  Baldwin against  Wright and
   then," as Ellison would say, "gives Wright the better argument,"
   Ellison makes a fuller statement about the position he held about his
   book in the larger canon of work by an American who happens to be of
   African ancestry. In the opening paragraph to that essay Ellison poses
   three questions: "Why is it so often true that when critics confront
   the American as Negro they suddenly drop their advanced critical
   armament and revert with an air of confident superiority to quite
   primitive modes of analysis? Why is it that Sociology-oriented critics
   seem to rate literature so far below politics and ideology that they
   would rather kill a novel than modify their presumptions concerning a
   given reality which it seeks in its own terms to project? Finally, why
   is it that so many of those who would tell us the meaning of Negro life
   never bother to learn how varied it really is?"

   Placing Invisible Man within the canon of either the Harlem Renaissance
   or the Black Arts Movement is difficult. It owes allegiance to both and
   neither at the same time. Interestingly enough, Ellison's own
   resistance to being pigeonholed by his peers bubbled over into his
   statement to Irving Howe about what he deemed to be a relative vs. an
   ancestor. He says, to Howe: "...perhaps you will understand when I say
   that he  did not influence me if I point out that while one can
   do nothing about choosing one's relatives, one can, as an artist,
   choose one's 'ancestors.' Wright was, in this sense, a 'relative';
   Hemingway an 'ancestor.' " And it was this idea of "playing the field,"
   so to speak, not being "all-in," that lead to some of Ellison's more
   staunch critics. The aforementioned Howe, in "Black Boys and Native
   Sons," but also the likes of other black writers such as John Oliver
   Killens, who once denounced Invisible Man by saying: "The Negro people
   need Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man like we need a hole in the head or a
   stab in the back. ... It is a vicious distortion of Negro life."

   Ellison's "ancestors" included, among others, The Waste Land by T.S.
   Eliot. In an interview with Richard Kostelanetz, Ellison states
   that what he had learned from the poem was imagery, and also
   improvisation techniques he had only before seen in jazz.

   Some other influences include William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway.
   Ellison once called Faulkner the South's greatest artist. Likewise, in
   the Spring 1955 Paris Review, Ellison said of Hemingway: "I read him to
   learn his sentence structure and how to organize a story. I guess many
   young writers were doing this, but I also used his description of
   hunting when I went into the fields the next day. I had been hunting
   since I was eleven, but no one had broken down the process of
   wing-shooting for me, and it was from reading Hemingway that I learned
   to lead a bird. When he describes something in print, believe him;
   believe him even when he describes the process of art in terms of
   baseball or boxing; he's been there."

   Some of Ellison's influences had a more direct impact on his novel as
   when Ellison divulges this, in his introduction to the 30th anniversary
   of Invisible Man, that the "character" ("in the dual sense of the
   word") who had announced himself on his page he "associated, ever so
   distantly, with the narrator of Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground".
   Although, despite the "distantly" remark, it appears that Ellison used
   that novella more than just on that occasion. The beginning of
   Invisible Man, for example, seems to be structured very similar to
   Notes from Underground: "I am a sick man" compared to "I am an
   invisible man".

   Arnold Rampersad, Ellison's biographer, expounds that Melville had a
   profound influence on Ellison's freedom to describe race so acutely and
   generously.  "resembles no one else in previous fiction
   so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick." Ellison signals his debt
   in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of
   truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service:
   "Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of
   Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most
   black, brother, most black...'" In this scene Ellison "reprises a
   moment in the second chapter of Moby-Dick", where Ishmael wanders
   around New Bedford looking for a place to spend the night and enters a
   black church: "It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about
   the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and
   teeth-gnashing there." According to Rampersad, it was Melville who
   "empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary
   tradition" by his example of "representing the complexity of race and
   racism so acutely and generously" in Moby-Dick.

   Other most likely influences to Ellison, by way of how much he speaks
   about them, are: Kenneth Burke, Andre Malraux, Mark Twain, to name a
   few.
