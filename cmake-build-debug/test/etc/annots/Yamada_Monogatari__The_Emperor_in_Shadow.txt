   Protagonist Yamada no Goji is a minor nobleman of Heian period Japan,
   who aided by his associate, the lapsed Buddhist priest Kenji,
   investigates supernatural mysteries as a demon hunter.

   As a result of his successful defense of Minamoto no Yoshii from
   assassination by magic, Lord Yamada has received his own estate in
   Kamakura, and has devoted his attention to restoring the fortunes of
   his previously disgraced clan. He is called back into public affairs by
   his patron Prince Kanemore to escort Princess Tagako back to the
   capital from her sinecure as head of a provincial temple. Secretly, he
   is also tasked with protecting her from supernatural threats aimed at
   destabilizing the regime of the new emperor, Sanjo.

   Yamada and Kenji have their work cut out for them as the attempts on
   the princess's life escalate with every effort to trace the source of
   the plot--and Prince Kanemore has mysteriously disappeared.
