   There is no detailed information on the planning, composition, and
   printing of the Confessions. It was perhaps being contemplated in
   August 1823 when Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine included Hogg's article
   on 'A Scots Mummy', most of which was to be incorporated in the
   novel. More definitely, on 25 October Owen Rees of Longmans wrote:
   'We will with pleasure undertake the publication of "Memoirs of a
   Suiside " on the same plan as we have done your other works':
   Longmans had recently brought out The Three Perils of Man and The Three
   Perils of Woman. A further Longmans letter suggests that the manuscript
   may have been ready by 12 December. Negotiations over the exact
   title continued into early 1824, and printing was complete by early
   June.
