   In a Tibetan lamasery, the monks seek to list all of the names of God.
   They believe the Universe was created for this purpose, and that once
   this naming is completed, God will bring the Universe to an end. Three
   centuries ago, the monks created an alphabet in which they calculated
   they could encode all the possible names of God, numbering about
   9,000,000,000 ("nine billion") and each having no more than nine
   characters. Writing the names out by hand, as they had been doing, even
   after eliminating various nonsense combinations, would take another
   15,000 years; the monks wish to use modern technology to finish this
   task more quickly.

   They rent a computer capable of printing all the possible permutations,
   and hire two Westerners to install and program the machine. The
   computer operators are skeptical but play along. After three months, as
   the job nears completion, they fear that the monks will blame the
   computer (and, by extension, its operators) when nothing happens. The
   Westerners delay the operation of the computer so that it will complete
   its final print run just after their scheduled departure. After their
   successful departure on ponies, they pause on the mountain path on
   their way back to the airfield, where a plane is waiting to take them
   back to civilization. Under a clear night sky they estimate that it
   must be just about the time that the monks are pasting the final
   printed names into their holy books. Then they notice that "overhead,
   without any fuss, the stars were going out."
