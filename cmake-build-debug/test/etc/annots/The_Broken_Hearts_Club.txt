   The film follows the lives of a group of gay friends in West Hollywood.
   Among the group is Dennis (Timothy Olyphant), a photographer who often
   holds the group together; Cole (Dean Cain) a handsome, charismatic
   actor who -- often unwittingly -- ends up with other people's
   boyfriends; Benji (Zach Braff), the youngest member of the group, with
   a penchant for gym-bodied men, who finds himself going through some bad
   times; Howie (Matt McGrath), a psychology student who is known for
   overthinking every situation; Patrick (Ben Weber), the cynic of the
   group; and Taylor (Billy Porter), who has just broken up with his
   long-term boyfriend.

   Guiding them is restaurant owner Jack (John Mahoney) who provides them
   with advice and jobs for some of them who work part-time as servers at
   his restaurant. But when tragedy strikes, and the group's newest
   member, 23-year-old Kevin (Andrew Keegan), attempts to fit in, their
   friendships are put to the test.

   The film also stars Nia Long, Mary McCormack and Justin Theroux, and
   features a cameo by Kerr Smith, who knew the director through their
   work on Dawson's Creek and enjoyed the script so much he asked to be a
   part of it, and Jennifer Coolidge as the hairdresser Betty, that all
   the guys, with the exception of Howie, go to for hair therapy.
