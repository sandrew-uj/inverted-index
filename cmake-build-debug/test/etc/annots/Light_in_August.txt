   Photograph of a real planing mill in the 1930s, similar to the one
   depicted in the novel.

   The novel is set in the American South in the 1930s, during the time of
   Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation in the
   South. It begins with the journey of Lena Grove, a young pregnant white
   woman from Doane's Mill, Alabama, who is trying to find Lucas Burch,
   the father of her unborn child. He has been fired from his job at
   Doane's Mill and moved to Mississippi, promising to send word to her
   when he has a new job. Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older
   brother for her illegitimate pregnancy, Lena walks and hitchhikes to
   Jefferson, Mississippi, a town in Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha
   County. There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing
   mill, ready to marry her. Those who help her along her four-week trek
   are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found, or that he will keep his
   promise when she catches up with him. When she arrives in Jefferson,
   Lucas is there, but he has changed his name to Joe Brown. Looking for
   Lucas, sweet, trusting Lena meets shy, mild-mannered Byron Bunch, who
   falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe
   Brown. Thoughtful and quietly religious, Byron is superior to Brown in
   every way, but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to
   Lena.

   The novel then switches to the second plot strand, the story of Lucas
   Burch/Joe Brown's partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic
   Christmas has been on the run for years, ever since at least injuring,
   perhaps even killing his strict Presbyterian adopted father. Although
   he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American
   ancestry. Consumed with rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders
   between black and white society, constantly provoking fights with
   blacks and whites alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior
   to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where
   Byron, and later Joe Brown, works. The job at the mill is a cover for
   Christmas's bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition.
   He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who
   descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town
   despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at
   first, Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion, which frustrates
   and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship with Christmas,
   Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is
   murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.

   The novel leaves readers uncertain whether Joe Christmas or Joe Brown
   is the murderer. Brown is Christmas' business partner in bootlegging
   and is leaving Joanna's burning house when a passing farmer stops to
   investigate and pull Joanna's body from the fire. The sheriff at first
   suspects Joe Brown, but initiates a manhunt for Christmas after Brown
   claims that Christmas is black. The manhunt is fruitless until
   Christmas arrives undisguised in Mottstown, a neighboring town; he is
   on his way back to Jefferson, no longer running. In Mottstown, he is
   arrested and jailed, then moved to Jefferson. His grandparents arrive
   in town and visit Gail Hightower, the disgraced former minister of the
   town and friend of Byron Bunch. Bunch tries to convince Hightower to
   give the imprisoned Joe Christmas an alibi, but Hightower initially
   refuses. Though his grandfather wants Christmas lynched, his
   grandmother visits him in the Jefferson jail and advises him to seek
   help from Hightower. As police escort him to the local court, Christmas
   breaks free and runs to Hightower's house. A childishly cruel white
   vigilante, Percy Grimm, follows him there and, over Hightower's
   protest, shoots and castrates Christmas. Having redeemed himself at
   last, Hightower is then depicted as falling into a deathlike swoon, his
   whole life flashing before his eyes, including the past adventures of
   his Confederate grandfather, who was killed while stealing chickens
   from a farmer's shed.

   Before Christmas' escape attempt, Hightower delivers Lena's child in
   the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder,
   and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch to come and see her. Brown deserts
   Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight.
   Brown beats the braver, smaller Bunch, then skillfully hops a moving
   train and disappears. At the end of the story, an anonymous man is
   talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to
   Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not
   the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted
   search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.
