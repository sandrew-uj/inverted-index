   In September 1987, Dr. Julian Whittlesey is leading an expedition
   through the Amazon Basin, in the Brazilian rainforest, in search of the
   lost Kothoga tribe. He hopes to prove that they still do exist and in
   the process learn more about their culture, including their lizard god
   Mbwun ("He Who Walks On All Fours"), supposedly the son of Satan.
   However, Whittlesey disappears after finding the mutilated body of his
   partner, Crocker, and realizes that a creature in the bush is stalking
   him. A year later, in Belem, a dock worker named Ven is suddenly and
   brutally killed when a freighter arrives with a shipment of crates from
   Whittlesey's expedition.

   Seven years later, in a fictionalized version of New York City's
   American Museum of Natural History, two young boys are found dead in a
   museum stairwell, having gotten lost in the late hours of the museum.
   NYPD Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta leads the subsequent investigation. He
   has the museum under tight lockdown and its staff placed under curfew,
   for fear the murderer is still hiding somewhere in the museum or the
   many catacombs that run underneath it. The three prominent leaders of
   the museum - curator Winston Wright, deputy head Ian Cuthbert, and
   public relations director Lavinia Rickman - all try to keep the murders
   under wraps, as the grand gala opening of the new "Superstition"
   exhibition, led by George Moriarty, draws nearer, an event that will
   feature many wealthy benefactors as well as Mayor Harper. Rickman even
   hires The New York Times reporter Bill Smithback, Jr. to cover the
   murder investigation but repeatedly edits his reports so they will
   appear more favorable towards the museum and its leadership. Assistant
   Curator Gregory Kawakita jokingly begins spreading the rumor of the
   "Museum Beast", a legendary monster that has allegedly been roaming the
   tunnels under the museum for years and is responsible for the murders.
   Although the rumors are initially dismissed as myth, D'Agosta is
   shocked during the autopsy to discover a claw buried in one of the
   boy's brains.

   When a security guard suffers a similarly brutal death, FBI Special
   Agent Aloysius Pendergast arrives to aid in the investigation, having
   taken a personal interest in the unique nature of the kills. The
   investigation intensifies as the gala draws nearer, with the search
   spreading to the tunnels under the museum. Margo Green and her mentor,
   Dr. Whitney Frock, initially take little to no interest in the
   investigation, but Pendergast eventually approaches them when he
   realizes the claw from the autopsy matches the claws on a Mbwun
   figurine that had been sent back to the museum in a crate in 1987 and
   is set to be put on display in the new exhibition. Green, with
   Smithback's help, manages to get into the secure vault and gain access
   to some letters that Whittlesey had sent to a museum colleague named
   H.C. Montague, detailing the struggles the 1987 expedition had been
   going through. Pendergast then reveals the primary reason for his
   interest in the case: the nature of the murders of the two boys and the
   security guard matches the murder of the Brazilian dock worker in 1988,
   as well as several other dock workers in Louisiana later that year.
   Pendergast was able to trace back to the one connection among the
   museum murders, the Louisiana murder, and the Belem murder: the
   shipment of crates Whittlesey had sent the museum in 1987. However,
   other than one smaller crate containing the Mbwun figurine, the crates
   were empty, save massive quantities of local plant leaves apparently
   used as packaging. Frock reveals that those crates have been moved into
   the heavily reinforced secure vault as well, and after Green and
   Smithback's stunt to get the letters, the directors are well aware of
   their intentions and will never allow them access to the crates.
   Pendergast hints at the possibility that the murders might not have
   been committed by a human, and that the Mbwun monster may somehow have
   been sent to the museum by Whittlesey's shipment.

   Reading through more of Whittlesey's letters, Green and Smithback
   discover one other major colleague of Whittlesey's who is still working
   at the museum, and to whom one of the letters was addressed, Dr.
   Jorgensen. They ask Jorgensen about the nature of the expedition and
   its aftermath. Jorgensen explains that Whittlesey was determined to
   prove that the Kothoga tribe had not gone extinct, and that he had
   found it at long last on a tepui deep in the Brazilian jungle. In
   addition, Whittlesey had apparently discovered a unique plant at the
   base of the tepui that had some kind of protein-like quality to it.
   However, Whittlesey was being accompanied by a museum bureaucrat simply
   identified as "Maxwell", whose job was to hinder Whittlesey's progress
   so that the find would not collide with the local government's
   discovery of an undisclosed natural resource that had been discovered
   on the tepui. Determined to mine the entire area, the government
   dropped napalm on the tepui in 1988, killing all of the remaining
   Kothoga and destroying the plant. Jorgensen also reveals that
   Whittlesey's colleague Montague had disappeared rather suddenly several
   years ago. Green and Frock soon realize that the plant Whittlesey
   discovered was the same plant that had been sent back as packaging in
   the crates, and that Whittlesey had never sent the crates back to the
   museum empty; that the main content of the crates was the plant itself.
   The day of the gala, Green and Frock then begin running computer
   analyses on samples of the plant as well as the claw from the autopsy.
   The results reveal that the plants are rich in thalamoid hormones,
   which can also be found in the human hypothalamus gland, though to a
   much lesser extent. After reviewing the autopsy reports, Green realizes
   that what all of the murders - in the museum and in Louisiana and
   Brazil - all had in common was that the hypothalamus had been ripped
   out of the victim's heads and was completely missing. The analysis of
   the claw creates a general caricature of the creature in the question,
   comprising a primary mix of primate, reptile, and human genes; a
   nocturnal nature; a strong sense of smell; a quadruped build; a maximum
   speed of 60-70 km/h; and thick muscle definition and bone structure.
   Frock describes this hypothetical combination as having the strength of
   a grizzly bear, the speed of a greyhound, and the intelligence of a
   human being - the ultimate predator. Frock and Green finally discover
   the truth behind the entire ordeal, but their efforts to warn their
   superiors before the gala are thwarted.

   As the investigation ultimately did not produce a suspect, the gala is
   allowed to begin, with a tightened security presence by the NYPD and
   the FBI, under the official command of Special Agent Coffey. The
   exhibition initially appears to be going fine until the body of NYPD
   officer Fred Beauregard drops down from the rafters above the
   exhibition and right into the crowd, causing a mass panic. At the same
   time, an NYPD officer named Waters, assigned to monitor the museum's
   security control room, hears a strange noise in the generator room
   (revealed to be merely the air conditioner pump) and opens fire, only
   to completely destroy the central switching box and shut down the
   museum's power. This results in the museum's massive, metal security
   doors automatically closing, separating the museum into five cells and
   trapping a group of guests, staff, and security personnel alike inside
   the museum. When the chaos settles, dozens of people have either been
   killed by the stampeding crowd or crushed by the closing doors, and the
   roughly three dozen who are trapped inside the area where the
   exhibition is includes D'Agosta, Smithback, Cuthbert, Wright, Rickman,
   Mayor Harper, museum security director Ippolito, and NYPD officer John
   Bailey. Coffey and Kawakita manage to make it outside the museum, while
   Green, Frock, and Pendergast are all in the tunnels under the museum,
   and all three soon encounter the creature. Pendergast manages to fire a
   single shot, which simply bounces off the creature's skull.

   Pendergast manages to communicate with D'Agosta via radio, to warn him
   about the creature, and explains that the best way for the trapped
   crowd to escape is down through the museum tunnels, which eventually
   lead to the sewer systems of New York. The three directors refuse to
   head down into the tunnels, and instead retreat into Wright's office on
   the fourth floor. Just as D'Agosta prepares to lead the crowd down the
   first stairwell, the creature attacks and kills Ippolito and an injured
   guest. The rest of the crowd manages to escape down into the tunnels.
   Although extremely skeptical of the consistent reports of a creature's
   being responsible, Coffey eventually orders a SWAT team to descend into
   the museum through the skylights, to eliminate the creature. The Mbwun
   then enters the office where the three directors are hiding, and
   Cuthbert sends Rickman and a now-drunk Wright into the adjacent
   dinosaur area to safety, while he draws a pistol to make a stand.
   However, the creature suddenly leaves him alone and pursues the other
   two, killing both of them. Cuthbert is rescued by the SWAT team shortly
   before they move in to attack the creature, only for the entire team to
   be slaughtered.

   The crowd manages to navigate the tunnels and reaches the sewers just
   before the creature returns, killing Bailey. They then reach a massive
   underground chamber that is filled with skeletons and torn meat,
   presumably the creature's lair. They struggle to stay above the rising
   water as the storm outside intensifies, and another woman is dragged
   away by the current and dies, shortly before the crowd finally reaches
   a manhole and escapes back out onto the streets of New York. Pendergast
   and Green devise a plan to make a final stand against the creature,
   with Pendergast hoping to use his old hunting techniques of shooting
   the creature's legs in order to stop its charge. However, the shots do
   not penetrate the hide, and the creature closes in. At the last second,
   Green shouts for Pendergast to shoot through the creature's eye,
   allowing the bullet to pass straight through the skull and into the
   brain, which kills it instantly.

   In the epilogue four weeks later, Green, Frock, Kawakita, Pendergast,
   D'Agosta, and Smithback all convene in Frock's office to discuss the
   events of that night. Pendergast explains everything in great detail:
   the Kothoga legend claimed that Mbwun was given to them by Satan in
   order to slay their enemies in battle, when in actuality, the Kothoga
   created the Mbwun by feeding a human the strange plant that Whittlesey
   had discovered and shipped back to the museum. Eating the plant
   resulted in the human subject's undergoing the transformation process
   into the creature known as Mbwun, larger, faster, stronger, and
   slightly smarter. However, the Mbwun subsequently needed a consistent
   supply of the plant in order to survive, like an addictive drug. When
   the tepui where the Kothoga and Mbwun lived was completely destroyed,
   the Mbwun knew the last surviving samples of the plant were in the
   crates Whittlesey had shipped back, and thus, it followed the crates
   all the way to New York. It initially lived off the plants in a steady
   ration for years, and in the process, killed Montague one day when he
   came down to investigate the crates. Montague's disappearance was
   marked by a puddle of blood by the crates, but when it was discovered
   by Cuthbert, Wright, and Rickman, they washed it away to preserve the
   museum's reputation. As part of the cover-up, the crates were moved
   into the heavily fortified vault, moving them permanently out of the
   Mbwun's reach. Thus, in order to stay alive, it needed the next best
   substitute: the human hypothalamus. Though it tried its best to keep
   its existence a secret by living off smaller animals and homeless
   people in the sewers, it eventually turned to the murders of the boys
   and the security guard. Even during the police investigation, it could
   no longer deny its appetite, and thus ran amok during the exhibition.
   Pendergast also reveals that among the bodies that were found in the
   lair were the remains of Moriarty and a pendant that Whittlesey had
   always worn on him, serving as proof that the creature killed both of
   them. Cuthbert has since been institutionalized, Coffey was demoted and
   sent to the Waco field office, and Smithback reveals that he will
   release a book on the entire event, with half of the money going to a
   memorial fund for the late Bailey and his family.

   In his lab, Kawakita has realized an horrific truth; the creature
   didn't kill Whittlesey and take his pendant as a trophy, it actually
   WAS Whittlesey. He speculates that the Kothoga, having failed with
   Mbwun using their own people, had decided to feed the plant to a white
   man instead, hoping the resulting creature would be easier to control.
   The gamble failed, and Whittlesey was able to survive on the plants for
   years before their destruction, and he followed his own samples back
   home to the museum. Thanks to the samples that survived and were
   analyzed, Kawakita manages to develop a drug that would turn the users
   into addicts first, then into Mbwun. He begins selling it on the
   street, reflecting that the Kothoga's problem had been that Mbwun was
   able to feed on the plants himself whenever he wanted, and so they had
   no hold over it. Now, as the only person alive capable of making the
   drug, the creatures would never turn on him; he would have total
   control over the creatures and succeed where the Kothoga failed.
