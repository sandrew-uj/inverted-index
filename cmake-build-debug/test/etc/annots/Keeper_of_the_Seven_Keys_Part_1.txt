   Kai Hansen stepped away from doing vocal duties as he had difficulties
   singing and playing the guitar at the same time during the previous
   tour. It was an album dominated by Hansen, due to iillness of
   co-guitarist Michael Weikath which prevented him from performing on
   much of the album. "Future World" was released as a single and a music
   video was made for "Halloween" but with 8 minutes omitted from the
   song. The band originally planned to release Keeper of the Seven Keys:
   Part I and Part II as a double album, but their record label refused,
   insisting that the albums be released separately. In 1993, both albums
   were released as a double CD set with bonus tracks.
