   The storyline alternates between the present year of 1980 and the
   future year of 2013. In the future, Sentinels rule a dystopian United
   States, and mutants are hunted and placed in internment camps. Having
   conquered North America and hunted all mutants and other superhumans,
   the Sentinels are turning their attention to the rest of the world. On
   the eve of a feared nuclear holocaust, the few remaining X-Men, while
   making a desperate attempt to stop the Sentinels, send Kitty Pryde's
   mind backward through time, to possess the body of her younger-self and
   to prevent a pivotal event in mutant-human history and the cause of
   these events: the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly along with
   Charles Xavier and Moira MacTaggert by Mystique's newly reassembled
   Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

   Working with the present-day X-Men, Kitty Pryde's future-self succeeds
   in her mission and is pulled back to her own time, while her
   present-day-self is returned with no memory of any interim. The world
   of 2013 is not shown again in this story arc; the present-day X-Men are
   left to ponder whether their future dystopia has been averted or simply
   delayed.
