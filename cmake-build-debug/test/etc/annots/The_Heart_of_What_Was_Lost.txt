   After Ineluki the Storm King's fall in "Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn", his
   followers, the Norns, flee the lands of men and retreat north to their
   ancient city of Nakkiga. As the Norns make their way to their land in
   the Nornfells, the Rimmersman leader, Duke Isgrimnur, leads his army in
   pursuit, determined to destroy the Norns and their ancient Queen
   Utuk'ku once and for all.

   The book is told from three points of view: Duke Isgrimnur of
   Rimmersgard; a Norn leader, Viyeki; and Porto, a Perdruinese mercenary.
