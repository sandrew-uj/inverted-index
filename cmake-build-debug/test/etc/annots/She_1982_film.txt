   Set 23 years after a nuclear war called "The Cancellation," in a land
   of warring tribes, the film follows Tom and his friend Dick, whose
   sister Hari has been captured by a powerful tribe, the Norks. Tom and
   Dick set out to find and rescue Hari, attempting to avoid the dangerous
   tribes they see along the way. They are ultimately captured by a
   matriarchal clan called the Urechs, led by "She" (Sandahl Bergman). The
   two manage to escape; She's forces track them down, but She decides to
   help them in their quest after hearing the prophecy from a local seer.
   She and her lieutenant Shanda join Tom and Dick on their travels.

   They encounter many other tribes, each led by their own
   post-apocalyptic `god,' with the encounters usually ending in a battle.
   One psychic communist, Godan, can levitate his enemies but is betrayed
   by his 2nd in command, a woman in red who is upset Godan has taken She
   as a lover. Each tribal `god' has an army of mutants, with special
   abilities apparently granted by the nuclear radiation. The heroes
   also have to face a tutu-wearing giant, toga-wearing werewolves, high
   society vampires, and mutants bandaged up like Egyptian mummies. Over
   the course of these encounters, the group becomes separated, and they
   make their way separately to the Nork fortress.

   After being captured by the swastika-wearing Norks, She, Tom, and Dick,
   all masked, are forced into a free-for-all gladiator combat battle.
   Fortunately, after dispatching the other combatants, the three
   recognize each other and stop the fight. Hari, who has been a concubine
   of the Nork leader, rushes to their side. The Nork leader considers
   this an affront, and tells the party that they may leave, but that as
   punishment his forces will attack and enslave the Urechs the next day.

   They are released, but She decides to mount an ambush of the Nork
   forces at a bridge, before the Norks can even get close to Urech lands.
   Tom, Dick, and Hari aid her in setting numerous traps. When the Nork
   forces arrive, the party faces wave after wave of wildly costumed
   combatants. As the Norks finally begin to overwhelm them, the party is
   rescued when Shanda and a squad of Urech warriors arrive and rout the
   remaining Norks. Finally victorious, the group celebrates. Dick and
   Shanda, She's 2nd in command, have fallen in love, and Dick elects to
   stay with the Urechs. Tom and She silently decide to love each other
   from a distance. As Tom takes a barge with his sister Hari into the far
   away other lands, a song about Eternal Love plays in the background.
