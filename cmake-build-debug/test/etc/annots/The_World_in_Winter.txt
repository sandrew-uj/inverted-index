   The story involves a new ice age hitting Europe, British refugees
   fleeing to Nigeria, and what a later group find when they return.

   As the story opens, Andrew Leedon, a London-based television
   documentary producer, is given a new story to research: an Italian
   scientist, Fratellini, has proposed an imminent fall in solar radiation
   for the forthcoming few years which may lead to harsher winters. Leedon
   meets with David Cartwell, a Home Office civil servant and useful
   source, to see if he can find out more. Cartwell quickly becomes a
   close friend of Leedon, but also begins an affair with Leedon's wife,
   Carol.

   The winter of that year is, as predicted, long and harsh, but by
   January is it becoming clear to insiders that the solar downturn is
   worse than Fratellini had calculated and no upturn is in sight. By
   March, food stocks are becoming dangerously low, rationing has been
   imposed and the Government imposes martial law. Those in the know,
   including Andrew's estranged wife, sell up and move south to the
   tropics and countries such as Nigeria. Leedon stays behind, as inner
   London is finally cordoned off from the rest of the UK to protect the
   seat of power - an area called the London Pale - as the rest of the
   country is abandoned to starvation and barbarism.

   Finally Leedon is persuaded both by Carol and by David Cartwell to exit
   the country while safe passage is still possible. Taking with him
   Cartwell's wife Madeleine, he moves to Lagos in Nigeria, finding that
   the tables have now turned - white refugees fleeing from the ice-bound
   northern countries are living in slums, unemployed or with only menial
   jobs, and penniless, as African governments have withdrawn recognition
   of currencies such as Sterling and no longer recognize the British
   Government, with reason, as it no longer exercises sovereignty over its
   own land.

   A ray of hope arrives for Leedon as Abonitu, a young Nigerian whom
   Leedon had treated with kindness and generosity one evening in London,
   finds him and in turn helps him and Madeleine out of the slum. Abonitu
   plans a reconnaissance expedition back to Britain.
