   A young aviator, Carlos Martin (played by Raul Roulien), is dumped by
   his girlfriend (Gloria Stuart), and heads on a solo flight across the
   Pacific Ocean. He has engine trouble and makes an emergency landing on
   an uninhabited island out in the Pacific. Shortly afterward, a global
   epidemic of a new disease called masculitis kills every fertile male
   human on the planet. When efforts to cure the disease fail, the human
   race is doomed. Humanity's institutions are all run by women, including
   the Chicago underworld. Carlos escapes the island, and once he returns
   home and hears the news, it now depends on him to continue the human
   race.
