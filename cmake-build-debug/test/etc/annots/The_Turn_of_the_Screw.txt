   On Christmas Eve, an unnamed narrator and some of their friends are
   gathered around a fire. One of them, Douglas, reads a manuscript
   written by his sister's late governess. The manuscript tells the story
   of her hiring by a man who has become responsible for his young niece
   and nephew following the deaths of their parents. He lives mainly in
   London but also has a country house in Essex, Bly. The boy, Miles, is
   attending a boarding school, while his younger sister, Flora, is living
   in Bly, where she is cared for by Mrs. Grose, the housekeeper. Flora's
   uncle, the governess's new employer, is uninterested in raising the
   children and gives her full charge, explicitly stating that she is not
   to bother him with communications of any sort. The governess travels to
   Bly and begins her duties.

   Miles returns from school for the summer just after a letter arrives
   from the headmaster stating that he has been expelled. Miles never
   speaks of the matter, and the governess is hesitant to raise the issue.
   She fears there is some horrible secret behind the expulsion, but is
   too charmed by the boy to want to press the issue. Soon after, around
   the grounds of the estate, the governess begins to see the figures of a
   man and woman whom she does not recognize. The figures come and go at
   will without being seen or challenged by other members of the
   household, and they seem to the governess to be supernatural. She
   learns from Mrs. Grose that the governess's predecessor, Miss Jessel,
   and another employee, Peter Quint, had had a close relationship. Before
   their deaths, Jessel and Quint spent much of their time with Flora and
   Miles, and the governess becomes convinced that the two children are
   aware of the ghosts' presence.

   Without permission, Flora leaves the house while Miles is playing music
   for the governess. The governess notices Flora's absence and goes with
   Mrs. Grose in search of her. They find her on the shore of a nearby
   lake, and the governess is convinced that Flora has been talking to the
   ghost of Miss Jessel. When the governess finally confronts Flora, the
   girl denies seeing Miss Jessel, and asks not to see the new governess
   again. Mrs. Grose takes Flora away to her uncle, leaving the governess
   with Miles, who that night at last talks to her about his expulsion.
   The ghost of Quint appears to the governess at the window. The
   governess shields Miles, who attempts to see the ghost. The governess
   tells Miles he is no longer controlled by the ghost, and then finds
   that Miles has died in her arms.
