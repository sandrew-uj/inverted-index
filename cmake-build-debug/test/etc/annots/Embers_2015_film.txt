   Embers tells the story of those who, a decade after a global epidemic,
   remain and suffer from lasting effects of the virus - retrograde and
   anterograde amnesia. The survivors navigate a decaying landscape,
   unable to recall the past or create new memories. Five interwoven
   stories each explore a different facet of life without memory in a
   future that has no past.
