   Film footage from a news crew shows a story about an immigrant man
   killing his wife and son before committing suicide. The son and wife
   turn into zombies and kill several medical personnel and police
   officers, but leave one medic and a reporter bitten before being
   killed. The narrator, Debra, explains that most of the footage, which
   was recorded by the cameraman, was never broadcast.

   A group of young film studies students from the University of
   Pittsburgh are in the woods making a horror film along with their
   faculty adviser, Andrew Maxwell, when they hear news of an apparent
   mass-rioting and mass murder. Two of the students, Ridley and Francine,
   decide to leave the group, while the project director Jason goes to
   visit his girlfriend Debra (the narrator). When she cannot contact her
   family, they travel to Debra's parents' house in Scranton,
   Pennsylvania. En route Mary runs over a reanimated Pennsylvania State
   Trooper and three other zombies. The group stops and Mary attempts to
   kill herself. Her friends take her to a hospital, where they find the
   dead becoming zombies, and thereafter fight to survive while traveling
   to Debra's parents.

   Mary becomes a zombie and is slain by Maxwell. Later Gordo is bitten by
   a zombie and soon afterward dies from it. His girlfriend Tracy begs the
   others not to shoot him immediately but later is forced to shoot him
   herself. Soon they are stranded when their vehicle's fuel line breaks.
   They are attacked by zombies while Tracy repairs the vehicle with the
   assistance of a deaf Amish man named Samuel. Before escaping, Samuel is
   bitten and kills himself and his attacker with a scythe.

   Passing a city, they are stopped by an armed group of survivors, the
   leader being a member of the National Guard. There, Debra receives a
   message from her younger brother, who informs her that he and their
   parents were camping in West Virginia at the time of the initial
   attacks and are now on their way home. The students then leave for
   Debra's house.

   Their only reliable source of information is now the Internet, aided by
   bloggers. When they arrive at Debra's house, they find her reanimated
   mother and brother feeding on her father. They escape from the house
   and are stopped by different National Guardsmen, who rob them, leaving
   them only their weapons and their two cameras. They arrive at Ridley's
   mansion, where Ridley explains that his parents, the staff, and
   Francine were killed and he buried them out back. Ridley shows Debra
   and Tony that he "buried" his parents, the staff and Francine by
   dumping their bodies into his family's swimming pool.

   Ridley then abandons Debra and Tony and is revealed to have been bitten
   by a zombie himself, explaining his odd behavior. Ridley soon dies,
   comes back as a zombie, kills Eliot, and attacks Tracy and Jason. Jason
   is able to distract Ridley long enough for Tracy to escape at last
   minute. Mad at Jason for not leaving the camera to help her, Tracy
   leaves the group in the group's RV. The remaining survivors hide in an
   enclosed shelter within the house, with the exception of Jason, who
   left the group to continue filming and is subsequently attacked and
   infected by Ridley. Maxwell kills Ridley with an antique sword and
   Debra euthanizes Jason, while continuing to film. Later, a large number
   of zombies begin to attack the mansion, forcing the survivors to take
   shelter in the mansion's panic room.

   Debra watches Jason's recording of a hunting party shooting people who
   were left to die and be reanimated as shooting targets, and wonders if
   the human race is worth saving.
