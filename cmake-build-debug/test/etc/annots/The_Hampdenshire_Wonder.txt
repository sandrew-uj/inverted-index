   The Hampdenshire Wonder is a 1911 science fiction novel by J. D.
   Beresford. It is one of the first novels to involve a wunderkind. The
   child in it, Victor Stott, is the son of a famous cricket player. This
   origin is perhaps a reference to H.G. Wells's father Joseph Wells. The
   novel concerns his progress from infant to almost preternaturally
   brilliant child. Victor Stott is subtly deformed to allow for his
   powerful brain. One prominent, and unpleasant, character is the local
   minister. As Beresford's father was a minister, and Beresford was
   himself partially disabled, some see autobiographical aspects to the
   story. However this is unproven.

   What is more concrete is that the story of Christian Heinrich Heineken
   was an inspiration for the story. Whether the biography of that child
   prodigy was accurate or not, "the Lubeck prodigy" is mentioned in the
   work. In the original version, the progressionist ideas of Henri
   Bergson on evolution were a significant influence.
