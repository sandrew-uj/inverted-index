   The Uglies series is set at least three centuries in the future, after
   current civilization was destroyed by a bacterium which de-established
   all petroleum products, causing widespread chaos. The survivors of this
   disaster established cities much smaller than those currently existing,
   each of which is independently governed with limited traveling. At the
   age of sixteen, each person undergoes an operation which boosts their
   immune system and reflexes while giving them well-proportioned,
   symmetrical faces based on an international standard, so that all
   pretties look nearly identical. They are also given brain lesions which
   make them peaceful and compliant. Before they receive the operation,
   children are referred to as "uglies", and are kept separate from their
   older friends. Later operations follow to show signs of increasing age
   while maintaining their beauty, and the lesions may be removed for
   pretties entering careers which require quick thinking. Pretties who
   work for Special Circumstances, a clique which ensures the city's
   security, are given an operation to make them look terrifying, become
   very strong and fast, and have incredibly fast reflexes. Specials also
   receive brain surgery to make them feel superior to others and have
   heightened feelings of rage and euphoria.
