   Following the events of Planet of the Apes, time-displaced astronaut
   Taylor and the mute Nova ride horseback through the desert of the
   Forbidden Zone in search of a new life far away from Ape City. Without
   warning, fire shoots up from the ground and deep chasms open. Confused
   by the strange phenomenon, Taylor investigates a cliff wall and
   disappears through it before Nova's eyes. The phenomenon disappears,
   leaving Nova alone.

   Elsewhere in the Forbidden Zone, a second Earth spaceship has
   crash-landed after being sent to search for Taylor and his crew. Brent
   and his Skipper are the only survivors, though the Skipper dies shortly
   after crashing. Brent, while noting he is in the year 3955, assumes he
   has travelled to another planet. After burying his Skipper, he
   encounters Nova and notices she is wearing Taylor's dog tags. Hoping
   Taylor is still alive, he rides with her to Ape City, where he is
   shocked to discover the simian civilization. He observes the gorilla
   General Ursus leading a rally for the apes to conquer the Forbidden
   Zone and use it as a potential food source, against the objections of
   the orangutan Dr. Zaius. Brent is wounded by a gorilla soldier and
   taken by Nova to the home of the chimpanzees Cornelius and Zira, who
   treat his wound and tell him of their time with Taylor. The humans hide
   when Dr. Zaius arrives and announces that he will accompany Ursus on
   the invasion of the Forbidden Zone.

   Attempting to flee the city, Brent and Nova are captured by gorillas.
   Ursus orders they be used for target practice, but Zira helps them
   escape. They hide in a cave which Brent soon discovers is the ruins of
   the Queensboro Plaza station of the New York City Subway, realizing he
   traveled through time to Earth's post-apocalyptic future. After
   following a humming sound deeper into the tunnels, Brent becomes
   agitated and erratic and attempts to drown Nova as she drinks, quickly
   stopping and backing away to another room. Entering the remains of St.
   Patrick's Cathedral, he finds a population of telepathic humans who
   worship an ancient nuclear bomb.

   Brent and Nova are captured and telepathically interrogated by the
   telepaths' leadership under Mendez. They explain themselves to be the
   descendants of humans who survived nuclear holocaust and mutated over
   generations. While claiming to be a peaceful society despite using
   mind-control and illusion on their enemies, the mutants force Brent
   into revealing the apes' march on the Forbidden Zone; but their
   attempts to repel the invaders with illusions of fire and other horrors
   ultimately fail when Zaius sees through it. With the apes closing in,
   the telepaths plan to detonate their "Divine Bomb" as a last resort,
   holding a religious ritual during which they remove their human-skinned
   masks to reveal their mutated pale skin with prominent large veins due
   to generations of radiation exposure.

   Brent is separated from Nova and taken to a cell where he finds Taylor.
   The mutant Ongaro, explaining that they cannot let them leave the city
   alive, uses his telepathic powers to force Brent and Taylor to fight
   each other. Nova escapes her guard and runs to the cell, screaming her
   first word: "Taylor!" This breaks Ongaro's concentration, freeing Brent
   and Taylor from his control long enough for them to overpower and kill
   the mutant. Brent describes the bomb the mutants worship to have Greek
   letters Alpha and Omega on its casing, Taylor recognizing it as a
   "doomsday bomb" capable of destroying the entire planet.

   The apes invade the subterranean city, making their way to the
   cathedral; many of the mutants are either captured, killed, or found to
   have committed suicide. After Nova is killed in the midst of the chaos,
   Taylor and Brent reach the cathedral as Mendez is shot dead after
   raising the bomb into activation position. The humans attempt to stop
   Ursus from accidentally setting off the weapon, but Taylor is shot as
   his pleas to Zaius fall on deaf ears. When Brent is gunned down after
   killing Ursus, the mortally wounded Taylor curses Zaius as he collapses
   and dies bringing his hand down on the activation switch triggering the
   bomb. The scene whites out, and voiceover narration states: "In one of
   the countless billions of galaxies in the universe lies a medium-sized
   star, and one of its satellites, a green and insignificant planet, is
   now dead".
