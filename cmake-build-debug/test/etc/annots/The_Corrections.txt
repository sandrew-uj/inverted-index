   The novel shifts back and forth through the late 20th century,
   intermittently following spouses Alfred and Enid Lambert as they raise
   their children Gary, Chip, and Denise in the traditional Midwestern
   suburb of St. Jude, and the lives of each family member as the three
   children grow up, distancing themselves and living on the East Coast.
   Alfred, a rigid and strict patriarch who worked as a railroad engineer,
   has developed Parkinson's and shows increasingly unmanageable symptoms
   of dementia. Enid takes out her frustrations with him by attempting to
   impose her traditional judgments on her adult children's lives, to
   their annoyance.

   Their eldest son, Gary, is a successful but increasingly depressive and
   alcoholic banker living in Philadelphia with his wife, Caroline, and
   their three young sons. When Enid attempts to persuade Gary to bring
   his family to St. Jude for Christmas, Caroline is reluctant, and turns
   Gary's sons against him and Enid, worsening his depressive tendencies.
   In return, Gary attempts to force his parents to move to Philadelphia
   so that Alfred may undergo an experimental neurological treatment that
   he and Denise learn about.

   Also living in Philadelphia, their youngest child Denise finds growing
   success as an executive chef despite Enid's disapproval and persistent
   scrutiny of her personal life, and is commissioned to open a new
   restaurant. Simultaneously impulsive and a workaholic, Denise begins
   affairs with both her boss and his wife, and though the restaurant is
   successful, she is fired when this is discovered. Flashbacks to her
   childhood show her responding to her repressed upbringing by beginning
   an affair with one of her father's subordinates, a married railroad
   signals worker.

   The middle son, Chip, is an unemployed academic living in New York City
   following his termination as a tenure-track university professor due to
   a sexual relationship with a student. Living on borrowed money from
   Denise, Chip works obsessively on a screenplay, but finds no success or
   motivation to pay off his debts. Following a rejection of his
   screenplay, Chip takes a job from his girlfriend's estranged husband
   Gitanas, a friendly but corrupt Lithuanian government official, later
   moving to Vilnius and working to defraud American investors over the
   Internet.

   As Alfred's condition worsens, Enid attempts to manipulate all of her
   children into going to St. Jude for Christmas, with increasing
   desperation. Initially only Gary and Denise are present, Gary having
   failed to convince his wife or children, while Chip is delayed by a
   violent political conflict in Lithuania, eventually arriving late after
   being attacked and robbed of all his savings. Denise inadvertently
   discovers that her father had known of her teenaged affair with his
   subordinate, and had kept his knowledge a secret to protect her
   privacy, at great personal cost. After a disastrous Christmas morning
   together, the three children are dismayed by their father's condition,
   and Alfred is finally moved into a nursing home.

   As Alfred's condition deteriorates in care, Chip stays with Enid and
   visits his father frequently while dating a doctor, eventually having
   twins with her. Denise leaves Philadelphia and moves to New York to
   work at a new restaurant where she is much happier. Enid, freed of her
   responsibilities and long-time frustrations with Alfred, slowly becomes
   a more open-minded person, and enjoys a healthier involvement in her
   children's and grandchildren's lives, finally stating that she is ready
   to make some changes in her life.
