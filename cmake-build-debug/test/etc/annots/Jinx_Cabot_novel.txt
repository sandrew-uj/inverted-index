   Jean "Jinx" Honeychurch is a sixteen-year-old girl from Iowa. Being
   certain that she was born with bad luck, she goes to stay with her Aunt
   Evelyn and Uncle Ted in Manhattan, New York because her ex-boyfriend is
   stalking her.

   Her cousin Tory is convinced that Jean must join her coven of witches
   to add to their power. Jean denies being a witch, and refuses to join
   them. This angers Tory, causing her to seek payback. Jean also meets a
   guy both she and Tory have affection for, Zack. This along with the
   witch thing puts Tory in a blind rage and she decides to plot against
   Jinx in more ways than the walls of the preppy Chapman, where they all
   attend high school.

   At a school dance Tory flies Jean's ex to town, which sends Jean into a
   panic attack. She then returns home and Tory ties Jean up to cut her
   and drink her blood and take Jean's powers. Zack comes out and rescues
   Jean, who exposes Tory for what she really is. Then Tory is sent to
   boot camp and Jean and Zack end up dating.
