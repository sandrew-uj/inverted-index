   The plot follows Johnny, the protagonist and narrator, and his boss,
   McDunn, who are putting in a night's work at a remote lighthouse in
   late November. The lighthouse's resonating fog horn attracts a sea
   monster. This is in fact the third time the monster has visited the
   lighthouse: he has been attracted by the same fog horn on the same
   night for the last two years. McDunn attributes the monster's actions
   to feelings of unrequited love for the lighthouse, whose fog horn
   sounds exactly like the wailings of the sea monster himself. The fog
   horn tricks the monster into thinking he has found another of his kind,
   one who acts as though the monster did not even exist. McDunn and
   Johnny turn off the fog horn, and in a rage, the monster destroys the
   lighthouse before retreating to the sea. The lighthouse is
   reconstructed with reinforced concrete and Johnny finds a new job away
   from the lighthouse. Years later, Johnny returns and asks McDunn if the
   monster ever returned; it never did. McDunn hypothesizes that the
   monster will continue to wait in the depths of the world.
