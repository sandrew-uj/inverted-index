   Richard and Kahlan are contentedly enjoying Cara's marriage when a boy
   named Henrik warns them of dark things to come before scratching them
   both and running away. Soon after, Cara warns Richard that something or
   someone was watching her in her room. At first unbelieving, Richard and
   Kahlan notice the same spooky presence on their own. Shortly after
   these events, prophecies are given by the most unexpected places and
   people, but appear equally in a book titled End Notes. After failing to
   reason with the delegates alarmed by these prophecies, Kahlan and Nicci
   frighten them into silence with a prediction invented by themselves.
   Meanwhile, Richard finds a strange machine underground, bearing an
   emblem exactly as on a wordbook for translating the language of
   creation, only reversed. It is later revealed that this machine is the
   source of all the new and strange predictions, and may be an artificial
   intelligence. Among the delegates is Abbot Dreier, the representative
   of Bishop Hannis Arc of Saavedra, who becomes the antagonist of this
   book and its sequels.

   The scratch on Kahlan's arm worsens, and Zedd fails to heal it. When
   Kahlan feverishly wakes from a rest, she finds a pack of dogs
   surrounding her. A fight and chase then ensues until Kahlan runs away
   in a carriage. When Richard finds out that Kahlan is gone, he traces
   her footsteps and sends soldiers to find her. She is ultimately
   captured by a monstrous 'Hedge Maid': a macabre sorceress associated
   with necromancy. Richard tries to save Kahlan, but is himself captured.
   Richard remembers the machine's last warning, protects his and Kahlan's
   ears, and cuts the leather strips on the Hedge Maid's mouth, whereupon
   she emits a terrible shriek and dies. Richard and Kahlan are found by
   Nicci and Zedd, who take them to the Garden of Life to heal them.
