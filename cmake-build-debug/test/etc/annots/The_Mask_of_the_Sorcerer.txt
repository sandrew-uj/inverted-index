   Young Sekenre lives in the marshes of the Riverland (implied to be, or
   at least inspired by, prehistoric Egypt) together with his sister and
   parents. His father Vashtem supports the family as the local
   magician--or so it appears. Actually, Vashtem is a sorcerer attempting
   both to deny his identity and hide from his enemies, and his children
   are pawns in his plot to cheat his dark fate when it ultimately catches
   up to him. There is a difference between magicians and sorcerers; the
   former merely channel magic, while the latter embody it, at a great
   price.

   Things come to a head when Vashtem inexplicably murders his wife and
   daughter, leaving his son Sekenre to seek vengeance and understanding
   with the aid of a Sybil who has her own agenda. A quest through the
   Underworld brings son and father to their reckoning, with justice meted
   out to Vashtem only at the cost of Sekenre taking on his curse. In
   killing a sorcerer, one takes on his power and immortality, absorbing
   his soul and knowledge, along with those of all those previously killed
   by that sorcerer and his predecessors. And one takes on their enemies,
   as well.

   Physically frozen at the age of a child, Sekenre may well live forever,
   if he can master his terrifying new powers, retain his sense of self
   and morality against the haunting spirits of his evil predecessors, and
   avoid being slain by foes inherited and newly gained.
