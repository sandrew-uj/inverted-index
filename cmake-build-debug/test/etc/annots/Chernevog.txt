   Chernevog begins three years after the conclusion of Rusalka. Sasha,
   Pyetr and Eveshka are living in Uulamets' cottage; Sasha is 18 and a
   young wizard, and Pyetr and Eveshka are married. Chernevog is still
   asleep in the forest, guarded by the leshys^[a], but Sasha and Eveshka
   have disturbing dreams about him waking up. One day Sasha and Pyetr
   find that Eveshka has disappeared, and they set off to find her. They
   suspect that she may have gone to confront Chernevog, who still
   controls their lives.

   Sasha and Pyetr travel into the forest and find Chernevog still asleep.
   Pyetr tries to kill him once and for all, but an owl, a childhood
   friend of Chernevog's whom he gave his heart to, attacks Pyetr. Pyetr
   kills the owl and Chernevog regains his heart, which wakes him up.
   Chernevog had given away his heart to free his conscience, enabling him
   to practise magic freely. Sasha has learnt that Chernevog had rejected
   Uulamets' teachings of wizardry, which works within nature and
   considers the consequences of wishes, and turned to magic, which taps
   dark forces and is not concerned with laws of nature. Pyetr tries to
   kill Chernevog again, but Sasha stops him. With his heart, Chernevog's
   actions are limited and Sasha is able to control him. Sasha and Pyetr
   resume their search for Eveshka, taking Chernevog with them.

   Eveshka's reason for fleeing the house is because she knows Chernevog
   will wake up and she fears for their safety. She is drawn to a house
   occupied by her mother, Draga, whom Chernevog and murdered after he had
   had Eveshka killed. Draga and Uulamets had met when they were both
   under the tutelage of a wizard named Malenkova, but Uulamets feared her
   and ran away. Draga killed the wizard, and later, pregnant, arrived at
   Uulamets' cottage to give birth to Eveshka. Uulamets took Eveshka away
   from Draga, and fearing for her life, she ran away, leaving Uulamets
   the task of bringing up and controlling a "doubly gifted"^[10] wizard.
   Draga then found Chernevog, an abandoned child who had been abused by
   another wizard, and took him in. Chernevog was wild and appeared
   possessed, but she controlled and manipulated him, then sent him to
   Uulamets to be his student. Chernevog hated Uulamets and had killed
   Eveshka to revenge him. Chernevog then, using his new-found skills,
   hunted down and killed Draga. Over the years Draga, as a ghost, slowly
   willed herself back to life, intent on revenging her murder.

   After days looking for Eveshka, Sasha drops his guard and Chernevog
   sends his heart to Pyetr, allowing him to freely practise magic again.
   In control of both Sasha and Pyetr, Chernevog directs the search for
   Eveshka, hoping to find her before she finds Draga, whom he knows is
   alive again. Draga needs Eveshka's help in overcoming Chernevog and
   tells her that she is pregnant with Pyetr's child. She also persuades
   Eveshka to start using magic. Draga had inherited magical wolves from
   Malenkova and she divides Eveshka's consciousness amongst them,
   increasing her power. When Chernevog, Sasha and Pyetr arrive at Draga's
   house, the wolves threaten to overwhelm Chernevog. Realizing that he
   cannot defeat Draga and Eveshka's magic, Chernevog retreats and the
   wolves and Draga follow. When they reach a nearby hill, Chernevog calls
   down a lightning strike that kills him, Draga and the wolves. This
   frees Pyetr of Chernevog's heart and Eveshka from the wolves and
   Draga's control.

   Pyetr, Eveshka and Sasha return to their cottage where Eveshka gives
   birth to a daughter. But she is worried about bringing up a wizard
   child, knowing what it might do to them, and especially Pyetr, if it
   does not get its way.
