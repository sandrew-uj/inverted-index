   The book focuses on 9-year-old Peter Hatcher's frustration with the
   horrendous behavior demonstrated by his annoying 2 1/2-year-old
   brother, Farley Drexel "Fudge" Hatcher, who frequently goes unpunished.
   Peter becomes frustrated with Fudge because he often disturbs Peter's
   pet turtle, Dribble, which he won at his best friend Jimmy Fargo's
   birthday party. Furthermore, Fudge throws nonstop temper tantrums, goes
   through a finicky phase of abstaining from eating altogether, and
   emulates Peter's behavior, throwing tantrums if it is prohibited.
   Nevertheless, their parents, Warren and Anne, dote on Fudge, to Peter's
   anger and frustration.

   For months, Fudge's antics continue; breaking his front teeth after
   catapulting himself off the jungle gym at the local playground when he
   decides to fly, vandalizing Peter's school project, and taking off at a
   movie theater. One day, to Peter's absolute misery, he returns home to
   discover Dribble is missing from his bowl, Fudge claiming to have
   swallowed him. These proclamations prove to be correct, and Fudge is
   rushed to the hospital, where Dribble is extracted, to Ann's relief.
   However, Dribble has died in Fudge's stomach, and no one, especially
   Fudge, seems to care. Peter is devastated over the loss of him; Warren
   and Anne sympathetically compensate by adopting a dog, which Peter
   appropriately names "Turtle" in memory of Dribble.
