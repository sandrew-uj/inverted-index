   On 9 August 1991 Maksymilian "Max" Paradys (Jerzy Stuhr), looking for
   adventure, and Albert Starski (Olgierd L/ukaszewicz), biologist,
   volunteer themselves for the first human hibernation experiment,
   created by professor Wiktor Kuppelweiser, a Nobel Prize laureate, who
   previously successfully hibernated a chimpanzee for half a year. The
   experiment is considered as an epochal event and is broadcast on
   television. The hibernation is scheduled to last for 3 years.

   Instead of being awakened 3 years later in 1994 as planned, they wake
   up in the year 2044, in a post-nuclear world. Both are 86 years old,
   but haven't aged a day outwardly. When they wake up, they believe that
   they are in a clinic following their hibernation. They are being taken
   care of by women, which they enjoy at the beginning, especially Max,
   who becomes attracted to Lamia Reno. However they gradually realize
   that everything going on around them is odd. After explicitly asking to
   meet professor Kuppelweiser, they are informed by Lamia and Dr. Berna
   that he "doesn't exist". They explain that there was a war long ago,
   that all males have long been extinct, and that it is actually the 8th
   of March 2044 (Women's Day). Max and Albert think that these must be
   hallucinations as a side-effect of hibernation and try to leave the
   room, but receive an electric shock from the closed door. The men are
   under constant surveillance after this. Lamia informs them their
   society reproduces without males through parthenogenesis. During a
   briefing, Max kisses Lamia, for which she knocks him down and threatens
   both men with euthanasia if there is another attempt at sexual assault.
   However, the kiss causes Lamia's drug-inhibited passions to resurface,
   making her both confused and fascinated. Due to her internal feelings
   she goes on a search for the oldest living woman to find out anything
   she can about the men before the war. She finds 74-year old Julia
   Novack, who fondly remembers her fiance and tells Lamia that the old
   world with two sexes should be restored. She also guesses that Lamia
   fell in love with one of the men.

   After several days, Max and Albert are permitted to go out to meet with
   Her Excellency, the supreme ruler of women. Waiting for her in the
   bio-sanctuary, they spot a tree with two tiny apples and eat them,
   having had enough of synthetic food. At the meeting they ask what
   womankind did to mankind. The women reply the extinction of men is not
   their fault, but Kuppelweiser's, who, during the war, invented an agent
   - the so-called M bomb - which was supposed to temporarily paralyze
   male genes, but, due to an oversight, instead destroyed male genes
   permanently. Max offers a proposal: he and Albert will serve as
   reproducers to restore the male population. However, the women do not
   wish the old order to return; Her Excellency gestures to the "sacred
   apple tree" and says it was planted by Arch Mother, and from which,
   when once in paradise, a male took an apple and seduced a woman with
   it, by which act paradise was lost to all forever. After noticing the
   missing sacred apples, Her Excellency becomes desperate and enraged and
   demands the men be taken back to their previous confinement and not be
   released anywhere.

   Once again confined, the men grow distressed and plan to escape by
   damaging the electric power grid. They succeed, but are caught during a
   course organized by the special section on how to interact with men,
   should they ever return to the world, and are locked up again. The
   women provide them with their last chance: to submit themselves for
   "naturalization" - undergoing a sex reassignment surgery. When they
   refuse, the ceiling above the room opens, showing a huge assembly of
   women, who are to determine their fate. Albert and Max now face a
   humiliating trial, while the women blame males for oppression,
   virtually all evil and vices, and praise their new society. They engage
   in historical revisionism by claiming that the greatest scientists -
   such as Copernicus, Einstein and Pincus (one of the pioneers of
   parthenogenesis) - were, in fact, women. When Max and Albert are taken
   away, the assembly votes on whether the men should undergo forced
   'naturalization' (proposed by group "Archeo") or be 'liquidated'
   (proposed by group "Genetix"). Naturalization is passed by a margin of
   only one vote. In the meantime, the men escape again. Wandering through
   what Albert calls "a nightmarish skyscraper", they encounter other
   women, who have never seen a man, and therefore view Max and Albert as
   their "sisters", provoking humorous encounters. After that the men
   discover a boot lying on the floor, with a bottle of cheap wine
   (popular in Poland in the late 20th century) and a sheet of newspaper
   from 1993 with stories from the beginning of the world war. They are
   cornered by the security team and escape down a waste chute. They
   discover the nest of "decadency" - one of the anarchist, "hippie"
   women's groups, who do not wish to be part of the oppressive regime,
   playing loud music, and some engaging in lesbian relations. They
   mistake Max and Albert for government spies and, in the meantime, the
   pursuing regime forces attack, and subsequent chaos provides the men
   with an opportunity to escape. During their escape, the men stumble
   upon Lamia, who provides them with a way to see the outside - a
   periscope - and reveals that they live deep underground in expanded old
   mines. The periscope shows a dark, rocky landscape above ground, and
   sensors indicate high levels of "Kuppelweiser radiation", a side effect
   of the M bomb. However, it transpires that Lamia is loyal to "Archeo"
   group and her "help" was a ruse to capture the men and force them into
   surgery. Lamia is congratulated by Tekla and Emma Dax (members of
   "Genetix") for her ingenious plan, but they also inform her that their
   section will now be in charge of the males, which devastates Lamia.

   In the hands of Tekla, the fate of the males is to be different. Their
   organs will be extracted for transplantation, and their remains will be
   tested for possible use as a food source, due to a growing protein
   shortage. The chief surgeon, Dr Yanda, an old lady, is revealed to be
   Max's daughter, who now delights in taking revenge for his abandonment
   of his wife and child in favor of hibernation for his own profit. Lamia
   sabotages the surgery and helps the men escape as revenge for Tekla and
   Dax taking the men and her research. Shortly after escaping, Albert
   passes out in the lift from the anaesthetic given to him in theatre,
   and dreams that he's in 1994, when process of hibernation has
   successfully finished. In the periscope room Lamia threatens the guards
   by telling them that she will blast the whole block if they do not give
   her the code activating a capsule reaching the surface, while Max and
   Albert find and change into protective suits. The guards claim that
   only Her Excellency knows the password required; enraged, Max shouts
   "kurwa mac!" (a common strong Polish profanity, lit. " mother's a
   whore"), and to the surprise of all present, the capsule is activated.
   Lamia changes into another protective suit and joins the men. While
   they explore the barren surface, Max suddenly bumps against an
   invisible barrier and is unable to go further. He takes a knife and
   cuts the fabric of the barrier, revealing a dazzling light. They all go
   through the hole and find themselves on a beach, with the periscope
   area being surrounded by a small, circular tent-like structure with the
   barren landscape panorama painted on the inside of the canvas. They
   explore their surroundings and reach a forest, but the suits are
   running out of oxygen. Suddenly Max shouts with joy and throws away his
   suit, pointing skyward to a flying stork and declares "if it can live,
   it means we can live too". After removing the suits, they come across a
   cosy villa full of fresh food. While eating in the garden, they are
   found by Emma, who has been following them and, armed with a harpoon,
   demands their surrender, but she faints due to the lack of oxygen.
   Albert removes her helmet and performs CPR on her. He carries her
   inside the villa and starts to remove her suit. When she regains
   consciousness, Emma begins to fight with Albert; during their struggle,
   they accidentally turn on the TV and see an official government
   broadcast of events, stating that Lamia and Emma are dead and including
   an interview with "naturalized" Max and Albert, who claim to be feeling
   very well and thankful. Emma is shocked, unable to understand such lies
   and all the strange environment "with too much air". Max goes with
   Lamia to a bedroom and tries to explain to her what mating is, while
   Albert tries his luck with Emma.

   Later, while resting in the living room, Max and Albert suddenly hear
   the familiar sound of an arriving elevator and hide. It is Her
   Excellency who emerges from the elevator (which is hidden within a
   closet) to feed her caged birds. When she opens the wardrobe, she is
   attacked by Max who was hiding inside. During the ensuing fight, Her
   Excellency's breasts and hair are stripped, revealing that 'she' is a
   male in disguise, much to 'her' panic and Max's disgust and rage. Max
   also removes an electronic necklace, which was converting 'Her'
   Excellency's voice into one that sounds like a woman's. 'Her'
   Excellency tells the men his life story - just after the war, when the
   League of Women took power, he was 4 years old; the few boys remaining
   were naturalized into girls, but he was hidden by his mother. Growing
   up in a female disguise, he joined the League and finally was elected
   'Her Excellency'. He was too afraid of women to form a relationship
   with any and, by revealing himself, to try to restore the old order.
   The government has been exaggerating the radiation level in order to
   keep the inhabitants underground, making them easier to control;
   likewise, the inhabitants are medicated to remove sexual desire. The
   three make a deal: Max and Albert will not compromise 'Her'
   Excellency's true identity, but they will stay in his home with Lamia
   and Emma. Later, Max and Albert, disguised as laboratory workers, add
   male gametes to flasks in the incubation centre. Flashing forward to
   several months later, a nurse, routinely wrapping newborns in blankets,
   is horrified to see a penis.
