   Starring a group of mostly unknown actors, This Is Not a Test begins
   with lone deputy sheriff Dan Colter (Seamon Glass) receiving orders
   to block a road leading into an unidentified city (dialogue indicates
   the location is somewhere in central California, however). Soon, he
   has detained several vehicles with a variety of occupants ranging from
   an elderly man and his granddaughter, to a man who has recently become
   rich and his alcoholic wife, to a trucker and a hitchhiker. The
   motorists and the police officer hear attack warnings over the police
   radio and begin to prepare for the inevitable bombing. The film focuses
   on the reactions to the impending attack by the motorists, and the
   officer's efforts to keep order. Complicating matters is the
   revelation that the hitchhiker Clint Delany (Ron Starr) is a psychotic
   who is wanted for murder. As the countdown to the missile attack
   continues, the men and women try desperately to convert a supply truck
   into an impromptu bomb shelter. As time goes by, the deputy's
   behavior becomes irrational and the film ends with the deputy trying to
   enter the closed-up truck where the others have sheltered just as the
   nuclear strike happens. What condition the survivors find when they
   exit the shelter is not disclosed.
