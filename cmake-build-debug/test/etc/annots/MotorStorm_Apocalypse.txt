   Apocalypse is more story-driven than previous instalments. The events
   of Apocalypse's MotorStorm Festival are told from the perspective of
   three participants, labelled Mash "The Rookie", Tyler "The Pro", and
   Big Dog "The Veteran" by Evolution Studios, with each participant also
   representing a difficulty level of gameplay. These three
   participants will each see different parts of the catastrophe unfold
   over the course of the three-day festival.
