   The story is written in an epistolary form with the narrator recounting
   the events that had occurred in a letter. The letter is dated 17 June
   1816. The narrator embarks on a journey or "Grand Tour" to the East
   with an elderly man, Augustus Darvell. During the journey, Darvell
   becomes physically weaker, "daily more enfeebled". They both arrive at
   a Turkish cemetery between Smyrna and Ephesus near the columns of
   Diana. Near death, Darvell reaches a pact with the narrator not to
   reveal his impending death to anyone. A stork appears in the cemetery
   with a snake in its mouth. After Darvell dies, the narrator is shocked
   to see that his face turns black and his body rapidly decomposes:

   "I was shocked with the sudden certainty which could not be mistaken --
   his countenance in a few minutes became nearly black. I should have
   attributed so rapid a change to poison, had I not been aware that he
   had no opportunity of receiving it unperceived."

   Darvell is buried in the Turkish cemetery by the narrator. The
   narrator's reaction was stoical: "I was tearless." According to John
   Polidori, Byron intended to have Darvell reappear, alive again, as a
   vampire, but did not finish the story. Polidori's account of Byron's
   story in a letter to his publisher in 1819 indicates it "depended for
   interest upon the circumstances of two friends leaving England, and one
   dying in Greece, the other finding him alive upon his return, and
   making love to his sister."
