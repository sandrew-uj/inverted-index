   For twenty years, Atrix Wolfe has turned his back on his magic to live
   with the wolves in the mountains. A powerful mage, twenty years ago
   Atrix Wolfe turned the King of the Wood into a terrible Hunter in order
   to force the invading Kardeth army, which threatened the kingdoms of
   Pelucir and Chaumenard, to retreat. The Hunter massacred not only the
   invaders, but the Pelucir forces as well, including the king. During
   the creation of the Hunter, the daughter of the King and Queen of the
   Wood, Saro (pronounced the same as "sorrow", a term which is a
   recurring motif of the book), disappeared.

   Talis, the prince of Pelucir, is attending mage's school at Chaumenard
   when he discovers a book by an unknown author. Though it is only a
   beginner's spellbook, he is strangely fascinated by it and takes it
   with him when his brother Burne, the king, summons him back to Pelucir.
   Experimenting with the book, he discovers that none of the spells do
   what they say, and are actually codes for more dangerous spells. He
   takes his studies with the book into the keep which the Kardeth army
   besieged in the incident 20 years before, and which has been haunted
   and abandoned ever since. In the kitchens of the castle, a scullery
   maid named Saro is mute, and thus interacts more with the pots and pans
   than other people. She is tasked with bringing Talis's meals to the
   keep, since her lack of knowledge of the world outside the kitchen
   makes her the only one not afraid of the keep's ghosts. When he meets
   Saro, he notices that her facial features seem to constantly shift,
   preventing her from being recognized. This is the first time Saro has
   had someone actually look at her, rather than seeing her only for her
   occupation.

   Warned by a dream, Atrix Wolfe attempts to retrieve a spellbook he
   wrote shortly after the incident 20 years ago, but finds it has moved
   from where he hid it. He discovers Talis took it back to Pelucir, and
   arrives at the keep just in time to save Talis from the Hunter. While
   Talis is fleeing from the Hunter, the Queen of the Wood takes him into
   the magical world of the wood. She says she will only allow him to
   return to the human world if he brings her Atrix Wolfe, who she needs
   to find Saro. She cannot get Atrix herself because neither he nor she
   can pass through the barrier between the human world and the world of
   the wood. Talis brings her Atrix Wolfe, who agrees to find Saro, and
   the Queen returns Talis to his world.

   Having become enamored of the Queen of the Wood, Talis resolves to find
   Saro for her before Atrix Wolfe. Though Talis has never been properly
   introduced to her, he intuits that the scullery maid is Saro, her
   muteness and ever-changing face being a spell which has kept the Queen
   from finding her. He brings her to the Queen. The Hunter finds them all
   there and shoots an arrow into Talis. The threat to his life ignites
   Saro into breaking the spell upon herself, remembering who she is and
   crying out to her father, ending her muteness. This in turn bring Ilyos
   back to himself.

   Ilyos, however, has been through so much that he cannot return to his
   life as the Queen's consort. In order to protect the Queen's world, he
   has Atrix Wolfe turn him into one of the trees of the Wood. As partial
   penance for having caused the death of Burne and Talis's father, Atrix
   Wolfe remains in Pelucir to tutor Talis in magic. Talis is surprised
   when Saro returns to Pelucir, and they begin to become acquainted. She
   says that she no longer felt at home in the world of the Wood, and that
   he is the only one who can understand her, being the only other person
   to have spent time in both worlds.
