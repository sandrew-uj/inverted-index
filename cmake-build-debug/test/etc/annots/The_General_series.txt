   The first five books are set on the planet Bellevue, previously part of
   a high-technology galactic civilization (the Federation). Interstellar
   civilization collapsed during "The Fall", when extensive civil war
   greatly reduced the planet's technology level. Technology has
   redeveloped only slowly: the most advanced groups have reached the
   level of double-expansion steam engines, wrapped-brass-cartridges
   breech-loading rifles (Martini-Henry lock or very similar) and
   lever-action carbines, cast-steel breech-loading cannon, simple
   revolvers, etc. Progress is slow: the breech-loading rifle design has
   not changed for over two hundred years, and other groups still use
   flintlock or percussion cap weapons.

   The concept of computer technology has become the basis of religion
   throughout the world, the Spirit of Man, with priestly Hierarchs,
   Sysups, and an Inquisition called the Anti-Viral Cleansers. This
   religion is split into two competing sects: The Spirit of Man of the
   Stars, the state religion of the Civil Government, and Spirit of Man of
   This Earth, which is more popular among the barbarian Military
   Governments. The people of Bellevue speak various evolved dialects,
   including Sponglish, Spanjol, Namerique and Paytoiz, with elements of
   English, French and Spanish apparent. At the time of the Fall the
   planet had no horses, so now cavalry is mounted on thousand-pound dogs
   of various breeds.

   The books begin in the Year of the Fall 1103, when the protagonist Raj
   Whitehall and his friend Thom Poplanich stumble on a still-working
   remnant of the old technology, the quantum supercomputer "Center",
   which Raj and Thom regard as an angel. Center describes itself as a
   "sentient artificial entity of photonic subsystems tasked with the
   politico-military supervision" of Bellevue. Center charges Whitehall
   with uniting Bellevue and provides him, through a constant mental link,
   with predictive visions that simulate probable situational outcomes,
   historical data, eidetic memory, and minor enhancements to physical
   abilities including accuracy with firearms. Raj couples these assets
   with his own charisma and skill to become an extremely effective
   military leader. Meanwhile, his wife Suzette quietly uses her own
   highly developed court intrigue skills to neutralize Raj's political
   foes and obstacles behind the scenes, compensating for his more direct
   tactics.

   Center keeps Thom in suspended animation within its sanctum, explaining
   that he will otherwise probably be the victim of political
   assassination before long, and begins to educate him in matters more
   related to civil administration. As Raj acknowledges (and Center's
   projections confirm), he would not be an effective civilian leader, but
   Thom--the legitimate heir, with the assistance of Raj and Center--will.

   True to their historical model, the campaigns of Belisarius, the books
   focus on the convoluted "strategic offensive, tactical defensive"
   campaigns of General Whitehall around the Midworld Sea and his fraught
   relationships with his paranoid but capable 'emperor' -- Governor
   Barholm Clerett--and Clerett's avaricious and corrupt chancellor
   Tzetzas.

   Whitehall's nation calls itself the Civil Government, and it is
   centrally located between the rival nations of the Military
   Governments--The Brigade and The Squadron--and the Muslim Colonists.
