   Nita Callahan, taking refuge in the library from bullies, checks out a
   book found in the children's section with the provocative title So You
   Want To Be a Wizard. On the way home, the bullies corner her, beat her
   up, and take a space pen given to her by her uncle. Before Nita goes to
   sleep, she takes the Wizard's Oath. The next morning she looks at her
   manual and sees her name in the wizards list.

   She goes to a quiet place to work a pen retrieval spell, and meets
   Christopher "Kit" Rodriguez, also a new wizard. Kit is making a spell
   intended to surround him with an aura of fearlessness. Combining their
   intentions, they create a new spell, which presents a vision of an
   alternate Manhattan: polluted, lightless, and frightening. A terrible
   being composed of pure desire reaches up to consume them, and to
   escape, they open their minds to the universe - which ends up bringing
   an intelligent white hole from space. Translated into English and
   simplified, the white hole's name is "Fred".

   The next day at school Fred and Nita attempt to retrieve Nita's pen
   from her bullies, but Fred miscalculates the gravity required to lift
   the pen from the bullies' possession, and instead accidentally swallows
   it. This makes Fred hiccup objects, including a television, a blue
   Mercedes, and a Learjet. After school, they seek help from the local
   Advisory Wizards. Fred's problem is fixed, but Nita's pen is not
   recovered. In order to retrieve it, they must link Fred to a worldgate
   in Grand Central Station and pull the pen out of Fred.

   Fred also has some alarming news: a crucial book has gone missing.
   Called the Naming of Lights, it is a compendium of information that
   describes the true nature of everything that has or will exist. It is
   also known as The Book of Night with Moon because it can only be read
   by moonlight. Its shadow, The Book Which is Not Named, contains
   descriptions that are twisted out of their true patterns. If the Lone
   Power - the being of desire and hate sensed by Nita and Kit - were to
   read the shadow Book without the bright Book being read, the cosmos
   would be irreparably skewed.

   In Grand Central, Nita and Kit find that the worldgate has been knocked
   out of place and is hovering above the station. Nita invokes the air to
   solidify into a walkway between the roof of the Pan Am Building and the
   gate, but before Nita can retrieve her pen, a pack of
   werewolf-analogues attack, causing Nita, Kit, and Fred to plunge
   through the worldgate.

   On the other side, Nita's pen is lying on the floor of a building in an
   alternate New York City. The landscape is cold, dark and lifeless,
   populated by predators. Many resemble automobiles, but there are also
   glowing-eyed dun mice, batlike skinwings, and dragonlike fireworms.
   This world belongs to the Lone Power, a thing far worse than any devil
   and more ancient than the earth.

   Nita, Kit, and Fred learn that the two Books are here, and that to get
   home they will have to read from the bright Book. To find the bright
   Book, they decide to steal the dark Book from the Lone Power, because
   they need the Bright Book's power to find the worldgate, which has been
   hidden in the darkness that the Lone Power has created. On their way to
   the Lone Power's office, Kit finds a racing car, a Lotus Esprit, beside
   its prey, a "dead" sedan, injured by a piece of metal lodged in its
   axle. Kit cuts this piece away, and the Lotus roars off, free.

   Inside the building, Nita, Kit, and Fred eavesdrop on the Lone Power's
   phone call to the Archangel Michael. Michael suspects his brother stole
   the bright Book, while the Lone Power suspects him of sending Nita and
   Kit to steal it back. Nita and Kit have not previously considered this,
   but it begins to make sense.
   Old City Hall subway platform

   Nita steals the dark Book, and uses it to locate the bright Book in the
   tunnels under City Hall. Aided by the Lotus Esprit, who has returned to
   show its gratitude, they proceed to the tunnels, where they discover
   the Book is guarded by the Eldest of the fireworms. The Eldest - a
   dragon-like fire-breathing lizard - lies on a vast hoard of stolen
   gold, gems, silver plate, plastic toys, coins, and bones. The wizards
   bargain with the Eldest, giving it the dark Book in exchange for the
   bright Book, in addition to securing the hoard with a magical barrier.

   The enraged Lone Power comes after them on the back of an eight-legged,
   skull-faced beast. They flee through the worldgate, and re-enter their
   homeworld with the Lone Power on their heels. To stop the Lone Power
   from destroying their Universe, Kit and Nita quickly enlist a wall of
   magically animated trees and statues around a refuge in Central Park,
   and begin to read from the bright Book by moonlight, to undo the
   changes that the Lone Power has been making during the pursuit.

   The Lone Power then puts out the Sun, extinguishing the moonlight that
   is necessary to read from the Book. Fred sacrifices himself by "blowing
   his quanta", releasing all his mass as energy in the form of visible
   light, which, reflected by the moon, becomes moonlight by which the
   Wizards can continue reading. As Kit and Nita recite the Lone Power's
   true name, written in the bright Book, Nita makes a slight modification
   to the text (the symbol ), giving the Lone Power the option to become a
   positive rather than a negative energy.

   Renamed and vanquished, the Lone Power withdraws. Nita and Kit go home,
   their Ordeal complete.
