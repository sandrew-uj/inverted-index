   Following Ash's death in the previous 'Army of Darkness' storyline The
   Death of Ash, and is now in (what appears to be) Heaven. The
   superpowered entity known as The Sentry shows up in the afterlife
   (having been sent there by the Watcher in Marvel Zombies Return) and
   begins consuming everyone in sight. Ash and the Sentry end up shunted
   into another reality (again by the Watcher according to Marvel Zombies
   Return). Along the way, Ash receives a prophecy warning him that "an
   army of the dead will rise" and that this world will fall.

   In this alternative version of the Marvel Universe known as Earth-2149,
   Ash encounters a fight between Daredevil and Thunderball. He mistakes
   Daredevil for the villain, and after letting Thunderball escape, tries
   to warn the Avengers of a Deadite invasion. They do not believe him,
   mostly due to his buffoonery while hitting on the female members of the
   team. Scarlet Witch teleports Ash away, as Jarvis tells the team of a
   disturbance.

   When Ash spots the now infected Avengers, he says he tried to warn
   them, and Spider-Man arrives and takes Ash off with a request from
   Colonel America. While Ash tells his side of the story to Spider-Man,
   Colonel America attacks and bites Spider-Man on the left shoulder, who
   seemingly drops Ash on the ground in front of some zombified Avengers.
   Realizing Ash is right and that his body is fighting the infection,
   Spider-Man bluffs and says he wants to eat Ash and carries him off,
   only to abandon him when he goes to check on his Aunt May and wife Mary
   Jane. (In the prequel comic Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, it is revealed
   that Spider-Man is eventually 'consumed' by the zombification disease
   and kills and devours his loved ones.)

   Ash then encounters the Punisher, who gives Ash a bag of spare weapons
   and shoots and presumably kills Kingpin, Hammerhead and the Owl. On the
   ground, Punisher kills Thunderball, who is fending off his zombified
   Wrecking Crew allies, who then turn on Punisher. Ash bumps into
   Dazzler, who takes him to Doctor Strange's headquarters.
   Simultaneously, this reality's version of Ash, who had decided to fight
   the zombies, joins Dazzler. This reality's Ash is killed by a zombie
   Howard the Duck, who is in turn killed by the main version of Ash and
   the Scarlet Witch.

   In Strange's mansion, Ash, Dazzler and the Scarlet Witch search for the
   Necronomicon, as Ash suspects that this is a Deadite invasion. Since
   there is no Necronomicon in the mansion, the trio travel to Latveria,
   the castle of Doctor Doom, which is under attack by an invasion force
   (from Dead Days, where Reed Richards turned his Fantastic Four into
   zombies upon deciding this infection is the most efficient form of
   life). Doom has Ash imprisoned with the other survivors for acting like
   an idiot. Ash then steals a Doombot's armor, disguises himself as Doom,
   and roams around Doomstadt.

   While wandering, Ash meets the Enchantress, held prisoner by Doom, and
   frees her. When he takes her to Scarlet Witch and Dazzler, Enchantress
   drops her illusion, revealing that she is a zombie, and bites off
   Dazzler's finger, whereupon Doom kills both women with an energy blast.
   The zombies break into the castle; Scarlet Witch is attacked and
   infected by the zombified Punisher, and Doom is bitten and infected by
   Reed Richards, but manages to escape and fight back the disease to aid
   his people's escape to an alternate universe.

   Ash locates this world's Necronomicon, but the talking book says that
   it cannot stop the zombie plague because the zombies are not Deadites.
   The book reveals that yes, an "army of the dead will rise" and yes, the
   world will fall, but that those two things don't necessarily have
   anything to do with each other, apart from happening around the same
   time. Ash threatens the Necronomicon, saying that when the human food
   supply is exhausted, the zombies will eat the book because it is bound
   in human flesh, and the Necronomicon decides to cooperate. On Ash's
   orders, it raises the zombie victims up as Deadites, distracting the
   zombies long enough for Doom to teleport Ash to a parallel world of his
   choosing and the survivors to a safe haven.

   The invading zombies attack Doom just as Ash escapes. The zombies, upon
   finding the Necronomicon, reveal to it that they would never eat a
   book, and the zombified Wolverine hands the book over to the Hulk for
   use as toilet paper. Going through multiple alternate worlds, Ash
   accidentally chooses an alternate Earth populated by Marvel superhero
   werewolves and is pursued yet again. Ash is revealed to have somehow
   escaped from this Earth and returned to his own Earth by the following
   'Army of Darkness' storyline: From The Ashes'.
