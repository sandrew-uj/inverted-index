   Camilla Haven has recently broken her engagement to Philip and is
   holidaying on her own in Greece. She is sitting in a cafe in Athens
   writing to Elizabeth, who would have been with Camilla but for a broken
   leg, when a man appears with a message about a hired car for Delphi.
   Camilla hasn't requested it, but no one else claims the car. She wants
   to visit Delphi, but was doubtful about being able to afford it. She's
   told that it is a matter of "life and death" and that the deposit has
   been paid. So, after leaving her hotel address with the cafe's
   proprietor, she drives the car to Delphi herself.

   On the way she meets Simon Lester. Simon, who had been a child during
   the war, is in Greece to learn more about the death of his brother
   Michael during the Second World War (some 15 years earlier). Simon had
   been in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) (precursor of the CIA)
   and had written a letter home hinting at a significant discovery. Some
   of the ruthless antagonists involved in theft, smuggling, and murder
   during the occupation of Greece in the war have now menacingly
   re-emerged on the scene. Camilla becomes involved in the increasingly
   complex and dangerous unraveling of the circumstances of Michael
   Lester's death, which now threaten Camilla and Simon.
