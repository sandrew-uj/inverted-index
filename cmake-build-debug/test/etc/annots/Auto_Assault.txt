   After years of widescale open war between three factions--Humans,
   mutants, and the human-created Biomeks--the issues between the groups
   are largely pacified on the worldwide scale, but conflict between the
   three remain with small scale battles involving armored cars, trucks,
   motorcycles, semis and tanks armed with advanced weaponry. This is the
   fictional, futuristic world the player starts and plays the game in.
