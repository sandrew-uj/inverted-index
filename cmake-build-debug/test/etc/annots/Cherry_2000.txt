   In the year 2017, the United States has fragmented into
   post-apocalyptic wastelands with a few civilized areas. An ongoing
   economic crisis has led to the recycling of aging 20th-century
   mechanical and technological equipment. Society has also become one
   that is averse to intimacy, as well as both increasingly
   hypersexualized and bureaucratic. Robotic technology has produced
   female androids (more properly, Gynoids) as substitutes for wives. The
   declining instances of actual sex among men and women is litigious,
   with one brothel having lawyers draft up contracts detailing the
   intended sexual rondevous.

   Business executive Sam Treadwell (David Andrews) owns a Cherry 2000
   model Gynoid as his wife. After she short circuits during sex on a wet
   kitchen floor, Sam is told by a repairman that she is damaged beyond
   repair, though her rare and valuable memory disk, which contains her
   entire personality, can be used in a new body if the same model can be
   found. A Gynoid dealer tells Sam that the Cherry 2000 model is no
   longer produced and that the only remaining ones are in a defunct
   warehouse in "Zone 7," a particularly dangerous, lawless area. With
   Cherry's memory disk stored in a device that plays back Cherry's voice,
   Treadwell hires Edith "E" Johnson (Melanie Griffith), a tough tracker,
   to guide him to the factory. They set off in Edith's heavily modified
   1965 Ford Mustang.

   Entering Zone 7, they encounter Lester (Tim Thomerson), a wasteland
   overlord with deranged subordinates. Edith and Sam take refuge in an
   underground reservoir occupied by Six-Fingered Jake (Ben Johnson), an
   elderly tracker who was Edith's mentor. When Lester's men attack, the
   three attempt to escape, but Treadwell is knocked unconscious and taken
   to a 1950s-styled motel/village. Ginger (Cameron Milzer), one of
   Lester's gang, reveals herself as Treadwell's ex-girlfriend, previously
   known as Elaine. Lester decides to induct Treadwell into the group, and
   Treadwell, believing that Edith and Jake are dead, goes along for a
   while. When he witnesses the group sadistically murdering a tracker,
   Treadwell decides to escape and runs into Edith and Jake, still quite
   alive. Jake, who had earlier led Treadwell to believe that the Cherry
   2000 memory disk had been lost, still has it and gives it to Edith
   while he stays behind to draw off Lester's gang.

   Treadwell, a veteran of earlier wars, shows that he is a capable
   fighter, and Edith begins to have feelings for him. Treadwell's own
   growing feelings toward Edith, though, are derailed when he hears
   Cherry's voice accidentally play on the audio device. Continuing to
   work their way to the Gynoid warehouse, they arrive at a brothel/gas
   station owned by Snappy Tom (Harry Carey, Jr.), a friend of Jake's,
   where a dilapidated Aeronca Champion light airplane is stored. Edith
   repairs the plane using parts from the Mustang. Jake catches up with
   the group and reminisces with Snappy Tom, but Snappy's live-in
   girlfriend (Jennnifer Mayo) betrays their location to Lester over the
   radio and shoots Jake in the back. Edith and Treadwell manage to escape
   in the plane.

   Treadwell is almost ready to abandon the quest, but Edith is determined
   to complete her job as a tracker so Jake's death will not become
   meaningless. As they land, Zone 7 is revealed to be actually the
   abandoned ruins of Las Vegas and the Gynoid "warehouse" is actually a
   casino. Treadwell finally finds a functional Cherry 2000 model (Pamela
   Gidley) and activates her with the memory disk; however, being
   programmed only for home life and sex, the robot is incapable of
   adapting to the current dangerous situation when Lester and his gang
   attack.

   In an extended battle, Treadwell, Edith, and Cherry climb aboard the
   airplane, but their combined weight prevents takeoff. Edith jumps out
   so that Treadwell and the robot can escape, but Treadwell realizes that
   Cherry cannot provide the human interaction that he and Edith have had
   and turns the plane around. Cherry, programmed to fulfill Treadwell's
   wishes, offers to bring him a Pepsi, so he sends her away as he and
   Edith fight off Lester's gang and take off in the plane. When Lester
   tries to lasso the plane, he gets caught in the rope and hangs himself
   from one of the ancient Las Vegas neon casino signs. Edith and Sam kiss
   as they fly away into the sunset.
