   Platonic archetypes begin to manifest themselves outside a small
   Hertfordshire town, wreaking havoc and drawing to the surface the
   spiritual strengths and flaws of individual characters. Their focus is
   the home of Mr Berringer, the leader of a group interested in magical
   symbolism who falls into a coma after contact with the first archetype
   unloosed, the lion of the title. Other powers follow this one and cut
   off the town from the rest of the world that they will inevitably
   absorb and reshape. Among those overcome and destroyed by the raw
   powers they encounter are two members of the group, Mr Foster and Miss
   Wilmot, whose motivation is ultimately selfish. A chance visitor to the
   group, the academic author Damaris Tighe, narrowly escapes the same
   fate but is saved at the last moment by her cousin and fiance, Anthony
   Durrant. She then sets out to locate Anthony's friend, Quentin Sabot,
   who had been with Anthony when the lion first appeared and has now fled
   into the countryside, overcome with terror.

   Meanwhile, with the help of another group member, Mr Richardson, who
   also has the inner strength to withstand the angelical archetypes,
   Anthony is enabled to understand the process that has been unleashed by
   Berringer. Together they plan to counter it and reverse the threat. Its
   next phase has already started and some of the town's buildings begin
   to collapse as Berringer's house is swallowed in a column of
   unquenchable flame. Armed with the secret names of the archetypes from
   a grimoire, Anthony summons them back to their point of focus while
   Richardson neutralizes the fire by walking into it.
