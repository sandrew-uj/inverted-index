   A virus has laid waste to civilization, turning the infected into
   flesh-eating and mortally contagious zombies. But events have
   stabilized, and the rebuilding process has begun. Over a three-day
   span, "Mark Spitz" and his fellow "sweepers"--other survivors of the
   apocalypse--patrol portions of New York City, eliminating zombies as
   part of a mission to make the city habitable once again. Flashbacks
   pepper the narrative, explaining how "Mark Spitz" survived the
   apocalypse to date and got his nickname along the way.
