   The werlings of Hagwood (small creatures with the ability to transform
   into animals) live peacefully in the trees of the forest, overlooked
   and unbothered while they leisurely perfect the art of wergling
   (shape-changing). But unlike his fellow werlings, the bumbling Gamaliel
   Tumpin can't manage to wergle into even the simplest of forms (a mouse)
   like his peers. He's tormented by his sister, Kernella, and teased by
   his classmates. And he envies star student Finnen Lufkin, who can
   transform into almost any creature. But wergling will soon be the least
   of Gamaliel's troubles. The evil elf queen Rhiannon, the High Lady of
   the Hollow Hill, is desperately seeking a precious possession that was
   stolen long ago. Her evil knows no bounds, and with her army of
   monstrous thorn ogres, she will not stop until it's found. The
   werlings' peaceful existence is threatened by death and danger, and
   clumsy, awkward Gamaliel will need to call on the strength within him
   to fight for his family and his home.^[2]
