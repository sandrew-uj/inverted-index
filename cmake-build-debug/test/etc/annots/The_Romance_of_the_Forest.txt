   Monsieur Pierre de la Motte and his wife, Madame Constance de la Motte,
   are fleeing Paris in an attempt to escape his creditors. Pierre,
   Madame, and their two domestic servants, Peter and Annette, are waylaid
   when the path they're on becomes too dark to follow any longer. Pierre
   exits the carriage and continues on foot toward a light he notices some
   distance away from the carriage. Upon knocking on the door of a small
   and ancient house, Pierre is admitted into the house by a stranger. He
   is given a bed and promptly locked in the room. Sometime later, the
   door to Pierre's room is unlocked and a beautiful young lady, Adeline,
   is being dragged behind the stranger who admitted Pierre to the house.
   The stranger states that "if you wish to save your life, swear that you
   will convey this girl where I may never see her more; or rather consent
   to take her with you". Upon agreement to take Adeline with him,
   Pierre and Adeline are conveyed to the carriage by the ruffian stranger
   with Madame still inside.

   The family, with the addition of Adeline, proceeds into the darkened
   interior of a forest, hoping to elude discovery and heeding the
   warnings of the stranger to not come back on the land they just left.
   Eventually, they find refuge in a ruined abbey after their wagon wheel
   breaks. Initially, everyone in the group except Peter is afraid of what
   lies in waiting behind the abbey walls; however, closer inspection by
   Peter shows the only inhabitants are mice, owls, bats, and the like.
   Still afraid of being pursued by creditors, the family and Adeline stay
   close to the abbey. Peter is sent into the town of Auboine for supplies
   to fix their broken wagon wheel. After returning to the family, Peter
   confides to Pierre that while he was in town he got in a fight and was
   unable to procure the necessary supplies for fixing the wheel, but he
   did purchase some food to tide them over.

   The family and the servants settle into the rooms of the abbey, making
   each one more inhabitable the longer they stay. After some time passes,
   while in town, Peter comes across a gentleman who inquires about the La
   Motte family. Thinking the people inquiring about the La Motte family
   are creditors, the family, Adeline, and the servants all go into hiding
   through the trap door Pierre has found in one of the bedrooms. They
   spend the night in the dark and terrifying rooms, where unbeknownst to
   everyone else, Pierre discovers a skeleton in a chest. The next day,
   everyone agrees to send Adeline out to check if anyone is at the abbey
   since she is the only one who would be unrecognisable to creditors.
   Upon greeting one of her woodland animal friends, a young male stranger
   approaches her. Soon Adeline discovers that this stranger is actually
   Pierre and Madame's son, Louis. They left Paris without giving notice
   to his regiment, and he had come searching for his parents. Soon after,
   Madame confides to Louis her jealous fears that Adeline seeks to have
   an affair with her husband. Louis is supposed to find out the truth of
   where Pierre has been spending his days, but is unable to do so after
   losing sight of his father in the dense forest. Madame stays hostile to
   Adeline, believing the worst of her in relation to her supposed affair
   with Pierre. At the same time, Louis has fallen in love with Adeline
   and pines for her saying "I should esteem myself most happy, if I could
   be of service to you."

   Meanwhile, "Louis, by numberless little attentions, testified his
   growing affection for Adeline, who continued to treat them as passing
   civilities. It happened, one stormy night, as they were preparing for
   rest, that they were alarmed by a trampling of horses near the
   abbey". The riders introduce themselves as the Marquis de Montalt,
   who is the owner of the abbey, and his attendants, one of which is
   named Theodore. Pierre becomes more distressed after the appearance of
   the Marquis. Louis notes this distress, but must soon leave to return
   to his regiment. During this time, Theodore attempts to warn Adeline
   that he fears she has been deceived and danger is upon her. Before he
   can formally speak with Adeline, he is sent to return to his regiment
   as well.

   Pierre and the Marquis, at this same time, have been speaking in
   private to one another. After Theodore's departure, Adeline fears her
   father will return for her when overhearing a conversation between
   Pierre and the Marquis. She relates her fears to Pierre, and he allows
   her to believe that is what the conversation's subject consisted of.
   Throughout this time period, as well, Adeline also finds a manuscript
   written by someone who had been held captive inside the abbey during
   1642. The writer of the manuscript relates his dire circumstances and
   impending death at the hands of an unknown perpetrator. Adeline notes
   when reading the manuscript that it "is in a barely legible and
   fragmented condition. It suggests much more than it can say".
   Adeline ultimately informs Pierre of the manuscript once she reaches
   particularly terrifying point while reading it.

   Adeline is then warned of danger again, but this time Peter is the
   person who warns her. He attempts several times to tell her the issue
   at hand, until finally he is able to relate his findings. Adeline finds
   out the reality of the conversations between the Marquis and Pierre:
   The Marquis wants to make Adeline his wife and was discussing the
   matter with Pierre. However, Adeline discovers through Peter that the
   Marquis actually already has a wife and she would have really had a
   "fake marriage" and became the Marquis' mistress. At no point, however,
   is Adeline inclined to become either the Marquis' wife or mistress.
   Peter and Adeline concoct a plan to help her escape the abbey and a
   potentially reputation ruining situation. Unfortunately, when making
   her escape, Adeline is tricked, and instead she is taken to the
   Marquis' residence. Adeline soon attempts to escape the Marquis by
   climbing out the window where she runs into Theodore, who is there to
   rescue her. The two leave in a carriage and the Marquis quickly follows
   once he realises what has happened.

   Adeline and Theodore stop at an inn where the Marquis finds them.
   Theodore, who initially is ailing but eventually recovers, wounds the
   Marquis. Now instead of him being in trouble for just deserting his
   regiment, he also must face the consequences for wounding a superior
   officer. Prior to all of this commotion, Adeline realises she is in
   love with Theodore while he is sick. Theodore is imprisoned, and
   Adeline is returned to Pierre de la Motte at the abbey. The Marquis
   informs Pierre that he wants to kill Adeline, not marry her, now.
   Pierre finds that he is "entangled in the web which his own crimes had
   woven. Being in the power of the Marquis, he knew he must either
   consent to the commission of a deed, from the enormity of which,
   depraved as he was, he shrunk in horror; or sacrifice fortune, freedom,
   probably life itself, to the refusal". Pierre finds he is unable to
   allow Adeline to be killed, thus he sends Adeline with Peter on
   horseback to Peter's sister's house in Leloncourt.

   When Peter and Adeline finally reach Leloncourt, Adeline is taken ill
   and is nursed to health first by Peter's sister and later by Clara la
   Luc. Here, "Adeline, who had long been struggling with fatigue and
   indisposition, now yielded to their pressure... But, notwithstanding
   her fatigue, she could not sleep, and her mind, in spite of all her
   efforts, returned to the scenes that were passed, or presented gloomy
   and imperfect visions of the future". After her illness, Adeline is
   essentially adopted by Arnaud la Luc, Clara's father, and spends the
   remainder of her time with the family. Clara also has a brother, but he
   currently is not present. Yet, soon Monsieur la Luc's health is failing
   (he is taken with consumption), and the family must relocate to a
   different climate for a time. Eventually, Louis de la Motte finds
   Adeline and brings her news of Theodore. He informs her that he is
   imprisoned and his death is imminent because of the assault he made on
   his general officer. Here, Monsieur la Luc finds out that the Theodore
   in reference is actually his son that he has not seen for many years.

   Meanwhile, Monsieur and Madame de la Motte are facing their own
   troubles. Pierre de la Motte is placed on trial for a robbery he
   previously committed against the Marquis before he knew who the Marquis
   was. The Marquis would not have pressed any charges had Pierre assisted
   the murder of Adeline. Presently, however, Monsieur and Madame de la
   Motte are in Paris. Pierre is imprisoned and Madame is with him.

   Unaware of this, Adeline, Clara, and Monsieur la Luc travel to Paris to
   be with Theodore prior to his execution. While Pierre is on trial,
   witnesses come forward, and it is discovered that the Marquis is not
   who he claims to be; he had previously murdered Adeline's father, and
   stole his inheritance. Because of these recent developments, Theodore
   is released from his imprisonment while the Marquis poisons himself,
   but not before he confesses all his wrongdoings. "It appeared that
   convinced he had nothing to hope from his trial, he had taken this
   method of avoiding an ignominious death. In the last hours of his life,
   while tortured with the remembrance of his crime, he resolved to make
   all the atonement that remained for him, and having swallowed the
   potion, he immediately sent for a confessor to take a full confession
   of his guilt, and two notaries, and thus established Adeline beyond
   dispute in the rights of her birth, also bequeathing her a considerable
   legacy".
