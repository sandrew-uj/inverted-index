   According to an old legend, when the end of the world comes, a place
   known as Paradise will appear. However, only wolves will know how to
   find it. Although wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction
   nearly two hundred years ago, they still exist, surviving by casting
   illusions over themselves to make them appear human. Freeze City is
   a northern human city in a world where the majority of people live in
   poverty and hardship.

   Kiba, an injured lone white wolf, goes to Freeze City following the
   scent of the Lunar Flower, which is the key to opening Paradise. There
   he encounters Tsume, Hige and Toboe, three other wolves who were drawn
   to Freeze City by the scent of the Lunar Flower and are now living in
   the city. The wolves encounter Quent Yaiden, a former Sheriff of Kyrios
   who is obsessed with hunting down wolves, and his dog Blue. Cheza, the
   Flower Maiden who is destined to lead the wolves to Paradise, is being
   studied at a laboratory under the care of Cher Degre. She is awakened
   by the smell of wolf's blood. As Kiba and Hige approach the lab to find
   her, she is stolen away by Lord Darcia the Third, whose people created
   Cheza.

   With the Flower Maiden gone, the wolves have no reason to stay in the
   city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to
   stay together and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and
   Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various
   cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city's
   army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher's ex-husband Hubb Lebowski
   searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless
   pursuit of the wolves. When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it
   awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and
   take on her own human form. She joins the wolves and travels with them
   for a while, developing an intense and close romantic relationship with
   Hige, and meanwhile Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now
   searching for Blue as well as the wolves. Hubb eventually finds Cher
   and from there they continue their pursuit of the wolves to find Cheza.

   Together the wolves reach Darcia's keep after Kiba goes off on his own.
   Hubb, Cher and Quent arrive in the keep, and Tsume, Toboe, and Hige
   find Kiba, Cheza and Darcia during a sword fight between Darcia and
   Kiba. The reunion is short-lived however because Jaguara's troops
   attack, destroying the keep in the process. The Noble's troops capture
   Cheza, Hubb, Cher and Blue during the raid, and the wolves get
   separated from Kiba. After finding Kiba, the wolves continue their
   journey to rescue Cheza from Jaguara, while Cher rescues Blue and
   manages to find Cheza with help from Hubb, but Jaguara's troops
   instantly recapture Cheza, taking Hubb with them and forcing Cher and
   Blue to find Cheza on their own.

   The wolves and the humans eventually come together in Jaguara's city,
   where the captured Cheza is being held. In attempting to rescue the
   abducted Cheza, Kiba, Tsume and Toboe are captured. Tsume and Toboe are
   thrown into a dungeon with Hubb while Jaguara attempts to use Kiba's
   blood to force Paradise to open. Meanwhile, Hige and Blue are reunited
   outside the Keep, where Hige remembers that he had once worked for
   Jaguara and decides to go rescue his friends, but not before telling
   Blue to stay outside and promising her that he will return to her no
   matter what. While waiting for Hige, Blue is reunited with her master
   Quent and meanwhile Darcia, having survived the attack on his keep,
   interrupts Jaguara's ceremony as Kiba and the other wolves break free
   and rush to free the Flower Maiden. Hige is wounded during the fight
   against Jaguara and Kiba arrives after Darcia is poisoned by the Noble.
   Darcia battles Jaguara along with Kiba and finally slays her as the
   keep begins to collapse, ending the anime's original 26-episode run.

   As the original video animation (OVA) episodes begin, the wolves and
   the humans escape Jaguara's city, which has fallen into chaos. Quent is
   gravely wounded saving Blue from an oncoming vehicle, but he and Blue
   are found by Hubb and Cher, and subsequently by the wolves and Cheza.
   Together, they all continue making their way to Paradise, pursued by
   the now insane Darcia. As the Earth begins to fall into destruction,
   Cher dies when the car falls off a cliff. And soon after, Toboe is
   accidentally shot by Quent when he tries to shoot Darcia who in turn
   kills Quent. Hubb tries to keep up with the remaining wolves climbing
   up a mountain, but falls to his death. Darcia attacks the remaining
   wolves killing Hige, Blue, and Tsume, leaving only Kiba, Cheza and
   Darcia alive at the place where Paradise can be opened. Darcia and Kiba
   battle over who will open Paradise, in which Kiba is fatally wounded.
   Darcia dies when he attempts to enter Paradise due to not being a true
   wolf. Kiba finds Cheza as she dies and disintegrates into seeds. Dying,
   Kiba concludes that his quest has failed, but rain begins to fall and
   Cheza's seeds grow into thousands of lunar flowers. As he dies, Kiba
   falls into the water's depths but sees the blood red moon turning back
   to its normal color. Cheza's death causes Paradise, as well as the
   world, to be reborn. However, Darcia's corruption can be seen taking
   root in this new Paradise. The final scenes take place in what appears
   to be a 21st-century Japanese city. Kiba, apparently reincarnated as a
   human, passes other humans who resemble Tsume, Hige and Toboe; a lunar
   flower is seen blooming in an alleyway.
