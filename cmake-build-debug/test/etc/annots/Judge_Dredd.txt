   Main article: Judge Dredd (character) S: Setting

   Dredd's first stories take place in the year 2099, 122 years after its
   publication date in 1977. His regular stories are generally set 122
   years after their real-world publication date (unless otherwise stated
   as a flashback or prequel story), so that stories published in 2021 are
   set in 2143.

   The setting of Judge Dredd is a dystopian future Earth damaged by a
   series of international conflicts; much of the planet has become
   radioactive wasteland, and so populations have aggregated in enormous
   conurbations known as 'mega-cities'. The story is centred on the
   megalopolis of Mega-City One, on the east coast of North America.
   Within Mega-City One, extensive automation (including intelligent
   robots) has rendered the majority of the population unemployed. As
   a consequence, the general population is prone to embracing any fashion
   or craze they encounter. Mega-City One is surrounded by the
   inhospitable "Cursed Earth", a radioactive desert populated by
   outlaws and mutants. Much of the remaining world's geography is
   somewhat vague, although other mega-cities are visited in the strip.

   Mega-City One's population lives in gigantic towers known as City
   Blocks, each holding some 50,000 people. Each is named after some
   historical person or TV character, usually for comic effect. Mega-City
   One extends from Boston to Charlotte; but extended into Florida before
   the Apocalypse War laid waste to the southern sectors. At its
   height, the city contained a population of about 800 million; after the
   Apocalypse War, it was halved to 400 million.
