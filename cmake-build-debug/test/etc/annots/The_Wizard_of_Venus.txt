     * "The Wizard of Venus". Carson Napier is trapped in the castle of an
       insane Venusian "wizard" who holds the local population in thrall
       through the use of hypnotic powers. Napier, who is possessed of
       comparable powers he has hitherto utilized solely to transmit his
       account of his Venusian adventures back to Earth, successfully
       counters the tyrant and frees his victims.

     * "Pirate Blood". Johnny LaFitte of Glenora, California, a
       20th-century descendant of the New Orleans pirate Jean Lafitte,
       finds himself thrown by a bizarre set of events into his ancestor's
       profession. The author's depiction of modern-day piracy is replete
       with cold-blooded murder and rapine, but overall the tale is a
       semi-serious takeoff on the theory that heredity equals
       destiny.^[1]
