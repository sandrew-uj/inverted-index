   The novel is set in the far future, with humans on many worlds. Some
   have god-like powers, or perhaps are gods--the names and aspects of
   various Egyptian gods are used. Elements of horror and technology are
   mixed, and it has points in common with cyberpunk.

   Creatures of Light and Darkness was originally conceived and written as
   nothing more than a writing exercise in perspective by Roger
   Zelazny.^[1] He wrote it in present tense, constructed an entire
   chapter in poetry, and made the concluding chapter into the script of a
   play. He never intended it to be published, but when Samuel R. Delany
   heard about it from Zelazny, Delany convinced a Doubleday editor to
   demand that Zelazny give him the manuscript.^[2] Consequently, Zelazny
   dedicated the novel to Delany.

   Unlike other books by Zelazny, such as Lord of Light or the series The
   Chronicles of Amber, this novel is more poetic in style, and contains
   less straightforward action. However, like other novels, Zelazny
   incorporates ancient myth, in this case from Egyptian and some Greek
   myth, and weaves ultra-futuristic technology with fantasy elements.
