   In the year 1999, the world has been reduced to an apocalyptic
   wasteland due to an inexplicable gust of wind that wiped even the most
   basic memories, such as speech and civility, from the minds of the
   world's populace. Wataru befriends a young man named Johnny who, prior
   to the incident, was part of a government experiment designed to expand
   the memory capacity of the human mind and, therefore, was able to
   retain his memories. Johnny helps Wataru regain his speech and teaches
   him other basic functions. However, as a result of the physical toll
   his body endured due to the government experiments, Johnny dies after
   encouraging Wataru to travel the world.

   Wataru encounters a strange woman named Sophia after she helps him
   escape from an encounter with an unmanned Police Mech Unit and agrees
   to take Sophia to New York City. Together the two travel to Los Angeles
   where they help save Sue and her father, Little John, from a mob. Sue
   was to be offered as a bride to appease a "god", which in reality is a
   Construction Mech controlled by a man, but fled to escape her fate.
   However, upon realizing that if she were not sacrificed another woman
   would be in her stead, she flees from the group to rejoin her tribe.
   Wataru destroys the Construction Mech but Sue is killed in the
   conflict. Little John remains in Los Angeles to keep order of the tribe
   and rebuild society.

   Wataru and Sophia resume their travels only to be attacked once more by
   the Police Mech. Sophia rescues Wataru and brings him to an advanced
   city called Eternal Town for medical attention. When Wataru regains
   consciousness, he discovers that the city is run by a super computer
   that has brainwashed two of its original citizens into running the
   day-to-day operations of the city. The super computer attempts to
   persuade Sophia and Wataru into becoming citizens as well but the two
   escape with one of the original citizens, Lisa. As they depart from the
   city, Lisa begins to recall memories from her past including the fact
   that the other citizen who was brainwashed into running the city was
   her father. As a result, Lisa decides to remain in Eternal Town. Sophia
   then explains that she is a member of an alien race that is responsible
   for the wind that erased Earth's citizens' memories. Sophia makes a
   wager with Wataru that if he is able to convince another person to join
   him in his travels, she will return humanity's memory.

   Wataru and Sophia are chased across the country by the unrelenting
   Police Mech until they reach New York City. Upon arriving, Wataru drops
   Sophia off in order to defeat the Police Mech by himself. After
   destroying the Police Mech, Sophia saves Wataru as he falls from a
   building, and later the two kiss and have sex. Sophia leaves in order
   to rejoin her race and convince them that humanity deserves to have
   their memories.
