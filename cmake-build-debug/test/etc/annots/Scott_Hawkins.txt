   Carolyn had lived with eleven "siblings" under the care of a
   millennia-old and godlike man known to them as Father (also known as
   Ablakha or Adam Black), prone to acts of sadistic cruelty. All have
   strange powers, learned from books held in Father's library. Carolyn
   employs Steve Hodgson, a goodhearted former minor league housebreaker
   to break into a house for her. Unknown to him, she wanted to conceal
   evidence of a murder committed by her. Hodgson dies, betrayed by
   Carolyn.

   A metaphysical security device from Earth's future prevents them from
   entering the library. We learn more about the "siblings". David has
   inhuman martial skills. Jennifer had healing skills and can resurrect
   the dead. Michael speaks with animals and Carolyn herself knows many
   languages, many of them supernatural. Father has vanished, perhaps
   killed by one of his enemies.

   Erving Leffingham, a former war hero employed by the US government, has
   come to prison to interview Steve Hodgson (now alive once more). Steve
   had gone to jail for the murder Carolyn committed. David frees Steve,
   with many casualties. Carolyn phones the US President in order to drop
   all charges against Steve and sends the man himself to retrieve the
   mystical barrier. He'll have assistance of the lions Dresden and his
   female cub Naga, now allies of the family.

   After many misadventures, and the death of Dresden, Steve retrieves the
   artifacts. The US government, on the President's orders, attack the
   family and kill most of them. The sun goes out. Other apocalyptic
   events occur. Carolyn, who had killed Father, fights David. Thanks in
   part to the intervention of Erving (which Carolyn had planned), she
   bests him.

   Carolyn and Steve, it transpires, had known each other as children.
   Father had also planned for Carolyn to depose him. David, in between
   life and death, and in agony, serves as Earth's new, dark sun, but
   Steve voluntarily replaces him. Carolyn, with the assistance of Michael
   and Erving, will protect the Earth from Father's inhuman foes.
