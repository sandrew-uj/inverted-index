   The story is set in 1964 in and around Los Angeles, California. Jim
   Hastings is a young boy who lives with his uncle, Edward St. Ives;
   Jim's father suffered a nervous breakdown upon his wife's death and has
   been institutionalized ever since. Jim is increasingly puzzled by a
   series of strange events that seem to happen around his friend Giles
   "Gill" Peach who, like his father and forefathers before him, has
   gills. The boys are fascinated by pulp science fiction, and Gill begins
   building a device inspired by the "subterranean prospector" described
   in Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel At the Earth's Core.

   Jim's father William, who periodically escapes the psychiatric facility
   run by Hilario Frosticos, is convinced that Gill is being manipulated
   by unscrupulous adventurers allied with Frosticos: a hollow earth
   conspiracy. This is discounted as paranoia by St. Ives, Russell
   Latzarel, Roycroft Squires, and William Ashbless, all members of the
   Newtonian Society, an alternative science-oriented social club.
   However, as events unfold it appears that William's worst fears have a
   bizarre truth behind them, and the ideas described in Gill's diaries
   are more than weird tales.

   Clues found by William lead St. Ives and Latzarel to sewers connected
   to an underground river, mermen, bizarre technology, and a longevity
   serum based on carp. Together with Jim, the four men try to outmaneuver
   Frosticos in the race to reach a not-quite unimaginable goal.
