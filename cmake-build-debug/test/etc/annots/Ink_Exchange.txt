   The prologue of Ink Exchange revisits a scene from Wicked Lovely
   narrated by Irial, King of the Dark Court, in which he walks into a
   tattoo shop with Leslie, a 17-year-old human. The novel then follows
   Leslie as she prepares for a normal day of school. Leslie's alcoholic
   father and Ren, her drug-dealing brother, neglect her. Having once been
   drugged and raped by Ren's customers to cover one of his debts, Leslie
   fears her family, yet still pays the bills by working as a waitress.
   When Leslie reaches school, she is suspicious of how well Aislinn, the
   protagonist from Wicked Lovely, has adjusted to her new life as a
   faery. Aislinn, though once human, is the Summer Queen in the world of
   the fey, a world which she tries desperately to keep from Leslie.

   The novel then begins to follow Irial. It is revealed that the Dark
   Court feeds off emotions such as anger, hate, lust and pain to stay
   strong. When one of his own is killed by a simple human bullet, Irial
   is desperate for a way to protect his kind. With the help of his "left
   hand" Gabriel and his pack of "Hounds," he keeps his own and other
   courts in check. When confronted with numerous rebellions, Irial
   decides to pursue an ink exchange with a mortal to provide a constant
   stream of emotion to feed his court. When Leslie, the chosen mortal,
   gets a tattoo, the traditional tattoo ink is exchanged with the Dark
   Court's blood and tears, thereby joining the Dark King and the mortal.

   Soon, as an effect of the ink exchange, Leslie begins to feel and see
   as Irial would, seeing past faeries' human disguises. When she falls in
   love with Niall she avoids admitting her connection to his world. Her
   connection to the faeries deepens when she returns to the tattoo shop
   and begins to hear Irial's voice in her head. Irial has come to the
   conclusion that he loves her, and refuses to let any harm come to her.
   When Leslie goes to a club to celebrate her finished tattoo with Seth
   and Niall, Irial begins to speak through her to deflect the advances of
   other faeries. In the club, Irial and Leslie finally unite, connected
   by a shadow vine that represents the ink exchange. Niall, still in
   love, soon tells Leslie that he can help her break the bond with Irial,
   should she ever want to.

   Over the next few weeks, Leslie blurs in and out of consciousness,
   incapable of leaving Irial's side for more than a minute. When Leslie
   begins to understand that Irial is feeding on her negative emotions,
   leaving her incapable of feeling them, she realizes he has taken away
   her freedom to live. In an attempt to produce in Leslie more pain to
   feed his court, Irial and his faeries murder several human companions
   at once, displaying them in scenes from plays, a gross attempt at
   humor. When Leslie asks Niall to help free her, he uses sunlight and
   frost taken from the Winter and Summer Queens to burn and freeze the
   link and the tattoo off Leslie.

   Before restoring her human life and leaving the faerie world behind,
   Leslie goes to Irial one last time, asking him never to use the ink
   exchange on another human again. He solemnly agrees. The novel ends
   with Irial making Niall the new king of the dark court and them both
   watching Leslie and her new human friends.
