   Narrated by Robert Earle, a local carpenter who has lost his wife and
   son, the novel focuses on four separate "cultures" that represent the
   directions society could go after a breakdown of modern social norms.
   The citizens of Union Grove are living on the tail end of a national
   catastrophe, with their community slowly falling apart from neglect and
   natural decay. Within their community, a separate group of scrappers
   and thugs led by Wayne Karp run the "General Store" out of the town
   dump and live in a group of trailers known as Karptown. The third
   faction is led by Steven Bullock, a wealthy farmer with vision who has
   set his farm up like an English manor and strives to become
   self-sufficient. As the story begins Brother Jobe comes to town, the
   leader of the New Faith Church, a religious group that has fled the
   south and settle into the old high school. Much of the rest of the
   nation seems to be falling apart, with nuclear blasts destroying Los
   Angeles and Washington, D.C., cities devolving, and a fractured United
   States. All of these forces struggle to respect life in a way that was
   taken for granted before events changed, and build pragmatically for a
   new future. Earle's experiences are the focus of this struggle.

   Kunstler explores themes of local and sustainable living. In
   interviews, Kunstler describes his imaginary world as an "enlightened
   nineteenth century". The overarching premise, however, is a stark look
   into the future at the dire consequences of the poor American system of
   urban planning, and the complete lack of workability the contemporary
   suburban arrangement possesses without the continuous input of
   inexpensive and abundant energy to maintain its infrastructure. This
   has been the core theme of Kunstler's nonfiction works, including the
   Geography of Nowhere (1993) and The Long Emergency.
