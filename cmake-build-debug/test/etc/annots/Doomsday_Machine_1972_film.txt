   Doomsday Machine

   A spy (Essie Lin Chia) discovers that the Chinese government has
   created a doomsday device (the "key" to which, "only Chairman Mao has")
   capable of destroying the Earth and it will be activated in 72 hours.
   Soon after, Astra - a two-year return mission to Venus by the United
   States Space Program - has its time of launch speeded up and half of
   the male flight crew are replaced by women shortly before take-off,
   including one Russian. Shortly before blastoff military alerts are put
   into effect.

   After leaving Earth, the seven crew members of Astra deduce that they
   have been put together to restart the human race should the Chinese
   activate their device. Shortly after this, the device goes off and
   Earth is destroyed.

   As Astra continues to Venus, the crew realizes that a safe landing on
   Venus is impossible unless the crew is reduced to three. One of the
   crew members tries to rape another, at which point she accidentally
   gets them both blown out of an airlock.

   Two more crew-members--Danny and Major Bronski--are lost as they head
   out to repair a fault with the spaceship. However, they notice another
   spacecraft nearby and jump to it. The second craft proves to be a lost
   Soviet ship that disappeared piloted by a close friend of the Russian
   crew member. Though its pilot is dead, Danny and Bronski successfully
   power up the Soviet ship. Before the two ships can rendezvous, contact
   with Astra is lost.

   A disembodied voice cuts in, claiming to be the collective
   consciousness of the Venusian population. The voice informs the
   survivors (whom the Venusians refer to as the "Last of Man") in the
   Russian ship that Astra no longer exists (presumably destroyed somehow
   by the telepathic Venusians), and that no humans (due to their
   "self-destructive" potential) will be allowed to reach Venus. It gives
   a cryptic message regarding the prospect of starting new life in a
   "very strange and very great" place, somewhere far "beyond the rim of
   the universe," before the ship suddenly blasts off, apparently by the
   power of the Venusians, and the movie abruptly concludes.
