   Linda Martin lands in Paris on a cold, grey, rainy day. She is on her
   way to her new post as governess to the young Philippe, Comte de Valmy.
   Linda, who had been orphaned herself, quickly befriends Philippe, who
   has also lost both his parents in a tragic accident. The nine-year-old
   boy lives with his aunt and uncle in the vast and ornate Chateau Valmy
   in the alpine French countryside not far from Geneva, Switzerland. Leon
   de Valmy, Philippe's uncle, runs the estate on behalf of his under-age
   nephew until the boy inherits in six years and has arranged for a
   proper English governess for his charge. When Linda arrives at the
   imposing eighteenth-century chateau--a great mansion with its
   "four-square classic grace" that makes it less than a romantic castle
   with turrets and pinnacles but far more than a mere country
   house--she is at once enchanted by its beauty and history, but is also
   immediately struck by the sense of menace and doom surrounding its
   inhabitants. Leon is a charismatic force of nature and with a palpable
   charm, and, when Linda meets his dashing and devastatingly handsome
   son Raoul, she understands a bit more about the de Valmy heritage and
   what makes this family tick. As she becomes closer to Philippe and
   Raoul, Linda draws ever nearer to putting her finger on the source of
   the threat, but the layers of danger and darkness run deeper than any
   of them guessed, and she may not be able to trust those she wants to,
   no matter how innocent or attractive they may seem. Soon it is up to
   the shy, young governess to beat the clock in order to save Philippe's
   life as well as her own.
