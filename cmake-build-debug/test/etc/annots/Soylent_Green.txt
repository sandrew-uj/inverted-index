   By the year 2022, the cumulative effects of overpopulation, pollution,
   and some apparent climate catastrophe have caused severe worldwide
   shortages of food, water and housing. There are 40 million people in
   New York City alone, where only the city's elite can afford spacious
   apartments, clean water, and natural food, and even then at
   horrendously high prices. The homes of the elite usually include
   concubines who are referred to as "furniture" and serve the tenants as
   slaves.

   Within the city live NYPD detective Frank Thorn and his aged friend Sol
   Roth, a highly intelligent analyst, referred to as a "Book". Roth
   remembers the world when it had animals and real food, and possesses a
   small library of reference materials to assist Thorn. Thorn is tasked
   with investigating the murder of the wealthy and influential William R.
   Simonson, a board member of Soylent Industries. Thorn learns that
   Simonson was assassinated.

   Soylent Industries controls the food supply of half of the world and
   sells the homonymous brand of wafers, including "Soylent Red" and
   "Soylent Yellow". Their latest product is the far more flavorful and
   nutritious "Soylent Green", advertised as being made from ocean
   plankton, but is in short supply. As a result of the weekly supply
   bottlenecks, the hungry masses regularly riot, and they are brutally
   removed from the streets by means of police vehicles that scoop the
   rioters with large shovels and dump them within the vehicle's
   container.

   With the help of "furniture" Shirl, with whom Thorn begins a
   relationship, his investigation leads to a priest that Simonson had
   visited and confessed to shortly before his death. The priest is only
   able to hint at a gruesome truth before he himself is murdered. By
   order of the governor, Thorn is instructed to end the investigation,
   but he presses on. He is attacked during a riot, by the same assassin
   who killed Simonson, but the killer is crushed by a police vehicle.

   Roth brings two volumes of oceanographic reports Thorn had procured
   from Simonson's apartment to the team of Books at the Supreme Exchange.
   The books confirm that the oceans no longer produce plankton, and
   deduce that Soylent Green is produced from some inconceivable supply of
   protein. They also deduce that Simonson's murder was ordered by his
   fellow Soylent Industries board members, knowing he was increasingly
   troubled by the truth.

   Roth is so disgusted with his life in a degraded world that he decides
   to "return to the home of God" and seeks assisted suicide at a
   government clinic. Thorn finds a message left by Roth and rushes to
   stop him, but arrives too late. Roth and Thorn are mesmerized by the
   euthanasia process's visual and musical montage--long-gone forests,
   wild animals, rivers and ocean life. Before dying, Roth whispers what
   he has learned to Thorn, begging him to find proof, so that the Council
   of Nations can take action.

   Thorn boards a truck transporting bodies from the euthanasia center to
   a recycling plant, where the secret is revealed - human corpses are
   being converted into Soylent Green. Thorn is spotted and kills his
   attackers, but is himself wounded. As Thorn is tended to by paramedics,
   he urges his police chief to spread the truth he has discovered and
   initiate proceedings against the company. While being taken away, Thorn
   shouts out to the surrounding crowd, "Soylent Green is people!"
