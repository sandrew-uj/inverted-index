   Earth is a uniform, weakly structured, utopian society based on the
   mutual trust and conformity of its citizens. It is sleepy and stagnant,
   developing neither socially nor technologically. Its striking social
   stability is maintained by robots brainwashing children in "closed
   classes." The ideologies of both Earth and Omega resemble one another,
   differing only in words. On Omega, the citizens worship Evil (always
   capitalized) in a cult dedicated to an entity called The Black One. On
   Earth, the world religion is an amalgam of all the "good" aspects of
   previous Earth religions. Its institution is the Church of the Spirit
   of Mankind Incarnate.

   As Barrent comes closer to the truth about the reasons for his
   incarceration, his Omegan consciousness conflicts with his
   subconsciousness which was programmed in the closed classes by the
   robots when he was a child. The subsequent psychological struggle is
   played out by repeating all of the previous fights and battles which
   Barrent experienced throughout the book, eventually making clear the
   vision (or "skrenning") which the mutant girl on Omega foresaw of
   Barrent's death.
