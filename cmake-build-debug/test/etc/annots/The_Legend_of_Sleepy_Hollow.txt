     From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of
     its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch
     settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by name of
     Sleepy Hollow ... A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the
     land, and to pervade the very atmosphere.

   -- Washington Irving, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"

   The story is set in 1790 in the countryside around the Dutch settlement
   of Tarry Town (historical Tarrytown, New York), in a secluded glen
   known as Sleepy Hollow. Sleepy Hollow is renowned for its ghosts and
   the haunting atmosphere that pervades the imaginations of its
   inhabitants and visitors. Some residents say this town was bewitched
   during the early days of the Dutch settlement, while others claim that
   the mysterious atmosphere was caused by an old Native American chief,
   the "wizard of his tribe ... before the country was discovered by
   Master Hendrik Hudson." Residents of the town are seemingly subjected
   to various supernatural and mysterious occurrences. They are subjected
   to trance like visions and frequented by strange sights, music, and
   voices "in the air." The inhabitants of Sleepy Hallow are fascinated by
   the "local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions" on account
   of the mysterious occurrences and haunting atmosphere. The most
   infamous spectre in the Hollow, and the "commander-in-chief of all the
   powers of the air," is the Headless Horseman. He is supposedly the
   ghost of a Hessian trooper whose head had been shot off by a stray
   cannonball during "some nameless battle" of the Revolution, and who
   "rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head".

   The "Legend" relates the tale of Ichabod Crane, a lean, lanky and
   extremely superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut. Throughout his
   stay at Sleepy Hollow, Crane is able to make himself both "useful and
   agreeable" to the families that he lodges with. He occasionally assists
   with light farm work, helping to make hay, mend fences, caring for
   numerous farm animals, and cutting firewood. Besides his more dominant
   role as the Schoolmaster, Ichabod Crane also assists the various
   mothers of the town by helping to take care of their young children,
   taking on a more "gentle and ingratiating" role. Crane is also quite
   popular among the women of the town for his education and his talent
   for "carrying the whole budget of local gossip," which makes him a
   welcomed sight within female circles. As a firm believer in witchcraft
   and the like, Crane has an unequaled "appetite for the marvelous,"
   which is only increased by his stay in "the spell-bound region" of
   Sleepy Hollow. A source of "fearful pleasure" for Crane is to visit the
   Old Dutch wives and listen to their "marvelous tales of ghosts and
   goblins," haunted locations, and the tales of the Headless Horseman, or
   the ...Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him."
   Throughout the story, Ichabod Crane competes with Abraham "Brom Bones"
   Van Brunt, the town rowdy, for the hand of 18-year-old Katrina Van
   Tassel, the daughter and sole child of wealthy farmer Baltus Van
   Tassel. Ichabod Crane, a Yankee and an outsider, sees marriage to
   Katrina as a means of procuring Van Tassel's extravagant wealth. Bones,
   the local hero, unable to force Ichabod into a physical showdown to
   settle things, plays a series of pranks on the superstitious
   schoolmaster. The tension among the three continues for some time, and
   is soon brought to a head. On a placid autumn night, the ambitious
   Crane attends a harvest party at the Van Tassels' homestead. He dances,
   partakes in the feast, and listens to ghostly legends told by Brom and
   the locals, but his true aim is to propose to Katrina after the guests
   leave. His intentions, however, are ill-fated.

   After having failed to secure Katrina's hand, Ichabod rides home on his
   temperamental horse (named Gunpowder) "heavy-hearted and crestfallen"
   through the woods between Van Tassel's farmstead and the farmhouse in
   Sleepy Hollow where he is quartered at the time. As he passes several
   purportedly haunted spots, his active imagination is engorged by the
   ghost stories told at Baltus' harvest party. After nervously passing a
   lightning-stricken tulip tree purportedly haunted by the ghost of
   British spy Major Andre, Ichabod encounters a cloaked rider at an
   intersection in a menacing swamp. Unsettled by his fellow traveler's
   eerie size and silence, the teacher is horrified to discover that his
   companion's head is not on his shoulders, but on his saddle. In a
   frenzied race to the bridge adjacent to the Old Dutch Burying Ground,
   where the Hessian is said to "vanish, according to rule, in a flash of
   fire and brimstone" before crossing it, Ichabod rides for his life,
   desperately goading Gunpowder down the Hollow. However, while Crane and
   Gunpowder are able to cross the bridge ahead of the ghoul, Ichabod
   turns back in horror to see the monster rear his horse and hurl his
   severed head directly at him with a fierce motion. The schoolmaster
   attempts to dodge, but is too late; the missile strikes his head and
   sends him tumbling headlong into the dust from his horse.

   The next morning, Ichabod has mysteriously disappeared from the area,
   leaving Katrina to later marry Brom Bones, who was said "to look
   exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related". Indeed,
   the only relics of the schoolmaster's flight are his discarded hat,
   Gunpowder's trampled saddle, and a mysterious shattered pumpkin.
   Although the true nature of both the Headless Horseman and Ichabod's
   disappearance that night are left open to interpretation, the story
   implies that the Horseman was really Brom (an extremely agile rider) in
   disguise, and suggests that Crane survived the fall from Gunpowder and
   immediately fled Sleepy Hollow in horror, never to return but to
   prosper elsewhere, or perhaps was killed by Brom himself. Irving's
   narrator concludes the story, however, by stating that the old Dutch
   wives continue to promote the belief that Ichabod was "spirited away by
   supernatural means", and a legend develops around his disappearance and
   sightings of his melancholy spirit.

   In a Postscript (sometimes unused in certain editions), the narrator
   states the circumstances in which he heard the story from an old
   gentleman "at a Corporation meeting at the ancient city of Manhattoes",
   who didn't "believe one-half of it ."
