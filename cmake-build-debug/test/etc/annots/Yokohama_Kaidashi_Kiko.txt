   Yokohama Kaidashi Kiko is set in a peaceful, post-cataclysmic world
   where mankind is in decline after an environmental disaster. Exactly
   what happened is never explained, but sea levels have risen
   significantly, inundating coastal cities such as Yokohama, Mount Fuji
   erupted in living memory, and climate change has occurred. With the
   seasons being less pronounced, the winters are milder and the summer
   isn't scorching anymore. The reduced human population has reverted to a
   simpler life, and the reader is told this is the twilight of the human
   age. One scene depicts an anti-aircraft missile being used in a
   firework display. Instead of raging against their fate, humans are
   quietly accepting.

   Alpha Hatsuseno is an android ("robot person") who runs an
   out-of-the-way coffee shop, Cafe Alpha, on the lonely coast of the
   Miura Peninsula of Japan, while her human "owner" is on a trip of
   indefinite length. Though she spends much of her time alone, Alpha
   is cheerful, gregarious, and--unlike the slowly declining
   humans--immortal.

   Most chapters of Yokohama Kaidashi Kiko are self-contained
   slice-of-life episodes depicting Alpha in daily activities, either
   alone, with customers, or on occasional trips through the countryside
   or into Yokohama for supplies (whence the "shopping log" of the title
   came). Whole chapters are devoted to brewing coffee, taking
   photographs, or repairing a tiny model aircraft engine, sometimes with
   only a few lines of dialogue. Through Alpha's experiences, the author
   brings out the small wonders of everyday life and makes the reader
   aware of their passing: the aircraft engine runs out of fuel; her
   scooter breaks down; the rising ocean encroaches on her coffee shop;
   the neighborhood children she loves grow up and move away. In evoking a
   nostalgia for this loss, Ashinano follows the Japanese tradition of
   mono no aware (sadness for the transience of things).

   Though often self-contained, the stories have continuity--relationships
   grow and change, and seemingly insignificant details reappear
   later. Ashinano explains few details of Alpha's world, leaving
   mysteries that engage the reader as the series unfolds in a
   meandering progression, by turns funny, touching, and
   nostalgic.
