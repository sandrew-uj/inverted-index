   The book follows Pellam as he tries to prove the innocence of an old
   woman, Ettie, whom he had interviewed for a documentary on the area of
   New York City referred to as Hell's Kitchen. When Ettie's apartment
   catches fire, she is blamed for the crime and jailed. Pellam believes
   she is innocent and is determined to prove it and set her free. Along
   the way he meets several characters who try to interrupt his search as
   it uncovers many underlying crimes of different people. All the while,
   the real arsonist, a man named Sonny, has been continuing to burn
   buildings and chase Pellam.

   Towards the end of the book, Sonny finally confronts Pellam, attempting
   to kill him (and Sonny himself in the process). However, just when it
   appears Pellam is about to die, two friends he has made along his
   investigation come to his aid and save him from Sonny. Pellam gathers
   the evidence needed to prove Ettie innocent and she is set free.
