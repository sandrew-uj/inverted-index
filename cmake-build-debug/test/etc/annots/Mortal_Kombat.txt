   The series takes place in a fictional universe consisting of eighteen
   surviving realms which, according to in-game backstories, were created
   by the Elder Gods. The Mortal Kombat: Deception manual described six of
   the realms as: "Earthrealm, home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang,
   Kung Lao, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, and Jax Briggs, and also under the
   protection of the Thunder God Raiden; Netherrealm, the fiery depths of
   which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, a realm of demons and
   shadowy warriors such as Quan Chi and Noob Saibot; Outworld, a realm of
   constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own; Seido, the
   Realm of Order, whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all
   else; the Realm of Chaos, whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules
   whatsoever, and where constant turmoil and change are worshiped; and
   Edenia, which is known for its beauty, artistic expression, and the
   longevity of its inhabitants." The Elder Gods decreed that
   the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating
   the defending realm's greatest warriors in ten consecutive Mortal
   Kombat tournaments.

   The first Mortal Kombat game takes place in Earthrealm (Earth) where
   seven different warriors with their own reasons for entering
   participated in the tournament with the prize being the continued
   freedom of their realm under threat of a takeover by Outworld. Among
   the established warriors were Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade.
   With the help of the thunder god Raiden, the Earthrealm warriors were
   victorious and Liu Kang became the new champion of Mortal Kombat.
   In Mortal Kombat II, unable to deal with his minion Shang Tsung's
   failure, Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn lures the Earthrealm warriors to
   Outworld, where Liu Kang eventually defeats Shao Kahn. By the time of
   Mortal Kombat 3, Shao Kahn merged Edenia with his empire and revived
   its former queen Sindel in Earthrealm, combining it with Outworld as
   well. He attempts to invade Earthrealm, but is ultimately defeated by
   Liu Kang once more. After the Kahn's defeat, Edenia was freed from his
   grasp and returned to a peaceful realm, ruled by Princess Kitana. The
   following game, Mortal Kombat 4, features the fallen elder god Shinnok
   attempting to conquer the realms and kill Raiden. However, he is also
   defeated by Liu Kang.

   In Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, the evil sorcerers Quan Chi and
   Shang Tsung join forces to conquer the realms. By Mortal Kombat:
   Deception, after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious;
   having killed most of Earthrealm's warriors until Raiden steps forth to
   oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by the warrior
   Reptile at the end of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, had deceived
   Shujinko into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu, the source of
   Onaga's power. Onaga confronted the alliance of Raiden, Shang Tsung,
   and Quan Chi to obtain Quan Chi's amulet, the final piece of his
   power. Only a few warriors remained to combat the Dragon King and his
   forces. Shujinko eventually triumphed over Onaga and removed his threat
   from the realms.

   In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, the titular catastrophe begins. Centuries
   before the first Mortal Kombat, Queen Delia foretold the realms would
   be destroyed because the power of all of the realms' warriors would
   rise to such greatness that it would overwhelm and destabilize the
   realms, triggering a destructive chain of events. King Argus had his
   sons, Taven and Daegon put into incubation and so one day they can be
   awakened to save the realms from Armageddon by defeating a firespawn
   known as Blaze. In the end however, Shao Kahn is the one who defeats
   Blaze, causing Armageddon.

   The crossover Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe does not share continuity
   with the other games. After the simultaneous defeats of both Shao Kahn
   and the alien warlord Darkseid in the DC Universe causes both villains
   to fuse into the entity "Dark Kahn", both the Mortal Kombat and DC
   Universes begin to merge. This brings the warriors and heroes into
   conflicts after suffering bouts of uncontrollable rage. The heroes and
   villains of both universes repeatedly battle each other, believing each
   other to be responsible for the catastrophe, until only Raiden and
   Superman remain. The two confront Dark Kahn and team up to defeat their
   common foe. After Dark Kahn's defeat, the two realms defuse, with Shao
   Kahn and Darkseid trapped in each other's universes to face eternal
   imprisonment.

   In the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, the battle of Armageddon culminated
   in only two survivors: Shao Kahn and Raiden. On the verge of death by
   the former's hand, the latter sent visions to his past self in a last
   ditch attempt to prevent this outcome. Upon receiving the visions, the
   past Raiden attempts to alter the timeline to avert Armageddon amidst
   the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament. While he succeeds in preventing
   Shao Kahn's victory with help from the Elder Gods, he is forced to kill
   Liu Kang in self-defense and loses most of his allies to Queen Sindel;
   leaving Earthrealm vulnerable to Shinnok and Quan Chi's machinations.

   Mortal Kombat X sees Shinnok and Quan Chi enacting their plan, leading
   an army of undead revenants of those that were killed in Shao Kahn's
   invasion of Earthrealm. A team of warriors led by Raiden, Johnny Cage,
   Kenshi Takahashi, and Sonya Blade oppose them, and in the ensuing
   battle, Shinnok is imprisoned within his amulet and various warriors
   are resurrected and freed from his control, though Quan Chi escapes.
   Twenty-five years later, the sorcerer resurfaces alongside the
   insectoid D'Vorah to facilitate Shinnok's return. A vengeful Scorpion
   kills Quan Chi, but fails to stop him from freeing Shinnok. To combat
   him, Cassie Cage leads a team composed of the next generation of
   Earthrealm's heroes in defeating him. With Shinnok and Quan Chi
   defeated, Liu Kang and Kitana's revenants assume control of the
   Netherrealm while Raiden taps into Shinnok's amulet.

   Mortal Kombat 11 sees the architect of time and Shinnok's Mother,
   Kronika, working to restart the timeline following her son's defeat and
   Raiden's tampering with her work. In doing so, she brings past versions
   of the realm's heroes to the present, aligning herself with some while
   the rest work to defeat her. After nearly killing Liu Kang a second
   time, Raiden discovers Kronika has manipulated them into fighting
   across multiple timelines as she fears their combined power. Despite
   her interference and attacks by her minions, Raiden gives Liu Kang his
   power, turning him into a god of fire and thunder so he can defeat
   Kronika and start history anew.

   In MK11's expansion, Aftermath, Shang Tsung interferes given that
   Kronika's broken crown needs to be restored for the great reset to be
   successful. At the end the player can choose your ultimate destiny in
   deciding whether Tsung or the fire god will prevail.
