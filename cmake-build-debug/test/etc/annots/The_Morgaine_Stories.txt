   The Morgaine Stories, also known as The Morgaine Cycle, are a series of
   science fantasy novels by American writer C. J. Cherryh, published by
   DAW Books. They concern a time-traveling heroine, Morgaine, and her
   loyal companion Nhi Vanye i Chya.

   The first book in the series, Gate of Ivrel (1976), was Cherryh's first
   published novel, and was followed soon thereafter by Well of Shiuan
   (1978) and Fires of Azeroth (1979). These three works have been
   subsequently released in omnibus editions under various titles,
   including The Book of Morgaine, The Chronicles of Morgaine, and The
   Morgaine Saga. In 1988, Cherryh published a fourth book in the series,
   Exile's Gate. The series has sold in excess of 3 million
   copies.^[citation needed]

   In the 1980s, Jane Fancher began a graphic novel adaptation of Gate of
   Ivrel in close collaboration with Cherryh. Although it was never
   completed, Fancher self-published one segment of the work with a color
   cover and black and white interior art entitled C. J. Cherryh's Gate of
   Ivrel No. 1 (1985). Two parts of the adaptation were subsequently
   published as full color versions by The Donning Company under its
   Starblaze Graphics imprint: Gate of Ivrel: Claiming Rites (1986) and
   Gate of Ivrel: Fever Dreams (1987). In 1987, Tor Books published an
   interactive novel set in Morgaine's universe, The Witchfires of Leth.

   This series has been identified as being set in the Alliance-Union
   universe, as it is stated that Morgaine was sent on her quest by the
   "Union Science Bureau".
