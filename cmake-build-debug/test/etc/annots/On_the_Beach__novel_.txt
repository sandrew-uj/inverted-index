   The story is set primarily in and around Melbourne, Australia, in 1963.
   World War III has devastated most of the populated world, polluting the
   atmosphere with nuclear fallout, and killing all human and animal life
   in the Northern Hemisphere. The war began with a nuclear attack by
   Albania on Italy, and then escalated with the bombing of the United
   States and the United Kingdom by Egypt. Because the aircraft used in
   these attacks were obtained from the Soviet Union, the Soviets were
   mistakenly blamed, triggering a retaliatory strike on the Soviet Union
   by NATO.

   There is also an attack by the Soviets on the People's Republic of
   China, which may have been a response to a Chinese attack aimed at
   occupying Soviet industrial areas near the Chinese border. Most, if not
   all, of the bombs included cobalt to enhance their radioactive
   properties.

   Global air currents are slowly carrying the lethal nuclear fallout
   across the Intertropical Convergence Zone, to the Southern Hemisphere.
   The only parts of the planet still habitable are Australia, New
   Zealand, South Africa, and the southern parts of South America,
   although they are slowly succumbing to radiation poisoning as well.
   Life in Melbourne continues reasonably normally, although the
   near-complete lack of motor fuels makes traveling difficult.

   People in Australia detect a mysterious and incomprehensible Morse code
   radio signal originating from the American city of Seattle, Washington.
   With hope that someone has survived in the contaminated regions, one of
   the last American nuclear submarines, USS Scorpion, placed by its
   captain, Commander Dwight Towers, under Australian naval command, is
   ordered to sail north from its port of refuge in Melbourne (Australia's
   southernmost major mainland city) to contact whoever is sending the
   signal. In preparation for this journey, the submarine makes a shorter
   trip to port cities in northern Australia, including Cairns,
   Queensland, and Darwin, Northern Territory; no survivors are found. Two
   Australians sail with the American crew: Lieutenant Peter Holmes, naval
   liaison officer to the Americans, and a scientist, Professor John
   Osborne.

   Commander Towers has become attached to a young Australian woman
   distantly related to Osborne, named Moira Davidson, who tries to cope
   with the impending end of human life through heavy drinking. Despite
   his attraction to Davidson, Towers remains loyal to his wife and
   children in the United States. He buys his children gifts and imagines
   their growing older. At one point, however, he makes it clear to Moira
   that he knows his family is almost certainly dead, and he asks her if
   she thinks he is insane for acting as if they were still alive. She
   replies that she does not think he is crazy.

   The Australian government provides citizens with free suicide pills and
   injections so they can avoid prolonged suffering from radiation
   poisoning. Periodic reports show the steady southward progression of
   the deadly radiation. As communications are lost with a city, it is
   referred to as being "out."

   One of the novel's poignant dilemmas is that of Peter Holmes, who has a
   baby daughter and a naive wife, Mary, who is in denial about the
   impending disaster. Because he has been assigned to travel north with
   the Americans, Peter tries to explain, to Mary's fury and disbelief,
   how to kill their baby and herself, by taking the suicide pill should
   he not return from his mission in time to help. The bachelor Osborne
   spends much of his time restoring and subsequently racing a Ferrari
   racing car that he had purchased (along with a fuel supply) for a
   nominal amount following the war's outbreak.

   The submarine travels to the Gulf of Alaska in the northern Pacific
   Ocean, where the crew determines that radiation levels are not
   decreasing. This finding discredits the "Jorgensen Effect", a
   scientific theory positing that radiation levels will decrease at a
   much greater rate than previously thought, aided by the weather
   effects, and potentially allow for human life to continue in southern
   Australia or at least Antarctica.

   The submarine approaches San Francisco, observing through the periscope
   that the city had been devastated and the Golden Gate Bridge has
   fallen. In contrast, the Puget Sound area, from which the strange radio
   signals are emanating, is found to have avoided destruction because of
   missile defences. One crew member, who is from Edmonds, Washington,
   which the expedition visits, jumps ship to spend his last days in his
   home town.

   The expedition members then sail to an abandoned navy communications
   school south of Seattle. A crewman sent ashore with oxygen tanks and
   protective gear discovers that although the city's residents have long
   since perished, some of the region's hydroelectric power is still
   working due to primitive automation technology. He finds that the
   mysterious radio signal is the result of a broken window sash swinging
   in the breeze and occasionally hitting a telegraph key. After a brief
   stop at Pearl Harbor, the remaining submariners return to Australia to
   live out what little time they have left.

   Osborne takes his suicide pill while sitting in his beloved racing car.
   When Mary Holmes becomes very ill, Peter administers a lethal injection
   to their daughter. Even though he still feels relatively well, he and
   Mary take their pills simultaneously so they can die as a family.
   Towers and his remaining crew choose to scuttle the Scorpion in the
   open ocean, fulfilling a naval duty to not leave the unmanned vessel
   "floating about in a foreign port", after her crew succumbs to suicide
   or radiation poisoning. Moira watches the submarine's departure in her
   car, parked atop an adjacent hilltop, as she takes her suicide pill,
   imagining herself together with Towers as she dies.
