   The inhabitants of post-apocalypse Labrador have vague knowledge of the
   "Old People", a technologically advanced civilization they believe was
   destroyed when God sent "Tribulation" to the world to punish their
   forebears' sins. The inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist
   Christianity; they believe that to follow God's word and prevent
   another Tribulation, they must preserve absolute normality among the
   surviving humans, plants and animals, and therefore practice eugenics.
   Humans with even minor mutations are considered blasphemies and either
   killed or sterilized and banished to the Fringes, a lawless and untamed
   area rife with animal and plant mutations, and suggested to be
   contaminated with radiation. Arguments occur over the keeping of a
   tailless cat or the possession of over-sized horses. These are deemed
   by the government to be legitimate breeds, either preexisting or
   achieved through conventional breeding. The government's position is
   considered both cynical and heretical by many of the orthodox frontier
   community, and it is suggested that they support the usage of these
   animals for the sole purpose of their greater efficiency.

   The inland rural settlement of Waknuk is a frontier farming community,
   populated with hardy and pious individuals, and is where the story
   mainly takes place. David Strorm, the son of Waknuk's most religious
   man, Joseph Strorm, has dreams of large cities and "horseless carts",
   although he does not understand why he has these dreams or what they
   mean, and is cautious about mentioning it to his father, lest he raise
   suspicion that he's a mutant. He makes friends with Sophie, a girl who
   secretly has six toes on one of her feet. Later, Sophie's family
   attempts to escape from the reprisals (ceremonies in which blasphemies
   are sterilized) when her wet footprints are seen and reported by a
   local boy.

   David and other children in Waknuk hide their own form of mutation:
   telepathy. David's Uncle Axel, who learned about the group from talking
   to David about his telepathy when he was young, advises David and
   protects them from persecution. He advises David on the wisdom of
   hiding his and the others' ability, and later kills the husband of one
   of the group's members who was planning to blackmail the telepaths.
   David's younger sister Petra demonstrates exceptionally strong
   telepathic talent when her horse is attacked by a wildcat - she calls
   to all the telepaths for help across the entire Waknuk area, and stuns
   those closest to her. That leads to suspicion from the locals, and
   Uncle Axel warns the group, via David, that the Inspectors are
   beginning to investigate them.

   Later, two telepaths, Katherine and Sally, are captured and tortured
   for information, while David, his cousin Rosalind, and Petra escape to
   the Fringes. A group of men from various districts band together to
   track and capture the telepaths - unknown to the Norms, the posse
   includes a telepath named Michael who keeps the escaping group informed
   of the trackers' progress. Later, with Petra's strong telepathic
   abilities, they contact a society with telepaths in a different country
   they mistakenly refer to as "Sealand" (New Zealand). With the help of
   Sophie, who is now living in the Fringes, they escape the hunters and
   are rescued by a Sealand expedition. Unfortunately, they do not have
   enough fuel to take the craft back to Waknuk to pick up Rachel, the
   lone remaining Waknuk telepath, so they continue to Sealand. Michael
   vows to return to Waknuk to rescue Rachel, and join them in Sealand
   however they can.
