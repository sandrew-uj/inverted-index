   When an IRA terrorist car bomb explodes, the wife and children of
   molecular biologist John Roe O'Neill are indiscriminately killed on May
   20, 1996. Driven halfway insane by loss, his mind fragments into
   several personalities that carry out his plan for him. He plans a
   gendercidal revenge and creates a plague that kills only women, but for
   which men are the carriers. O'Neill then releases it in Ireland (for
   supporting the IRA), England (for their actions in Ireland and giving
   the IRA a cause), and Libya (for training said terrorists); he demands
   that the governments of the world send all citizens of those countries
   back to their countries, and that they quarantine those countries and
   let the plague run its course, so they will lose what he has lost; if
   they do not, he has more plagues to release.

   After releasing the plague, he goes to Ireland to hide, planning to
   offer his services as a molecular biologist in the hopes of sabotaging
   whatever work is done there on finding a cure. When he arrives in
   Ireland, he is suspected of being O'Neill (whom the investigatory
   agencies of the world have deduced is responsible). To travel to the
   lab at Killaloe, he is forced to walk with a priest, a boy who has
   taken a vow of silence due to the death of his mother, and Joseph
   Herity, the IRA bomber who detonated the explosive that killed
   O'Neill's wife and children; their purpose is to confirm his identity,
   either through Herity's indirect questioning, or the possibility that
   he will confess to the priest when confronted with the pain his revenge
   has caused for the boy.

   Meanwhile, law and order have broken down in England and Ireland, and
   the old Irish ways are coming back. Local IRA thugs appoint themselves
   "kings of old", and others recreate ancient Celtic pagan religions
   centered on the rowan tree. The IRA has effective control of Ireland,
   but as the governments of the world grow certain that O'Neill is there
   and essentially in custody, they consider wiping out the three targeted
   countries to end the lingering threat.
