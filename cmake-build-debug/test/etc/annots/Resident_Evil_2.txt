   On September 29, 1998, two months after the events of the first
   Resident Evil, most citizens of the Midwestern American mountain
   community Raccoon City have been transformed into zombies by the
   T-virus, a biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical
   company Umbrella. Leon S. Kennedy, a police officer on his
   first day of duty, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for
   her brother Chris, make their way to the Raccoon Police
   Department. They discover that most of the police force have been
   killed, and that Chris has left town to investigate Umbrella's
   headquarters in Europe. They split up to look for survivors and
   find a way out of the city. While searching for an escape
   route, Claire meets a little girl, Sherry Birkin, who is on the run
   from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to
   be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher from
   Chicago.

   Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons had been bribed by Umbrella to
   hide evidence of the company's experiments in the outskirts of the
   city. He concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent
   capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon
   has multiple encounters with a Tyrant, a monster air-dropped into the
   Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries
   to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police
   department. Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become
   separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada finds Sherry and picks up
   a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the
   sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on
   his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires
   at Ada, but Leon jumps between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada
   ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself
   to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the
   Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect
   his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters,
   he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed
   creature and is now chasing Sherry because of her genetic make-up.
   Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from
   Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a
   railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of
   the G-virus, and later - taken over by her emotions - returns to Leon,
   tending to his bullet wound.

   Meanwhile, Claire is reunited with Sherry and discovers that William
   has implanted his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon,
   Ada, Claire, and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected
   to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by
   William leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory to
   find something to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a
   psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with
   John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a
   spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization.
   Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is
   forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant -
   which falls into a pit of molten metal - seemingly at the cost of her
   own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her
   motionless body, however, Ada survives. Meanwhile, Annette tries to
   escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her
   mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to
   create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo
   within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an
   emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves
   her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated
   Super Tyrant by Ada who escapes with the G-virus in the
   pendant. William--now mutated into an agglomeration of flesh
   and teeth--follows Leon and Claire, but is destroyed when the train
   self-destructs. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon
   intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for
   Chris. HUNK, one of the surviving special agents sent by
   Umbrella, completes his G-virus retrieval mission.
