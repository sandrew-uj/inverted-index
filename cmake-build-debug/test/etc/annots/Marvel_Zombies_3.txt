   Zombies invade Earth-616, the original Marvel Universe, by entering
   through the Nexus of Realities in Florida. Siege, Jennifer Kale,
   Wundarr and the Conquistador (Juan Ponce de Leon, who as a Roman
   Catholic regards his foes as demons), local members of the Fifty-State
   Initiative, investigate but are attacked by zombie Deadpool and a
   few zombified civilians. The zombies kill the Conquistador, and infect
   Siege and Wundarr. A horrified Kale destroys Deadpool's body with an
   airboat. Siege's robotics detect the biological corruption and he
   self-terminates. Wundarr goes into hibernation to purge himself. A
   traumatized Jennifer Kale awaits in an observation room back at
   headquarters.

   Back at A.R.M.O.R., Machine Man and Jocasta travel to the Marvel Zombie
   universe to find DNA with Little Sky so they can find an uninfected
   human for Morbius, now an A.R.M.O.R. scientist, to make a vaccine
   against the zombie plague so the 616 heroes can be inoculated against
   the virus. While the heroes are gone, it is revealed that Morbius is
   the zombie version, who has kidnapped the real one.

   The two heroes find that "human" readings are really coming from clones
   generated by the zombie Kingpin, via his resources and created by the
   zombie Jackal, now used as the zombies' sole food source under
   Kingpin's control. As they watch, the zombified Inhumans arrive and are
   welcomed by Kingpin (who tells the now prolix Black Bolt to shut up).

   Machine Man and Jocasta stumble upon Vanessa Fisk, who is uninfected.
   She tells them that the Kingpin is keeping her safe. She allows Jocasta
   to get a blood sample, but declines an offer to escape to Earth-616,
   preferring to stay behind with her husband. Looking at the dead and
   dying bodies in the pit, Machine Man is overcome with pity, realizing
   that the zombies are treating the clones the way humans treat robots.
   He leaves Jocasta, goes into battle mode and destroys the clones out of
   mercy and gets attacked by the zombies, and he has destroyed their food
   source.

   A severely injured and sessile zombie Doctor Strange appears in the
   plot line; has only the powers to create manna (ironically inedible for
   the zombies) and to see other dimensions. He thus reveals A.R.M.O.R.'s
   operations on Earth-616. Machine Man sees that the impostor Morbius
   used Deadpool to create a distraction so that he could set his plans in
   motion.

   On the real Marvel Universe, a female team member finds the real
   Morbius captive. The infected version attacks and turns her, causing a
   zombie outbreak that quickly overtakes the entire facility. Little Sky
   returns Jocasta to A.R.M.O.R. without Machine Man, who didn't meet them
   on time, and Jocasta requests that Machine Man be given posthumous
   honors. Jocasta discovers Morbius is a zombie, and one zombie uses the
   A.R.M.O.R. teleporters to escape this reality.

   In the zombie universe, Machine Man defeats the zombies, leaving only
   zombie Lockjaw, whom Machine Man uses to teleport back to A.R.M.O.R.,
   where he kills the zombies. (Immediately thereafter he queries Jocasta
   about having some "...sweet, sweet robot love" in a secluded spot,
   whereupon they kiss.)

   The real Morbius kills his zombie counterpart and escapes. Jocasta and
   Machine Man return to S.H.I.E.L.D., and Morbius volunteers to follow
   the zombie that teleported away, along with a new team of Midnight
   Sons.
