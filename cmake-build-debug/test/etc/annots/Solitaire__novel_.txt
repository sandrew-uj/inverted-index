   Jackal Segura was born to a life rich with responsibility and privilege
   and will soon become part of the global administration, sponsored by
   the huge corporation that houses, feeds, employs, and protects her and
   everyone she loves. However, just as she discovers that everything
   she's been brought up to believe is a lie, she is convicted of murder.
   Grief-stricken and alone, she is sentenced to years of virtual solitary
   confinement compressed into a few months. When finally released,
   branded and despised, she struggles to rebuild her life, love, and soul
   in a strange place called Solitaire.
