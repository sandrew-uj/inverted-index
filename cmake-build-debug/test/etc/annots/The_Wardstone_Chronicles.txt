   Spook's follow Thomas "Tom" Ward, the seventh son of a seventh son who
   is apprenticed to Gregory to become a Spook - a master fighter of
   supernatural evil. John Gregory is the Spook for "the County" and gives
   Tom practical instruction on tackling ghosts, ghasts, witches,
   boggarts, and all manner of other things that serve "The Dark". Tom
   soon discovers that most of John Gregory's apprentices have failed for
   various reasons, including being killed in the process of learning how
   to be a Spook. As the Chronicles progress the focus expands to other
   characters such as the assassin Grimalkin and the young witch Alice
   Deane; overall the series develops the plotline of Tom being destined
   to save the world or be tortured by the Fiend, the father of all evil,
   for all eternity.

   "The County" referenced in the Chronicles is based on Lancashire in the
   North of England. Various County fictional towns are thinly-veiled
   modern day cities; for example, the town of Priestown is based on
   Preston (where author Delaney was born); Caster is Lancaster; Black
   Pool is Blackpool; Chipenden is Chipping.^[4]

   The first series, titled The Wardstone Chronicles, concluded in 2014,
   and was followed by The Starblade Chronicles in 2015, a trilogy
   following the continued adventures of Tom Ward, who has finished his
   apprenticeship and is now a Spook in his own right dedicated to
   fighting an unparalleled evil threatening the County, and the world.
