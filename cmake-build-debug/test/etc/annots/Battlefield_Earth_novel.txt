   In the year 3000, Earth has been ruled by an alien race, the Psychlos,
   for a millennium. The Psychlos discovered a deep space probe with
   directions and pictures mounted on it and the precious material, gold,
   that led them straight to Earth. After one thousand years humanity is
   an endangered species numbering fewer than 35,000 and reduced to a few
   tribes in isolated parts of the world while the Psychlos strip the
   planet of its mineral wealth. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, a young man in one
   such tribe, lives in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains. Depressed by
   the recent death of his father and both the lethargy and sickness of
   most of the surviving adults in his tribe, later determined to be
   caused by radiation leakage from decaying nuclear land mines (Jonnie is
   unaffected as he refused to go to the irradiated area), he leaves his
   village to explore the lowlands and to disprove the superstitions long
   held by his people of monsters in those areas. He is captured in the
   ruins of Denver by Terl, the Psychlo chief of planetary security.

   Psychlos stand up to 9 feet (2.7 m) tall and weigh up to 1,000 pounds
   (450 kg). They originate from Psychlo, a planet with an atmosphere
   radically different from Earth, located in a different universe with a
   different set of elements. Their "breathe-gas" explodes on contact with
   even trace amounts of radioactive material, such as uranium. The
   Psychlos have been the dominant species across multiple universes for
   at least 100,000 years. It becomes apparent in the later chapters that
   the Psychlos were originally nonviolent miners but were subjugated by a
   ruling class called "Catrists" to become malicious, sadistic
   sociopaths.

   Terl has been assigned to Earth, and his term has been arbitrarily
   extended by Numph, the planetary head of mining operations. Fearful at
   the thought of spending several more years on Earth, Terl decides to
   make himself a millionaire to escape, by secretly mining a lode of gold
   in the Rocky Mountains that his planetary scanner drones have recently
   found. It is surrounded by uranium deposits that make Psychlo mining
   impossible, so Terl captures Jonnie to mine the gold for him.

   Terl forces Jonnie to submit to a learning machine programmed by a
   servile race exterminated for going on strike. It quickly teaches him
   numerous subjects, including the Psychlo language, by implanting the
   information directly into Jonnie's brain. He befriends a Psychlo midget
   named Ker, who is only 7 feet tall but still possesses the impressive
   strength of a Psychlo, and is markedly less psychotic than the others.

   Looking for leverage against Jonnie, Terl captures Jonnie's childhood
   love Chrissie and her sister, Pattie, who went searching for Jonnie,
   and holds them hostage to ensure his continued cooperation. Thereafter,
   Jonnie is free to move around the mining area. Terl and Jonnie travel
   to Scotland where Jonnie recruits eighty-three Scottish people,
   including several deliberately selected body doubles for Jonnie, older
   women to perform the cooking and clothes mending, a doctor, a teacher
   and a historian, to help with the mining. Jonnie tells the Scots about
   the evil deeds of Terl, to include how he has imprisoned Jonnie's love
   and her little sister. Led by Robert the Fox, the Scots agree to help
   him fight against the Psychlo rule on Earth and rescue Chrissie and
   Pattie. Terl does not understand English, and is instead convinced that
   the Scots are motivated by a promise of pay on project completion.

   While Jonnie and his Scottish allies mine the gold deposit, they also
   secretly explore the ruins of humanity to look for uranium that can be
   weaponized for use against their Psychlo oppressors. This subterfuge is
   aided by the aforementioned body doubles, making it appear to Terl's
   surveillance that the mining operation is the sole priority of the
   human contingent. Meanwhile, Terl has finally gained leverage on Numph
   after discovering he has been stealing company funds. Terl blackmails
   Numph, and is now able to do whatever he wants, effectively negating
   Numph's power over him. Terl has been busy obfuscating the purpose of
   the gold mining operation and implementing his plan to ship the
   human-mined gold back to the Psychlo home planet. Terl's plan involves
   replacing lead coffin lids with lead-plated facsimiles made from the
   gold mined by the Scots, and shipping these coffins with dead Psychlos
   in them, home. When he finally returned to Psychlo, he could then dig
   up the coffins and sell the lids to make his fortune. All dead Psychlos
   are to be returned to home planet for burial, but recent safety
   measures have reduced accidents. Terl thus has to manufacture accidents
   to kill Psychlos, as well as assassinate Numph, to get the bodies
   needed.

   During the semiannual teleportation of personnel, goods, and coffins to
   Psychlo, Jonnie and his allies co-opt Terl's plan by packing the
   coffins with "dirty nukes" and "planet busters", and replacing the gold
   coffin lids with the original lead lids. After the last teleportation,
   the humans use the Psychlos' own weapons against them and gain control
   of the planet. With humans in control of Earth, Jonnie works to
   discover the secret of Psychlo mathematics and teleportation: a
   difficult task compounded by the fact that Psychlo math is based on the
   number eleven, not to mention that Psychlo equations appear to make no
   sense. Unsure of whether the bombs sent to Psychlo detonated, Jonnie
   opposes a longtime rival from his own clan, Brown Limper Staffor, who
   is seeking to wrest control of Earth for himself. Unwittingly used by
   Terl to advance his own plans, Brown Limper nearly succeeds after
   gaining assistance from a group of malevolent mercenaries from southern
   Africa called the Brigantes, and their leader General Snith. But Brown
   Limper is killed by Terl just before the Psychlo's teleportation, and
   the Brigantes are defeated.

   It is discovered that all Psychlos have a deep brain stimulation device
   implanted in their brains to make them controllable. Meant to make work
   pleasant for them, the device promotes extreme sadism in the males,
   causing them to attack any non-Psychlo who shows interest in Psychlo
   mathematics and teleportation. If the Psychlos are unsuccessful in
   killing their intended victims, the device compels them to commit
   suicide. Removal of this device cures the handful of remaining Psychlos
   on Earth.

   With the Earth being threatened by other alien races looking for
   restitution because they had suffered under the harsh rule of the
   Psychlos, Jonnie opposes a race of intergalactic bankers seeking to
   repossess the Earth for unpaid debts. The security of and independence
   of humanity once again threatened, Jonnie discovers that the dirty
   nukes sent with the intent of destroying the capital city on Psychlo
   instead started a chain reaction which reached into the planet's core
   due to over-mining, causing the planet to explode and transform into a
   star. Jonnie also discovers that other Psychlo facilities scattered
   about the multiple universes were destroyed by their own reliance on
   teleportation as they performed their scheduled teleportation
   shipments, and instead, brought back radioactive solar matter. This
   holocaust killed every single Psychlo in the multiple universes except
   for the handful remaining on Earth. Once Jonnie finds out that all
   female Psychlos who leave the homeworld are sterilized to prevent
   off-world births, he realizes that the Psychlos on Earth will not be
   able to reproduce, and that eventually the Psychlo race will become
   extinct.

   Jonnie discovers a way to prevent the repossession of Earth via
   contracts Terl had signed with Brown Limper Staffor. The Psychlo had
   thought it would be amusing to make Staffor believe he was the legal
   owner of Earth as well as all Psychlo possessions across the multiple
   universes, by signing a contract that stated as much before his final
   teleportation to Planet Psychlo. Terl had no way of knowing he was
   about to die, along with almost his entire race, with the destruction
   of his homeworld. Once planet Psychlo was destroyed, Terl was the
   highest ranking member of the Intergalactic Mining Company left alive,
   and his signature on Staffor's contract became legal, which meant that
   Jonnie, as the recognized leader of Earth, and with the death of Brown
   Limper, now owned what was left of the entire Psychlo empire. Using
   these contracts, the Earth Planetary Bank pays off all debts to the
   intergalactic bankers.

   Jonnie however is still perplexed by Psychlo mathematics. With the help
   of an aged Psychlo, he learns about Psychlos using a cipher system as
   well as dummy equations to make their mathematics unsolvable. At the
   same time, he also discovers how the Psychlos protected their
   teleportation technology in their local equipment, and records the
   circuits for future use. Using the existing teleportation console,
   Jonnie is able to bring back breathe-gas from a planet in the Psychlo
   star system that was never officially recorded. With the Psychlo math
   and the circuits, Earth begins to manufacture teleportation equipment,
   sold to numerous planetary systems via the intergalactic bankers. At
   the same time, Jonnie uses the Earth's newly acquired wealth to buy
   impenetrable force fields and automated orbiting defense platforms to
   protect the Earth from future threats.

   With the Earth secure and the human population growing and learning
   about its true history, Jonnie gives ownership of the Earth back to its
   people. A few years later, Jonnie and Chrissie are married and have a
   son and a daughter. With human civilization being rebuilt and thriving,
   Jonnie and Chrissie take their children and leave for an isolated part
   of the world to train them in the old ways of survival, and to live out
   the rest of their lives in peace. But, after a year, their friends find
   them and implore them to return to civilization, which Jonnie
   reluctantly agrees to. Years later, frustrated with unending fame and
   life away from nature, a middle-aged Jonnie takes some supplies and
   quietly slips away, never to be seen again. He becomes a figure of
   legend.
