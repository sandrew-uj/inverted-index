   Ijon Tichy is sent to the Eighth World Futurological Congress in Costa
   Rica^[1] by professor Tarantoga. The conference is set to focus on the
   world's overpopulation crisis and ways of dealing with it. It is held
   at the Costa Rica Hilton in Nounas, which is 164 stories tall. Lem is
   fiercely satirical from the start, and absurdities abound at the Hilton
   with its guaranteed "BOMB-FREE" rooms and the extravagances of Tichy's
   suite, which include a palm grove and an "all-girl orchestra [that]
   played Bach while performing a cleverly choreographed striptease".

   The conference itself is no less absurd. Papers and presenters are too
   numerous to allow for full presentations. Instead, papers are
   distributed in hard copy and speakers call out paragraph numbers to
   call attention to their most salient points.

   In the middle of his first night at the conference, Tichy drinks some
   tap water in his hotel room, and his wild hallucinogenic trip begins,
   though it never becomes any more or less absurd than the brief glimpse
   of reality Lem presents in the beginning of the book (if indeed the
   congress is meant to be reality). He realizes the next day that the
   government has drugged the public water supply with "benignimizers", a
   drug that makes the victim helplessly benevolent. Events spiral out of
   control at the Hilton, which was already so chaotic that charred
   corpses from bombing attacks would be covered with tarps where they lay
   while guests went about their business.

   The government ends up bombing the hotel, and Tichy escapes into the
   sewer, where rats walk around on their hind legs. Tichy is evacuated
   from the scene by the military: first he escapes by jetpack, only to
   realise he is hallucinating (falling in the sewer water to find he
   never left). After returning to reality, he is rescued again and this
   time evacuated by helicopter, but during his rescue the helicopter
   crashes, and he awakes in the hospital, where he finds that his brain
   has been transplanted into the body of an attractive young black woman.

   Protesters attack the hospital, and Tichy is nearly killed again. This
   time when he wakes up, he finds that he has been transplanted into the
   body of an overweight, red-haired man, however this too is an illusion
   (again, broken when Tichy falls into the sewer water). When the
   military once again arrive to rescue everyone in the sewer Tichy
   refuses to move, believing that it is another illusion. He is then
   found by counter-revolutionaries, who shoot him. Awaking in another
   hospital, Tichy's mental state grows increasingly fragile as he cannot
   distinguish reality from hallucination (giving the staff inane
   nicknames, such as "Hallucinathan" and "Hallucinda"), and the medical
   staff make the decision to freeze him until a time when medicine can
   help his condition.

   He awakes in the year 2039, and at this point, the novel adopts the
   format of a journal that Tichy keeps to chronicle his experience in
   this new world. His future shock is so great that he finds he is being
   introduced to the world in small stages by the medical staff.

   In most regards, this future society is Utopian. Money is no object.
   One can simply go to the bank and request any sum and borrow it
   interest-free. There is no effort made to collect the debt, either, as
   most people take a drug that instills a sense of pride and work-ethic,
   which would disallow defaulting on the debt.

   Tichy learns that there is an inherent bias against defrostees, and
   that there are a great deal of words that he does not understand. Like
   cityspeak, and many other sci-fi futuristic languages, it is a mishmash
   of words with clear enough English roots, though Tichy is mystified by
   it. Also, mood is highly regulated by drugs. Tichy gets involved with a
   woman, and during an argument, she deliberately takes a drug called
   recriminol to make her more combative, which prolongs the tiff.

   Following their break-up, Tichy becomes deeply disillusioned with the
   "psychem" mentality, wherein drugs regulate every waking moment of the
   day. He resolves to stop taking any drugs and confides to his friend,
   professor Trottelreiner, that he can't stand this new world.
   Trottelreiner explains that the everyday drugs that Tichy is tired of
   are only the tip of the iceberg. Narcotics and hallucinogens are
   trifles compared to "mascons", which are so powerful that they mask
   whole swaths of reality.

   Trottelreiner explains, "mascon" derives from mask, masquerade,
   mascara: "By introducing properly prepared mascons to the brain, one
   can mask any object in the outside world behind a fictitious
   image--superimposed--and with such dexterity, that the psychemasconated
   subject cannot tell which of his perceptions have been altered, and
   which have not. If but for a single instant you could see this world of
   ours the way it really is--undoctored, unadulterated, uncensored--you
   would drop in your tracks!"

   The professor then gives Tichy a flask of "up'n'at'm, one of the
   vigilanimides, a powerful countersomniac and antipsychem agent. A
   derivative of dimethylethylhexabutylpeptopeyotine". With his first
   sniff of up'n'at'm, Tichy watches as the gilded surroundings of the
   five-star restaurant they are in evaporates into a dingy concrete
   bunker, and his stuffed pheasant turns into "the most unappetizing
   gray-brown gruel, which stuck in globs to my tin -- no longer silver --
   fork".

   But this first dose is just the beginning of Tichy's journey. He sees
   that people do not drive cars or ride in elevators, but they run in the
   streets and climb the walls of empty elevator shafts, which explains
   why everyone in this new world is so out of breath. Robots whip people
   in the street and protect order. Through successive doses of more and
   more powerful types of up'n'at'm, Tichy sees increasingly horrible
   visions of the world, climaxing in a frozen horrorscape where people
   sleep blissfully in the snow, and the police robots are revealed to be
   people who are convinced that they are robots. The frozen state of the
   world explains why he has always found the new world to be so cold.

   In a state of panic, Tichy realizes that he is "no longer safely inside
   the illusion, but shipwrecked in reality", and he desperately seeks the
   seat of power. He ascends in a skyscraper to encounter his acquaintance
   George P. Symington Esquire, who sits in a modest office and explains
   to Tichy that he and a few others employ mascons as a way of
   maintaining order:

          "The year is 2098 ... with 69 billion inhabitants legally
          registered and approximately another 26 billion in hiding. The
          average annual temperature has fallen four degrees. In fifteen
          or twenty years there will be glaciers here. We have no way of
          averting or halting their advance -- we can only keep them
          secret."
          "I always thought there would be ice in hell," I said.

   Tichy realizes his only course of action and tackles Symington, pushing
   them both out of the window. They plummet to the earth, but instead of
   colliding with the frozen ground, Tichy splashes into the black,
   stinking waters of the sewer beneath the Costa Rica Hilton, revealing
   that his suspicions were right all along: the whole future world he
   experienced was an illusion. He realizes that it is now the second day
   of the Eighth World Futurological Congress.
