   A soldier (Elizabeth Montgomery) wearing a tattered uniform stumbles
   into a deserted city. She looks into some of the shop windows before
   spying what was a restaurant. She finds a can of chicken in the
   kitchen, but before she can open it, a man (Charles Bronson) wearing a
   worn uniform walks in. She attacks him. The man knocks her out and
   begins to ravenously eat the chicken.

   He leaves the restaurant and goes to a newsstand. A newspaper reveals
   that the city was evacuated during the war. He returns to the kitchen
   and wakes the woman by dumping a pot of water on her face. He says
   there is no reason to fight anymore, as there are no more armies, only
   tattered rags that once resembled uniforms. He says that she can have
   the leftover chicken, but eventually realizes that she cannot
   understand him and departs. The woman is wary, but eats the chicken.

   She then follows him into a barber shop and watches as he shaves. He
   tosses a bar of soap to her, then a towel, which she uses to wash her
   dirty face. They wander down the street, coming to a movie theater. He
   stares at a poster for a wartime romance film and turns to smile at
   her. They find the skeletal remains of soldiers at the theater entrance
   and suddenly grab the rifles of the dead owners, simultaneously aiming
   at each other.

   After a tense moment, the man turns and walks away, slinging his weapon
   over his shoulder. The woman follows him, and the two walk along the
   city street. They stop in front of a store with a dress in the smashed
   display window and she mutters "pryekrasnyy" (prekrasnyj), the Russian
   word for "beautiful". He hands the dress to her and tells her to go and
   put it on.

   She enters the building next to the department store, which turns out
   to be a recruiting office. As she prepares to change into the dress,
   she notices the jingoistic enlistment posters on the wall. She grabs
   her rifle, exits the office and angrily shoots at him twice, but
   misses. The man gets up, looks at her incredulously, and walks away. As
   night falls, she returns to the barber shop to sleep in the barber's
   chair, gun in her arms, staring at the dress.

   The next morning, the man has changed out of his uniform into a
   makeshift suit and has found two jars of peaches. He sees the woman
   waiting, peeking at him from behind a truck in the street below. He
   yells at her to leave, to "take your war to more suitable companions".
   She emerges from behind the truck wearing the dress. He tosses one of
   the jars to her and says "pryekrasnyy". She smiles, and they walk away
   together.
