   The game is set in the United States in the last quarter of the 19th
   century. The canonical year for the first edition of Deadlands is 1876.
   A later supplement, Tales o' Terror, advances the game's backstory and
   metaplot ahead one year, to 1877. The second edition of Deadlands uses
   the updated backstory of 1877 as the canonical starting point.
   Deadlands: Reloaded further updates the backstory and advances the
   canonical starting point to 1879.

   The basic rules provide for characters and settings that could be
   expected to appear in the "Wild West" genre of movies and pulp fiction,
   and most of the in-game action is presumed to occur in the wild
   frontiers of the American West, or in barely tamed frontier towns like
   Tombstone, Arizona or Dodge City, Kansas. However, later supplements
   expanded the in-game adventuring area to include places such as the
   Deep South, the Mississippi River, Mexico, and the Northeastern United
   States. These supplements often provide for adventures set in urban
   areas such as New Orleans, New York City, or Boston.

   The canonical, basic setting is referred to as the "Weird West" due to
   the juxtaposition of the Western setting with the horrific and
   fantastical elements of the game. The history of the Weird West is
   identical to real-world history, up until July 3, 1863. On this date in
   the game, a group of American Indians from various tribes, led by a
   Sioux shaman known as "Raven," performed a ritual in an effort to drive
   out the European settlers. This ritual created a conduit to a spiritual
   realm populated by powerful malicious entities known as the
   "Reckoners." The events surrounding and immediately subsequent to
   Raven's ritual is known as "The Reckoning."

   The Reckoners feed on negative emotions, particularly fear. Sufficient
   levels of fear in the population of a given location allow the
   Reckoners to begin subtly altering the environment of that location:
   the sun shines a little less brightly, trees become stunted and "evil"
   looking, rock formations take on the appearance of corpses or monsters,
   and so on. The more powerful the fear, the greater the environmental
   changes.

   The ultimate goal of the Reckoners is to turn the entire Earth into an
   evil, haunted wasteland -- literally a Hell on Earth. However, the
   Reckoners cannot directly enter Earth's realm unless the overall fear
   level of the entire planet becomes sufficiently high. To this end, they
   use their powers to create monsters, madmen, zombies, and other
   creatures and villains that will sow fear and terror throughout the
   land.

   The first instance of this occurred on July 4, 1863, at the site of the
   Battle of Gettysburg that had just ended; dead soldiers from both sides
   of the conflict rose from the battlefield and began indiscriminately
   attacking the surviving soldiers and civilians. Since then, undead
   gunslingers, hostile Indian spirits, strange cults, and deadly
   creatures have begun terrorizing the world. The American Civil War
   drags on thanks to the machinations of the Reckoners, and the country
   remains divided into U.S. and Confederate sections along with "disputed
   territories." Federal agents and Texas Rangers struggle to deal with
   the eldritch menaces while hiding the awful truth from the general
   public. Seismic upheavals have pushed much of California into the
   ocean, creating a badlands area known as "the Great Maze." In the Great
   Maze, miners discover "ghost rock," a mineral that burns hotter and
   longer than coal and is used as the basis for most Deadlands technology
   as well as alchemical potions and semi-magical materials.

   The unleashing of the Reckoners has had a number of important side
   effects. Magic was revealed to be real, although it involves
   challenging otherworldly spirits, "manitous", in contests that are
   either viewed as a negotiation or a test of will. These same manitous
   can possess a recently deceased body and reanimate it, creating a
   "Harrowed". Harrowed beings are sometimes under the control of the
   spirit (which uses the opportunity to spread fear) and sometimes under
   the control of the deceased being. Scientific progress rapidly advances
   as the Reckoners support experimental designs that normally would not
   work. This progress drives the technological level of Deadlands from
   historical levels to a "steampunk" setting.

   Players take on the role of various mundane or arcane character types,
   including Gunfighters, Lawmen (such as U.S. Marshals or local
   sheriffs), Hucksters (magic users), Shamans, Blessed (those of faith),
   and Mad Scientists in an attempt to learn about the Reckoning and the
   mysterious beings behind it.
