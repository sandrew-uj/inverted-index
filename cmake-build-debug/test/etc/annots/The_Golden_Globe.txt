   The Golden Globe takes place in Varley's "Eight Worlds" universe. The
   solar system has been colonized by human refugees fleeing aliens (known
   as "the Invaders"). Earth and Jupiter are off-limits to humanity, but
   Earth's moon and the other planets and moons of the solar system have
   all become populated. There are also minor colonies set in the Oort
   cloud beyond the solar system itself. The Golden Globe story is told
   initially from a first person perspective, but a substantial portion of
   the book comes in the form of extended flashbacks.

   The Golden Globe in question is Luna, Earth's moon and the most heavily
   inhabited world in the solar system since the Invaders obliterated
   human civilization on Earth.

   The novel begins as a first person account of Valentine's adventures in
   the outer worlds of the solar system as he attempts to make his way to
   Luna in order to play King Lear in an upcoming production. Valentine is
   a consummate actor and a skilled con man. It is by exercising the
   latter skill that he runs afoul of the Charonese Mafia, personified by
   the cold-blooded and nigh-unkillable assassin Isambard Comfort.

   The story is punctuated by several extended flashback sequences in
   which we learn that Valentine's father, a supremely egotistical and
   domineering stage actor, has groomed his son almost from birth to
   follow in his footsteps. It is Valentine, Sr.'s megalomania and
   obsession with the stage that sets the tone for much of the flashback
   material.

   While his father is auditioning for a role and has left young Kenneth
   sitting in a waiting room, Valentine wanders a little and gets swept up
   to audition for a part in a new children's adventure show called
   "Sparky and His Gang" and is cast in the lead role. As the show becomes
   increasingly popular, Valentine, Sr. interferes more and more, and
   becomes more difficult for his son and the producers of the show to
   deal with.

   We learn in these flashback segments that Valentine, Sr. subjects his
   son to monstrous and potentially fatal child abuse. This is framed
   quite realistically and Valentine, Sr. is apparently aware of but
   unable to control his nearly homicidal rage.

   At times, both in the main story and in flashback, Valentine meets with
   a mysterious character named Elwood. It is ambiguous in the narrative
   exactly what type of being Elwood is; however, as the novel progresses,
   both in the present and in flashback, the character is more fully
   identified as Elwood P. Dowd and said to look very much like actor
   James Stewart, who played a character of the same name in Harvey.

   Though the reader gradually comes to believe Elwood is a figment of
   Valentine's imagination, the climactic confrontation between Valentine
   and his father blurs this distinction considerably. However, Valentine
   narrates his own flashbacks for the reader, and as much as states that
   he may be an unreliable narrator.

   It is revealed in both the main and flashback storylines that Valentine
   killed (or believed himself to have killed) his father. In the main
   storyline, he is, after 70 years on the run, eventually put on trial
   for this murder, and his case is weighed by the Central Computer of
   Luna. Genetic tests reveal that Valentine is actually a clone of his
   father (further evidence of the maniacal self-absorption of the
   father). The fact that cloning was illegal at the time of his father's
   murder causes the Central Computer to declare that no crime was
   committed, as the only legal remedy in place at the time was for one
   clone or the other to be destroyed.

   At the conclusion of the novel, Valentine says that he has reclaimed
   his fortune (long inaccessible to him during his life on the run) and
   thrown in his lot with the Heinleiners, a reclusive group of
   libertarian idealists who are building a starship and planning a voyage
   to the stars.
