   Tod Hackett is the novel's protagonist. He moves from the east coast to
   Hollywood, California in search of inspiration for his next painting.
   The novel is set in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Most of the
   characters exist at the fringes of the Hollywood film industry, but
   Hollywood is merely the backdrop for Tod Hackett's revelation. Tod is
   employed by a Hollywood studio "to learn set and costume
   designing." During his spare time, Tod sketches scenes he observes
   on large production sets and studio back lots. The novel details Tod's
   observation of the filming of the Battle of Waterloo. His goal is to
   find inspiration for the picture he is getting ready to begin, a work
   titled "The Burning of Los Angeles."

   Tod falls in love with Faye Greener, an aspiring starlet who lives
   nearby but Faye only loves men that are good looking or have wealth.
   Tod is simply a "good-hearted man," the kind Faye likes. He
   imagines that loving her would compare to jumping from a skyscraper and
   screaming to the ground. Tod wants to "throw himself , no
   matter what the cost." Throughout the novel, Tod fantasizes about
   having a sexual encounter with Faye as an act of rape. Every time he
   imagines raping her, reality interrupts his fantasy before he can
   complete the act. Scenes are interrupted prior to their climax
   frequently throughout the novel. A patron jokes that it is "the old
   teaser routine," when a film viewing at Mrs. Jenning's parlor ends
   unexpectedly due to technical difficulties.

   Between his work at the studio and his introduction to Faye's friends,
   Tod interacts with numerous Hollywood hangers-on. Characters like Abe
   Kusich, the dwarf; Claude Estee, the successful screenwriter; and Earle
   Shoop, the fake California cowboy, all of whom have difficulty changing
   their personas from the characters they play to who they are. As a
   result, there is a clear sense of acting that spills beyond the
   confines of Hollywood studios, into the streets of Los Angeles.

   Shortly after moving into a neighborhood in the valley, Tod befriends
   Homer Simpson, a simple-minded bookkeeper from Iowa who moved to
   California for health reasons. Homer Simpson's "unruly hands" operate
   independently from his body, and their movements are often
   mechanical. "They demanded special attention, had always demanded
   it." When Homer attempts to escape California he is distracted not
   only by the crowd but his inability to leave the street despite Tod's
   help and insistent encouragement. Young neighbor Adore Loomis finds
   Homer and torments him until Homer lashes out against the boy. The
   novel's climactic riot ensues and the chaos over the latest Hollywood
   premiere turns violent outside Mr. Khan's Pleasure Dome. Tod vividly
   revises "The Burning of Los Angeles" in his mind, while being pushed
   around in the waves of the riot. The final scene plays out,
   uninterrupted. The conclusion of the novel can be read as a moment of
   enlightenment and mental clarity for the artist, or a complete "mental
   breakdown" and Tod's "incorporation into the mechanized, modern world
   of Los Angeles."
