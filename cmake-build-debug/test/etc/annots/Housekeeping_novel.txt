   Ruthie narrates the story of how she and her younger sister Lucille are
   raised by a succession of relatives in the fictional town of
   Fingerbone, Idaho (some details are similar to Robinson's hometown,
   Sandpoint, Idaho, particularly the presence of a major rail bridge and
   direct rail links to Spokane and Montana). Eventually their aunt Sylvie
   (who has been living as a transient) comes to take care of them. At
   first the three are a close knit group, but as Lucille grows up she
   comes to dislike their eccentric lifestyle and moves out. When Ruthie's
   well-being is questioned by the courts, Sylvie returns to life on the
   road and takes Ruthie with her.

   The novel treats the subject of housekeeping, not only in the domestic
   sense of cleaning, but in the larger sense of keeping a spiritual home
   for one's self and family in the face of loss, for the girls experience
   a series of abandonments as they come of age.

   The novel is narrated by Ruth, from the perspective of the transparent
   eyeball. This narration style was used by the transcendentalist authors
   that influenced Robinson, including Ralph Waldo Emerson.
