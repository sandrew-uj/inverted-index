   The legends were first printed during 1837 as a regular series in the
   magazine Bentley's Miscellany and later in New Monthly Magazine.
   They proved immensely popular and were compiled into books published in
   1840, 1842 and 1847 by Richard Bentley. They remained popular during
   the 19th century, when they ran through many editions. They were
   illustrated by artists including John Leech, George Cruikshank, John
   Tenniel, and Arthur Rackham (1898 edition).

   As a priest of the Chapel Royal, with a private income, Barham was
   not troubled with strenuous duties and he had ample time to read and
   compose stories. Although based on real legends and mythology, chiefly
   Kentish, such as the "hand of glory", they are mostly deliberately
   humorous parodies or pastiches of medieval folklore and poetry.

   The best-known poem of the collection is "The Jackdaw of Rheims",
   about a jackdaw, who steals a cardinal's ring, and is made a saint. The
   village pub of Denton was renamed "The Jackdaw Inn" in 1963, after the
   story. The collection also contains one of the earliest transcriptions
   of the song "A Franklyn's Dogge", an early version of the modern
   children's song "Bingo". Barham introduced the collection with the
   grandiose statement that "The World, according to the best geographers,
   is divided into Europe, Asia, Africa, America and Romney Marsh".
