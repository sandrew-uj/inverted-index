   Actor Matt Damon, who portrays Jason Bourne in the film series

   The Jason Bourne novels were adapted into a series of films - The
   Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), The Bourne
   Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016).
   The films retain the titles and some base elements but otherwise
   feature different plots independent of the novels. In these films,
   Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon.

   Bourne does not appear in The Bourne Legacy, with the exception of his
   picture being featured in the film as well as brief discussions of how
   he's caused problems to the organization he worked for. As a result,
   the film focuses on the fallout in the intelligence community from
   Bourne's actions in Ultimatum. Legacy features Jeremy Renner as Aaron
   Cross, an operative in a different clandestine program evolved from
   Treadstone.
