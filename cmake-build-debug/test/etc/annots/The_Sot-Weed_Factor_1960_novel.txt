   The novel is a satirical epic of the colonization of Maryland based on
   the life of an actual poet, Ebenezer Cooke, who wrote a poem of the
   same title. The Sot-Weed Factor is what Northrop Frye called an
   anatomy--a large, loosely structured work, with
   digressions, distractions, stories within stories, and lists (such as a
   lengthy exchange of insulting terms by two prostitutes). The
   fictional Ebenezer Cooke (repeatedly described as "poet and virgin") is
   a Candide-like innocent who sets out to write a heroic epic, becomes
   disillusioned and ends up writing a biting satire.

   The novel is set in the 1680s and 90s in London and on the eastern
   shore of the colony of Maryland. It tells the story of an English poet
   named Ebenezer Cooke who is given the title "Poet Laureate of Maryland"
   by Charles Calvert. He undergoes many adventures on his journey to
   Maryland and while in Maryland, all the while striving to preserve his
   innocence (i.e. his virginity). The book takes its title from the grand
   poem that Cooke composes throughout the story, which was originally
   intended to sing the praises of Maryland, but ends up being a biting
   satire based on his disillusioning experiences.

   Ebenezer Cooke is the son of Andrew Cooke, an English merchant who owns
   a tobacco (or 'sot-weed') plantation at the settlement of Malden in the
   colony of Maryland. Along with his twin sister Anna, Ebenezer is
   tutored privately by a young man named Henry Burlingame III. Later,
   while Ebenezer is studying at Cambridge University, he is reunited with
   Henry who reveals his past life as an orphan, travelling musician and
   seaman. Henry recounts a tale of saving a mother and daughter from
   pirates, and then persuades Ebenezer to travel to London, where
   Ebenezer decides that his true vocation is to be a poet.

   While ill, Andrew Cooke grants power of attorney to Ebenezer and
   reveals that, after the death of their mother, Ebenezer and Anna were
   nursed by a woman named Roxanne Edouarde.

   In London, Ebenezer declares his love for the prostitute Joan Toast,
   but refuses to pay her fee, and confesses to being a virgin. Joan's
   pimp and lover, John McEvoy, subsequently informs Andrew that Ebenezer
   has been leading a dissolute life, so Andrew sends Ebenezer and a
   servant, Bertrand Burton, to Maryland. From devotion to Joan, Ebenezer
   swears to remain a virgin. Before his departure, Ebenezer visits
   Charles Calvert, Lord Baltimore, who is the Governor of Maryland, and
   offers his services as a Poet Laureate of the colony. Calvert is
   bemused, but grants the commission. Ebenezer decides to write an epic
   poem entitled "Marylandiad".

   On the coach to Plymouth, Ebenzer encounters one Peter Sayer, who is
   really Henry in disguise. Henry reveals that, while trying to ascertain
   his true identity, he has become embroiled in the politics of Maryland,
   but has discovered that he was adopted as an infant by one Captain
   Salmon, after being found floating on a raft in Chesapeake Bay. He has
   also obtained part of a journal which reveals that his grandfather,
   Henry Burlingame I, took part in an expedition led by Captain John
   Smith that was attacked by Indians. In order to save his own life, and
   that of Burlingame, Smith undergoes a sexual trial with Pocahontas, the
   daughter of the Indian chief Powhatans. At this point, the journal
   breaks off, and Henry explains that he is searching for the remaining
   sections of the document.

   In Plymouth, Henry leaves Ebenezer, who is terrified by a sinister pair
   of seamen called Slye and Scurry who declare that they are pursuing a
   man by the name of Ebenezer Cooke. Ebenezer boards his ship, the
   Poseidon, only to find that his identity has been assumed by Bertrand,
   who is fleeing London because of an affair with a married woman. In
   order to escape detection, Ebenezer agrees to exchange places with
   Bertrand on the voyage. Bertrand then loses Ebenezer's savings by
   gambling with the Reverend Tubman and a young woman named Lucy
   Rowbotham. The Poseidon is captured by pirates led by a Captain Pound,
   and Ebenezer and Bertrand are taken on board their ship, which then
   attacks another ship, the Cyprian, which is loaded with prostitutes.
   The pirates rape the female passengers, and Ebenezer is tempted to rape
   a woman who reminds him of Joan. Captain Pound has Ebenezer and
   Bertrand thrown overboard, telling them that he has heard that someone
   by the name of Ebenezer Cooke has already arrived in Maryland.

   Expecting to drown, Bertrand tells Ebenezer that he has wagered away to
   Tubman the whole of the Malden estate. The pair make it to shore where
   they free a bound black man named Drepacca, and treat the wounds of an
   elderly Indian chief named Quassapelagh. They meet Susan Warren, a
   female swineherd who also reminds Ebenezer of Joan. Susan claims that
   she has been debased by Captain William Mitchell, and that she is
   acquainted with Joan. Ebenezer meets both Captain Mitchell and his son
   Tim, who turns out to be Henry Burlingame III in another disguise.
   Ebenezer and Henry visit Father Smith, a Jesuit priest who owns part of
   the journal sought by Henry. Smith relates how he was told by an Indian
   named Charley Mattasin the tale of Father Fitzmaurice, a missionary who
   fathered three children on Indian women of the same tribe. The journal
   gives further details of the capture of Captain Smith and Henry's
   grandfather, but in order to discover more, Henry turns next to
   locating a cooper by the name of William Smith.

   At the next settlement, Ebenezer witnesses a chaotic outdoor court in
   session. He hears how William Smith was once indentured to a man named
   Ben Spurdance and how Spurdance tried to swindle Smith out of his share
   of land upon expiry of his indenture. The court is about to find in
   favour of Spurdance, but an outraged Ebenezer insists that the court
   punish Spurdance by signing the rights to Spurdance's land over to
   Smith. The judge agrees and gets Ebenezer to sign a document, whereupon
   Ebenezer discovers that Spurdance is the overseer of Malden, and that
   his father's estate has now passed to Smith. Ebenezer meets Mary
   Mungummory, a prostitute who was once the lover of the Indian Charley
   Mattasin. He hears that John McEvoy has travelled to Maryland in search
   of Joan Toast, and meets Thomas Tayhoe, a man who has been indentured
   to William Smith because of trickery on the part of McEvoy. Ebenezer
   offers to exchange places with Tayhoe, and this plan is accepted by
   Smith on the condition that Ebenezer marries Susan Warren. After the
   marriage, Susan reveals that she is really Joan Toast.

   Upon hearing that his father is due to arrive at Malden, Ebenezer flees
   in the company of one Nicholas Lowe, who turns out to be Henry in yet
   another disguise. Henry reveals that Anna is in Maryland and Ebenezer
   resolves to find her. Upon arrival in the town of St Mary's, Ebenezer
   encounters Bertrand, who has again been posing as Ebenezer. Bertrand
   has become the lover of Lucy Rowbotham, who had married the Reverend
   Tubman only to discover that Tubman was already married. Because of the
   wagers made on board of the Poseidon, Tubman and Lucy both believe they
   have a claim on Malden.

   After deciding to return to Malden, Ebenezer and Bertrand commission a
   boat skippered by Captain Cairn. During a storm, they shelter upon
   Bloodsworth Island, where they are captured by a community of rogue
   slaves and rebellious Indians that is dedicated to waging war against
   white men. Another prisoner is John McEvoy. They meet Drepacca and
   Quassapelagh, but are threatened with execution by Chicamec, king of
   the Ahatchwoop people. Ebenezer mentions the name of Henry Burlingame,
   whereupon Chicamec suspends their execution. Ebenezer is allowed to
   read a journal that gives a further account of the adventures of John
   Smith and Henry Burlingame I. The journal relates how Burlingame became
   chief of the Ahatchwoops by winning an eating contest. Furthermore,
   Burlingame--who has a remarkably small penis--uses Smith's egg-plant
   recipe in order to impregnate the wife he marries as chief. The child
   is Chicamec himself, who then takes as his bride a young woman who is
   the descendant of Father Fitzmaurice. He has three sons; one of whom is
   white-skinned; another golden skinned; and a third dark-skinned. The
   first he names Henry Burlingame III and places on a raft. The second
   and third, Chicamec states, fell in love with white women, and betrayed
   the Ahatchwoops. Ebenezer calculates that the dark-skinned son became
   Charley Mattasin, who loved Mary Mungummory and was executed for
   murder.

   Ebenezer strikes a deal with Chicamec whereby, after leaving Bertrand
   and Captain Cairn as hostages, he will attempt to trace Chicamec's
   surviving sons and bring them to Bloodsworth Island. After leaving the
   island, they encounter Mary who, along with the trapper Harvey
   Russecks, explains that a golden-skinned Indian by the name of Billy
   Rumbly is living with a white English woman. They then encounter
   Harvey's brother, Harry, a crooked and violent miller who is jealous of
   his wife, Roxanne, and daughter, Henrietta. McEvoy plays a trick on
   Harry that results in Harry becoming gravely injured. It transpires
   that Roxanne and Henrietta are the mother and daughter who were saved
   from the clutches of pirates by Henry years earlier. Billy Rumbly
   arrives and is astonished to hear that his father and lost brother are
   still alive, but is reluctant to take steps to prevent the imminent
   conflict with the Indians and slaves. Rumbly leads Ebenezer to his
   cabin where it transpires that Rumbly's partner is Anna. After hearing
   of Anna's affection for Henry, Rumbly decides to return to Bloodsworth
   Island, accompanied by McEvoy. Ebenezer and Anna discover that Roxanne
   is their former nurse and that Henrietta is their half-sister.

   McEvoy returns with Bertrand and Captain Cairn but claims that Rumbly
   has now sided with the Indians and slaves. Ebenezer and Anna decide to
   return to Malden along with McEvoy, Henrietta, Bertrand and Roxanne.
   Their boat is seized by the pirate Ben Avery and the men forced to swim
   to shore. The women are freed after Ben Avery recognizes Roxanne as a
   former lover. At Malden, the ownership of the Cooke estate is decided
   by a court presided over by Governor Nicholson. The claim by Lucy
   Rowbotham and her father are rejected. By way of a legal nicety, Malden
   passes back to the Cooke family because of Joan Toast's marriage to
   Ebenzer. William Smith and his lawyer Sowter are threatened with
   imprisonment, but are released after presenting Henry with more of the
   journal that tells of his ancestor's fate. Together with a fragment
   held by Joan, this reveals the egg-plant recipe by which Smith and
   Burlingame increased their penis size and enabled them to fulfil their
   sexual challenges.

   Ebenezer and Joan consummate their marriage, and Joan falls pregnant.
   Burlingame leaves for Bloodsworth Island in order to quell the
   rebellion. He returns in Indian guise with the intention of marrying
   Anna but leaves once more and does not return. Anna falls pregnant, but
   is saved from disgrace when Joan and her child die in childbirth and
   Anna's child is reared as Ebenezer's.
