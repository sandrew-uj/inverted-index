   Fleeing her old life, Rosemary Harper joins the multi-species crew of
   the Wayfarer as a file clerk, and follows them on their various
   missions throughout the galaxy. The novel concerns itself with
   character development rather than adventure. Each member of the crew
   has a story that unfolds, or a crisis to face. They encounter several
   alien environments on the slow path to their destination. At the end,
   the ship is damaged by hostile aliens, precipitating changes in the
   relationships between the characters, setting them on new paths.
