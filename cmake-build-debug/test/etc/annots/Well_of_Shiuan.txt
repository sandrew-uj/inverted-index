   Mija Jherun, a fey seventeen-year-old peasant woman, lives in a world
   inexorably being overwhelmed by the sea. One day, after looting a
   barrow, the tomb of a young warrior-king, she is chased by an armored
   man on horseback back to her village. He breaks into the poor home she
   shares with her family, helps himself to some food, and asks if anyone
   has seen a pale woman on a grey horse. After repulsing an attack by the
   men of the village, he departs for Shiuan, a richer land ruled by the
   khal, another race that is enough like humans to successfully
   interbreed.

   Jherun, yearning for a less bleak future than marrying the thuggish
   Fwar, runs after him. Instead of finding him, she stumbles upon his
   mortal enemies: his cousin, Nhi Vanye, and Vanye's lord, Morgaine, the
   pale woman.

   They inform her that Chya Roh's body had been taken over by an evil
   creature who had extended his life countless times by this means. He
   had betrayed Morgaine and sent ten thousand men to their doom a century
   before. Fleeing her, he had passed through a Gate from Vanye's world to
   this one, closing the passageway forever, but not quickly enough to
   prevent Morgaine and Vanye from following.

   Jherun knows of two Gates, which she calls Wells. The newcomers had
   emerged from one; the other is in Shiuan. Morgaine's mission is to
   travel from world to world, closing their Gates permanently, as they
   can (and have in the past) destroyed whole civilizations when their
   immense power is misused. She is the last survivor of a band of one
   hundred sent for that purpose. Vanye is a chance-met warrior, bound to
   obey her initially by his stubborn sense of honor and later for other
   reasons.

   As they travel towards Shiuan, it begins to rain heavily. They become
   separated when Vanye is knocked off his horse by an uprooted tree
   carried by the rapidly rising, onrushing water. He finds Jherun, but
   not Morgaine. Knowing that Morgaine will make for the Well of Shiuan,
   he heads there also, accompanied by Jherun.

   Along the way, Jherun persuades him to seek food and shelter at the
   fortress of Ohtij-in, held by half-breed khal. This proves to be a
   grave mistake, as Roh had preceded him there. He treats Vanye well,
   claiming that the Roh Vanye knew still coexists with his "murderer";
   Vanye is uncertain and does not kill him when Roh deliberately gives
   him the opportunity.

   Roh has promised the khal a way out of their dying world. The old lord,
   Bydarra, is skeptical, but his ruthless son Hetharu is more receptive.
   He murders his own father and puts the blame on Vanye. He assembles his
   forces and heads off to the Gate with Roh. Vanye is left behind, a
   prisoner of Hetharu's brother Kithan, but is rescued by Morgaine and an
   army she has recruited from Jherun's people and their neighbors, the
   marshlanders.

   However, when they learn what Morgaine intends, they turn on her,
   forcing her to kill many with her advanced weapons. Morgaine, Vanye,
   Jherun and Kithan flee on horseback, followed by the mob on foot.

   They reach the control room for the Gate of Shiuan, only to find that
   Roh has locked the controls. He has also left a message: he will allow
   Vanye safe passage through, but not Morgaine. She orders Vanye to go to
   Roh, wait his chance to kill him, and continue on with her mission.
   Knowing that the two of them stand no chance against Roh's army, he
   reluctantly obeys, taking the other two with him. Roh sees through the
   ruse immediately, but still accepts his cousin.

   As they prepare to pass through the Gate, Morgaine attacks with the
   human rabble, with which she has forged an uneasy alliance. In the
   confusion, Vanye fights his way to her, and together they force their
   way through, to continue their quest on yet another world.

   The rest, khal and human alike, follow, save Jherun and Kithan. Then
   the Gate closes.
