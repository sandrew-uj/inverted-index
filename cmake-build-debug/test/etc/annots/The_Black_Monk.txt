   On 28 July 1893 Chekhov informed Alexey Suvorin in a letter that he'd
   just finished "a little novella, just a couple of quires". "Come to
   visit me here, and I'll give it for you to read", he added somewhat
   teasingly. Suvorin suggested that the story should be published in
   Novoye Vremya, but Chekhov declined the offer. Later, upon having read
   the story, Suvorin asked to what extent did it reflect the author's own
   mental condition. "When the writer depicts a sick person it does not
   mean he is sick himself... Just wanted to portray a man suffering from
   delusions of grandeur. The image of a monk riding in the fields came to
   me in a dream, and as I woke up I told about to Misha", Chekhov replied
   in the 25 January 1894 letter.
   Chekhov discarded Max Nordau's ideas on the European intelligentsia's
   spiritual degeneration, but, perhaps inadvertently, quoted fragments
   from his 1892 book Degeneration at least twice in the story.

   According to Mikhail Chekhov, the story in many ways reflected
   Chekhov's experience in Melikhovo. It was here that he became seriously
   engaged in gardening. "Early in the morning he would... come into the
   garden and carefully inspect each tree, each shrub, perhaps to some
   trimming, or just stare at it, inspecting something." Chekhov was
   often visited here by Ignaty Potapenko and Lika Mizinova. "Lika would
   sit at the grand piano and sing the then increasingly popular "Legende
   valaque" by Braga... a song in which a sick, delirious girl hears the
   angels singing and asks her mother to come to the balcony and tell her
   where these sounds might come from ... Anton Pavlovich liked this
   romance's mysticism and fine romanticism. I mention this because it was
   directly linked to the origins of the story The Black Monk," Mikhail
   Chekhov wrote.

   Psychologically those were difficult days for Chekhov, who was
   suffering from anxiety and insomnia. "I would have eagerly flee to you
   in Petersburg, such are my moods, by cholera rages, twenty versts from
   here," he wrote Suvorin on 28 July 1883, complaining about "deadly
   longing for some loneliness" and "horrid psychopathic moods". "...I
   don't think that I suffer from some psychological ailment. It's just
   that the will to live seems to have left me, although I don't think
   it's any kind of sickness, perhaps something transitory and trivial,"
   he wrote to Suvorin in January 1894.

   According to Mikhail Chekhov, "in Melikhovo Anton Pavlovich's nerves
   got completely out of order due to overwork, and he almost lost sleep.
   Once he'd start to fall into drowsiness, some strange force would throw
   him up." It was during one such bad night that he had mental vision
   of a black monk. "It had the immense effect upon my brother, he won't
   be able to shake it off, returned to this monk in conversations from
   time to time and eventually wrote his well-known story about it."

   This was also the time when Chekhov became deeply interested in
   psychiatry and became friends with doctor Vladimir Yakovenko, the
   founder and director of the best Russian psychiatric clinic of its
   time, in Meshcherskoye. "If you want to become a true writer, my
   darling, study psychiatry, this is quite necessary," he was assuring
   Shchepkina-Kupernik, "...in those days when he was writing The Black
   Monk", according to her 1928 memoirs.

   In the summer of 1892 Max Nordau's book Degeneration was widely
   discussed in the Russian press. Chekhov thought little of Nordau's
   ideas, but it might have left some impression upon him, for at
   least twice the Black Monk in his speeches quotes fragments from the
   chapter called "Genius and Crowd".
