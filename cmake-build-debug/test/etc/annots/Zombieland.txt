   Two months have passed since a strain of mad cow disease mutated into
   "mad person disease" that became "mad zombie disease", which overran
   the entire United States (with the infection presumably spreading to
   the rest of the world), turning many Americans into vicious zombies.
   Survivors of the zombie epidemic have learned that growing attached to
   other survivors is not advisable because they could die at any moment,
   so many have taken to using their city of origin as nicknames.

   Lonely college student Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is making his way
   from his college dorm in Austin, Texas, to Columbus, Ohio, to see
   whether his parents are still alive. He encounters Tallahassee (Woody
   Harrelson), another survivor, who is particularly aggressive when
   killing zombies. Though he does not appear to be friendly, Tallahassee
   reluctantly allows Columbus to travel with him. Tallahassee mentions he
   misses his puppy, "Buck" that was killed by zombies, as well as his
   addiction to Twinkies, which he actively tries to find.

   The pair meets Wichita (Emma Stone) and her younger sister Little Rock
   (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters turn out to be con
   artists and trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their
   weapons by pretending that Little Rock is infected by the disease, then
   stealing their Escalade. The two men find a yellow Hummer H2 loaded
   with weapons and go after the sisters. However, the girls spring
   another trap for them and take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun
   back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus intervenes saying
   that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy
   truce between them.

   The sisters reveal that they are going to the Pacific Playland
   amusement park in Los Angeles, an area supposedly free of zombies.
   After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely
   killed, Columbus decides to accompany the others to California. Along
   the trip, Columbus persists in trying to impress and woo Wichita.

   When the group reaches Hollywood, Tallahassee directs them to the
   mansion of Bill Murray. Tallahassee and Wichita meet Murray himself,
   uninfected but disguised as a zombie so he can walk safely around town.
   Murray is killed when Columbus shoots him, mistaking him for a real
   zombie during a practical joke while watching Ghostbusters with Little
   Rock. Columbus realizes during a game of Monopoly that "Buck" was not
   Tallahassee's puppy, but his young son, who had become infected and
   died as a result. Wichita and Columbus become increasingly attracted to
   each other, and Tallahassee bonds with Little Rock, with whom he was
   previously feuding. Despite Wichita's attraction to Columbus, she fears
   attachment and leaves with Little Rock for Pacific Playland the next
   morning. Columbus decides to go after Wichita and convinces Tallahassee
   to join him.

   At Pacific Playland, the sisters activate all the rides and lights so
   they can enjoy the park, only to unwittingly draw the attention of a
   multitude of zombies in the surrounding area. A chase ensues, and just
   as the sisters are trapped on a drop tower ride, Tallahassee and
   Columbus arrive. Tallahassee lures the zombies away, creating a
   distraction for Columbus to get to the tower ride; both using the
   attractions to their advantage. Tallahassee eventually locks himself in
   a game booth, shooting zombies as they arrive. Columbus successfully
   evades and shoots through several zombies to reach the tower and help
   the girls down, but not before changing one of his rules for survival
   to conquer his fear of clowns while facing off against a clown zombie.
   As a show of gratitude, Wichita kisses Columbus and reveals her real
   name: Krista. As the group leaves Pacific Playland, Columbus realizes
   that without relating to other people, one might as well be a zombie
   and that he now has what he has always wanted--a family.

   In closing, Columbus says "And even though life would never be innocent
   again . . . We had hope. We had each other. And without other people,
   well, you might as well be a zombie."
