   Although the character appeared previously in Barrie's book The Little
   White Bird, the play and its novelisation contain the story of Peter
   Pan mythos that is best known. The two versions differ in some details
   of the story, but have much in common. In both versions Peter makes
   night-time calls on the Darlings' house in Bloomsbury,^[4] listening in
   on Mrs. Mary Darling's bedtime stories by the open window. One night
   Peter is spotted and, while trying to escape, he loses his shadow. On
   returning to claim it, Peter wakes Mary's daughter, Wendy Darling.
   Wendy succeeds in re-attaching his shadow to him, and Peter learns that
   she knows many bedtime stories. He invites her to Neverland to be a
   mother to his gang, the Lost Boys, children who were lost in Kensington
   Gardens. Wendy agrees, and her brothers John and Michael go along.

   Their magical flight to Neverland is followed by many adventures. The
   children are blown out of the air by a cannon and Wendy is nearly
   killed by the Lost Boy Tootles. Peter and the Lost Boys build a little
   house for Wendy to live in while she recuperates (a type of structure
   that to this day is called a Wendy house). Soon John and Michael adopt
   the ways of the Lost Boys.

   Peter welcomes Wendy to his underground home, and she immediately
   assumes the role of mother figure. Peter takes the Darlings on several
   adventures, the first truly dangerous one occurring at Mermaids'
   Lagoon. At Mermaids' Lagoon, Peter and the Lost Boys save the princess
   Tiger Lily and become involved in a battle with the pirates, including
   the evil Captain Hook, Peter's nemesis. He is named after the hook that
   replaced his right hand that Peter cut off in a fight. From thereon,
   Hook has been hunted by the crocodile which ate his hand after it fell
   into the water and now wants to eat the rest of him. The crocodile also
   swallowed a ticking clock, so Hook is wary of all ticking sounds. Peter
   is wounded when Hook claws him. He believes he will die, stranded on a
   rock when the tide is rising, but he views death as "an awfully big
   adventure". Luckily, the Neverbird allows him to use her nest as a
   boat, and Peter sails home.

   In gratitude for Peter saving Tiger Lily, her tribe guards his home
   from the next imminent pirate attack. Meanwhile, Wendy begins to fall
   in love with Peter and asks him what kind of feelings he has for her.
   Peter says that he is like her faithful son. One day while telling
   stories to the Lost Boys and her brothers, John and Michael, Wendy
   recalls her parents and then decides to take them back and return to
   England. Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to Peter, Wendy and the boys
   are captured by Captain Hook, who also tries to poison Peter's medicine
   while the boy is asleep. When Peter awakes, he learns from the fairy
   Tinker Bell that Wendy has been kidnapped - in an effort to please
   Wendy, he goes to drink his medicine. Tink does not have time to warn
   him of the poison, and instead drinks it herself, causing her near
   death. Tink tells him she could be saved if children believed in
   fairies. In one of the play's most famous moments, Peter turns to the
   audience watching the play and begs those who believe in fairies to
   clap their hands.

   Peter heads to the ship. On the way, he encounters the ticking
   crocodile; Peter decides to copy the tick, so any animals will
   recognise it and leave him unharmed. He does not realise that he is
   still ticking as he boards the ship, where Hook cowers, mistaking him
   for the crocodile. While the pirates are searching for the croc, Peter
   sneaks into the cabin to steal the keys and frees the Lost Boys. When
   the pirates investigate a noise in the cabin, Peter defeats them. When
   he finally reveals himself, he and Hook begin the climactic battle,
   which Peter easily wins. He kicks Hook into the jaws of the waiting
   crocodile, and Hook dies with the satisfaction that Peter had literally
   kicked him off the ship, which Hook considers "bad form". Then Peter
   takes control of the ship, and sails the seas back to London.

   In the end, Wendy decides that her place is at home, much to the joy of
   her heartsick mother. Wendy then brings all the boys but Peter back to
   London. Before Wendy and her brothers arrive at their house, Peter
   flies ahead, to try and bar the window so Wendy will think her mother
   has forgotten her. But when he learns of Mrs. Darling's distress, he
   bitterly leaves the window open and flies away. Peter returns briefly,
   and he meets Mrs. Darling, who has agreed to adopt the Lost Boys. She
   offers to adopt Peter as well, but Peter refuses, afraid they will
   "catch him and make him a man." It is hinted that Mary Darling knew
   Peter when she was a girl, because she is left slightly changed when
   Peter leaves.

   Peter promises to return for Wendy every spring. The final scene of the
   play takes place a year later when we see Wendy preparing to go back
   home after the spring-cleaning has taken place. It is stated that
   Tinker Bell has died during this year since fairies are naturally
   short-lived creatures. However, Peter has already forgotten about
   Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys and even Hook when Wendy returns, and he
   does not understand Wendy's wistful wish that she could take him back
   with her. According to the narrator of the play "It has something to do
   with the riddle of his being. If he could get the hang of the thing his
   cry might become "To live would be an awfully big adventure!""
