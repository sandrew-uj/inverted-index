   The Mortal Instruments is a series of six young adult fantasy novels
   written by American author Cassandra Clare, the last of which was
   published on May 27, 2014. The Mortal Instruments is chronologically
   the third^[1] series of a planned five in The Shadowhunter Chronicles
   but was the first one published. It follows Clarissa Fray, who
   interacts with a group of Nephilim known as Shadowhunters while also
   discovering her own heritage and her family history. The Shadowhunters
   protect the world of mundane/human people, who are also called mundanes
   or "mundies", from dark forces beyond their world.

   The book series has become popular within the young adult genre of
   paranormal romance/urban fantasy and supernatural, but Clare did not
   originally intend to write the series for teens. When she began writing
   City of Bones, she did not view it as a young adult work, but first and
   foremost as a fantasy novel, where the main characters just happened to
   be teenagers. When she was approached by a publisher interested in
   aging up her characters, she ultimately decided that she "wanted to
   tell a story about characters at that crucial life stage just between
   adolescence and adulthood, where your choices determine the kind of
   person you're going to be rather than reflecting who you already
   are."^[2]
