   Jonathan Dark (Jandar), earthman mysteriously transported to the Jovian
   moon of Callisto (or Thanator), has succeeded in rescuing Princess
   Darloona of Shondakar from the Sky Pirates of Zanadar, only to see her
   fall into the hands of the Black Legion, the mercenary force that had
   previously occupied her native city and driven her and her followers
   into exile.

   Journeying to Shondakar, Jandar improbably finds himself in the
   Legion's good graces after saving the son of its leader, the very man
   that leader intends to have Darloona wed in order to cement his control
   of the city. Having essentially been given a free hand to spy on the
   enemy, Jandar scouts out the city's defenses and weaknesses,
   particularly its tunnel system. He disrupts the wedding as Darloona's
   Ku Thad people infiltrate Shondakar through the tunnels and take the
   occupiers by surprise.

   Jandar kills the mastermind behind the princess's misfortunes, the
   supposed priest Oola, who is secretly one of the Mind Wizards
   conspiring to take over all of Thanator. But during the battle the Sky
   Pirates invade, and while the Ku Thad are ultimately victorious over
   both foes, Prince Thuton of Zanadar escapes, carrying Darloona back to
   the captivity from which Jandar sprung her in the previous volume. Back
   to square one...
