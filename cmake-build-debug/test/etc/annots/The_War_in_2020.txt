   During the 1990s, intense trade competition gradually makes Japan a
   major trading power against the United States and the European Union,
   which gradually worked for the dissolution of NATO. The Japanese also
   use their position to expand the mandate of the Self-Defense Forces and
   even export its military technology.

   The U.S. military draws down its forces for most of the 1990s, starting
   with deployments during Operation Desert Shield and Latin American
   interventions, while disarming most of its nuclear arsenal, in parallel
   with the (fictionally perennial) Soviet Union; in addition, the
   drawdowns affect the military intelligence community due to what was
   proving to be over-dependence on automated means of intelligence
   gathering. The situation comes to a head in 2005 when instability in
   Zaire's Shaba province prompts the South African Defence Force
   (equipped and trained by Japan) to seize mineral-rich sections of the
   area. The United States sends the XVIII Airborne Corps along with
   associated air and naval assets to repel the aggression.
