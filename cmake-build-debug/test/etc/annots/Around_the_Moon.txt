   Having been fired out of the giant Columbiad space gun, the Baltimore
   Gun Club's bullet-shaped projectile, along with its three passengers,
   Barbicane, Nicholl and Michael Ardan, begins the five-day trip to the
   Moon. A few minutes into the journey, a small, bright asteroid passes
   within a few hundred yards of them, but does not collide with the
   projectile. The asteroid had been captured by the Earth's gravity and
   had become a second moon.

   The three travelers undergo a series of adventures and misadventures
   during the rest of the journey, including disposing of the body of a
   dog out a window, suffering intoxication by gases, and making
   calculations leading them, briefly, to believe that they are to fall
   back to Earth. During the latter part of the voyage, it becomes
   apparent that the gravitational force of their earlier encounter with
   the asteroid has caused the projectile to deviate from its course.

   The projectile enters lunar orbit, rather than landing on the Moon as
   originally planned. Barbicane, Ardan and Nicholl begin geographical
   observations with opera glasses. The projectile then dips over the
   northern hemisphere of the Moon, into the darkness of its shadow. It is
   plunged into extreme cold, before emerging into the light and heat
   again. They then begin to approach the Moon's southern hemisphere. From
   the safety of their projectile, they gain spectacular views of Tycho,
   one of the greatest of all craters on the Moon. The three men discuss
   the possibility of life on the Moon, and conclude that it is barren.
   The projectile begins to move away from the Moon, towards the 'dead
   point' (the place at which the gravitational attraction of the Moon and
   Earth becomes equal). Michel Ardan hits upon the idea of using the
   rockets fixed to the bottom of the projectile (which they were
   originally going to use to deaden the shock of landing) to propel the
   projectile towards the Moon and hopefully cause it to fall onto it,
   thereby achieving their mission.

   When the projectile reaches the point of neutral attraction, the
   rockets are fired, but it is too late. The projectile begins a fall
   onto the Earth from a distance of 260,000 kilometres (160,000 mi), and
   it is to strike the Earth at a speed of 185,400 km/h (115,200 mph), the
   same speed at which it left the mouth of the Columbiad. All hope seems
   lost for Barbicane, Nicholl and Ardan. Four days later, the crew of a
   US Navy vessel, Susquehanna, spots a bright meteor fall from the sky
   into the sea. This turns out to be the returning projectile. A rescue
   operation is assembled, intending to raise the capsule from a depth of
   20,000 feet, using diving bells and steam-powered grappling claws.
   After several days of fruitless searches, all hope is lost and the
   rescue party heads home. On the way back, a lookout spots a strange
   shining buoy. Only then the rescuers realize that the hollow alluminium
   projectile had positive buoyancy and thus must have surfaced after
   impact. The 'buoy' turns out to be the projectile and three men inside
   are found to be alive and well. They are treated to lavish homecoming
   celebrations as the first people to leave Earth.
