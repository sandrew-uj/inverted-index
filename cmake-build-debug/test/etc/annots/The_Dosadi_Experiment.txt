   The novel is set in a distant future when humans are part of an
   interstellar civilization called the ConSentiency composed of many
   species. One, the Taprisiots, provide instant mind-to-mind
   communication between two sentient minds anywhere in the universe, and
   the Caleban provide "jump-doors" (which allow instantaneous travel
   between any two points in the universe). This is the glue that holds
   the far-flung ConSentiency together. Unfortunately, one consequence of
   jump-door technology is the possibility that large numbers of
   unsuspecting sentients can be diverted to destinations unknown for
   nefarious purposes. A government saboteur attempts to expose one such
   plot.

   Jorj X. McKie is a Saboteur Extraordinary, one of the principals of the
   Bureau of Sabotage, and the only human admitted to practice law before
   the Gowachin bar as a legum (lawyer). While meditating in a park in the
   Bureau's headquarters, McKie is mentally contacted by the Caleban
   Fannie Mae, a female member of a multidimensional species of
   unparalleled power whose visible manifestation in this universe is the
   star Thyone in the Pleiades cluster.

   Generations ago, a secret, unauthorized experiment by the Gowachins was
   carried out with the help of a contract with the Calebans. They
   isolated the planet Dosadi behind an impenetrable barrier called "The
   God Wall". On the planet were placed humans and Gowachin, with an odd
   mix of modern and old technology. The planet itself is massively
   poisonous except for a narrow valley, containing the city "Chu", into
   which nearly 89 million humans and Gowachin are crowded under terrible
   conditions. It is ruled by a dictator, many other forms of government
   having been tried previously, but without the ability to remove such
   things as the DemoPol, a computer system used to manipulate populaces
   without their consent or knowledge. The culture of ordinary day-to-day
   power in Dosadi is very violent. Among other tools, addictive
   psychotropes are used for handling power among hierarchies in
   organisations.

   Senior Liator (or Liaitor) Keila Jedrik starts a war that will change
   Dosadi forever. Jorj travels to Dosadi and escapes with Keila after
   engaging in ego sharing. This gives them the ability to swap bodies and
   thus by using a hole in the contract sealing Dosadi they can escape via
   jump gate. Once free, by legal manoeuvring the Dosadi population is
   unleashed upon the ConSentiency for good or ill, while the people who
   set the project in motion try to deal with the consequences, having
   sent McKie there hoping a solution more in their interest could be
   found.
