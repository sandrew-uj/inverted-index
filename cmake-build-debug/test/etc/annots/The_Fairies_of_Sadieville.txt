   Graduate students, Justin and Veronica find a century-old silent film
   showing what appears to be a girl transforming into a fairy. It took
   place in Sadieville, a mining town in Tennessee. The pair visit
   Needsville in Cloud County to investigate. They discover that in 1915
   Sadieville disappeared when a cavern beneath it collapsed. This leads
   the pair to uncovering a long-forgotten cave with a portal to Tir na
   nOg. The Tufa realize they have an opportunity to return to their
   homeland from where they were exiled thousands of years ago, but are
   conflicted over whether to leave their new home in the Appalachian
   mountains or not.
