   Strange objects have been sighted on the Moon near Mons Pico.
   Suspecting a communist plot, the British Government hurriedly plans a
   mission to photograph the domes from above closer range. The rocket is
   not large enough to send a man - enter Chris Godfrey, a 17-year-old
   science whiz with an interest in rocketry and crucially less than 5
   feet tall!

   The launch site is Woomera Rocket Research Station in South Australia,
   but there may be a Soviet traitor amongst the ground crew...

   The book pre-dates the first actual usage of satellite imagery by two
   years, and human spaceflight by four years.
