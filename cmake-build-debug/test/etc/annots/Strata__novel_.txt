   Kin Arad is a human planetary engineer working for "the Company", a
   human organisation that manufactures habitable planets using techniques
   and equipment salvaged from an extinct alien race, the "Spindle Kings",
   who excelled at terraforming.

   The express purpose of the Company's planet-manufacturing business is
   to create dispersed branches of humanity, diverse enough to ensure the
   whole species' survival for eternity. The Earth's population in the
   past has been decimated due to the lethal "Mindquakes", epidemic mass
   deaths caused by too much homogeneity among the populace.^[2]^(p 279)

   All planets built by the Company are carefully crafted with artificial
   strata containing synthetic fossils, indistinguishable from the real
   thing. On occasion, however, mischievous Company employees often
   attempt to place anomalous objects in the strata as practical jokes,
   like running shoes, or other out-of-place artefacts, hoping to raise
   confusion among future archaeologists when the planets' beginnings have
   been long forgotten. However the Company forbids this, and secretly
   monitors the generated strata in order to detect embedded jokes,
   fearing such actions may cause the collapse of entire civilizations
   when the artifacts are eventually unearthed.^[2]^(p 14-15)

   Kin and two aliens are recruited by the mysterious Jago Jalo for an
   expedition. One alien is a paranoid, four-armed, frog-like, muscular
   "Kung" named Marco. The other alien is a bear-like "Shand", historian
   and linguist named Silver. Jago Jalo is a human who returned from a
   relativistic journey he embarked on more than a thousand years ago,
   where he made a stunning discovery: A flat Earth.

   When the team rendezvous with Jago Jalo on the Kung homeworld, the
   violent Jalo unexpectedly has a heart attack and dies. Kin Arad is
   shocked by the large store of weapons on-board Jalo's spaceship, and
   has misgivings about the expedition; Silver and Marco, however, see the
   possibility of reaping great technological rewards and launch the
   vessel on autopilot.

   When the expedition arrives at Jalo's pre-programmed coordinates, they
   find a flattened version of the medieval Eastern hemisphere of the
   Earth they had originally departed from, before their disturbing
   rendezvous with Jalo. Clearly artificial, the disc rotates around its
   hub, and is contained inside a gigantic hollow sphere with tiny
   artificial "stars" affixed to the interior, augmented with a small
   meandering artificial sun, moon, and fake planets revolving around it.

   Their ship is hit by one of the "planets" wandering on the interior of
   the sphere, so Kin, Marco, and Silver are forced to abandon ship. They
   land on the flat planet with the help of their "lift-belt" equipped
   suits, while their ship crashes. A return from the flat world now seems
   impossible, but hoping for assistance from the disc's mysterious
   builders, Kin, Marco, and Silver set off towards a structure they had
   spotted at the disc's hub. It is the only thing on the flat "Earth"
   which does not match the geography of the spherical Earth they left.

   En route, the team encounter the superstitious Medieval inhabitants of
   the disc, who believe the end of the world is near, due to increasingly
   chaotic climate (caused by the disc's machinery breaking down), the
   recent disappearance of one of their planets, and the general
   devastation caused by the ship's crash. The three travelers also
   discover a number of other differences.

   What Kin Arad knows as "Reme" is called "Rome" on the disc, and there
   is a strange "Christos cult" that is completely unfamiliar to Kin.
   Also, Venus is conspicuously lacking its giant (lunar-sized) moon
   "Adonis", which dominates the sunset sky on the Earth Kin Arad came
   from, which was formative in leading humanity to an early heliocentric
   world view.^[2]^(p 130-131)

   Since only the Eastern hemisphere of Earth is represented, the
   continent of America is completely missing, so Kin, Marco, and Silver
   rescue a party of Vikings in the process of searching for Vinland, when
   their ship is about to sail over the edge of the world.

   The flat world is apparently an extremely old and sophisticated
   automated system. In addition, there are real magical creatures and
   objects on the disc - Demons, and magic purses, and flying carpets -
   all of which, the travelers deduce, are themselves highly advanced,
   sophisticated technological constructs, just like the disc.

   The travelers eventually reach the structure at the hub and make
   contact with the disc's automated control-systems. They are told that
   (aside from the recent damage) the sheer build-up of entropy in the old
   machinery has exceeded the capacity of its advanced robotic
   maintenance. Catastrophic failure threatens the disc's further
   existence. The machines offer to exchange their advanced technology for
   the construction of a real (spherical) planet as a refuge for the disc
   "Earth" inhabitants. Kin, the planetary engineer, agrees. She is
   excited about the massive task at hand; just like the parallel
   character Louis Wu in Ringworld, Kin is over two hundred years old, and
   in danger of becoming tired of life.

   The implication of the denouement is that the conventional planet Kin
   Arad will build is in fact the readers' own "Earth". By the end of the
   story, Kin comes to the further suspicion that the builders of the flat
   world constructed the whole universe. The evidence of previous races
   would then be hoaxes, and the flat world itself would be a prank by the
   universe's construction crew - analogous to the artificial strata Kin
   and the Company manufacture, and the occasional prankster employees
   inserting hoaxes in the artificial strata.
