   Jernau Morat Gurgeh, a famously skillful player of board games and
   other similar contests, lives on Chiark Orbital, and is bored with his
   successful life. The Culture's Special Circumstances (SC) inquires
   about his willingness to participate in a long journey but won't
   explain further unless Gurgeh agrees to participate. While he is
   considering this offer, one of his drone friends, Mawhrin-Skel, which
   had been ejected from SC due to its unstable personality, convinces him
   to cheat in one of his matches in an attempt to win in an
   unprecedentedly perfect fashion. The attempt fails, but Mawhrin-Skel
   uses its recording of the event to blackmail Gurgeh into accepting the
   offer, so that he can use his connections with SC to request that
   Mawhrin-Skel be admitted back into SC as well.

   Gurgeh spends the next two years travelling to the Empire of Azad in
   the Small Magellanic Cloud, where a complex game (also named Azad) is
   used to determine social rank and political status. The game itself is
   sufficiently subtle and complex that a player's tactics reflect their
   own political and philosophical outlook. By the time he arrives, he has
   grasped the game but is unsure how he will measure up against opponents
   who have been studying it for their entire lives.

   Gurgeh lands on the Empire's home planet of Eae, accompanied by another
   drone, Flere-Imsaho. As a Culture citizen, he naturally plays with a
   style markedly different from his opponents, many of whom stack the
   odds against him one way or another, such as forming backroom
   agreements to cooperate against him (which is allowed by the game's
   rules). As he advances through the tournament he is matched against
   increasingly powerful Azad politicians, and ultimately the Emperor
   himself in the final round. The final contests take place on
   Echronedal, the Fire Planet, which undergoes a natural conflagration
   fueled by native plants that produce huge amounts of oxygen. The final
   game is timed to end when the flames engulf the castle where the event
   takes place, symbolically renewing the Empire by fire. However, faced
   with defeat, the Emperor orders his men to kill all the spectators and
   attempts to kill Gurgeh. Instead, the Emperor is killed by a shot from
   his own weapon that was deflected by Flere-Imsaho (who later refuses to
   tell Gurgeh if it was coincidental).

   Flere-Imsaho reveals that Gurgeh's participation was part of a Culture
   plot to overthrow the corrupt and savage Empire from within, and that
   he, the player, was in fact a pawn in a much larger game. He is further
   told that in the aftermath of the final game, the Empire of Azad
   collapsed without further intervention from the Culture. Although
   Gurgeh never discovers the whole truth, in the final sentences of the
   novel the narrator is revealed to be Flere-Imsaho, who had been
   disguised as Mawhrin-Skel to manipulate Gurgeh into taking part in the
   game.
