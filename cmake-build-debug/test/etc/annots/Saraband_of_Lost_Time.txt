   The story takes place in thirty-five chapters. The characters come from
   a variety of locations, and travel across the land in their adventures.
   Grant created his own place names, drinks, songs and more for this
   novel. Unlike many fantasy novels, he did not create a map of the
   world, which is supposedly a futuristic Earth after the occurrence of
   an apocalypse of some kind. It may or may not be the same world as used
   in Rumors of Spring and Through the Heart. The characters are still
   human and are not a great deal different from modern humans in most
   cases. In all three books, the humans are mostly dealing with major
   environmental changes and the resulting changes in humanity, but some
   people have stood out as different.
