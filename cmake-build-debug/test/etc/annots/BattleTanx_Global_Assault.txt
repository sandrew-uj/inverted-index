   On January 13, 2006, the evil Queenlord Cassandra is spying on Griffin
   Spade's family and orders her troops to kidnap Griffin's son Brandon
   and kill everyone else. Griffin and his army manage to push back the
   invaders, but Cassandra soon turns the tables by mind-controlling
   Griffin's own army. Griffin and Madison manage to escape San Francisco
   and begin chasing Cassandra across the United States, eventually
   cornering her in Washington. Cassandra, however, escapes with Brandon
   to the United Kingdom; Griffin and Madison follow. They build a new
   army in Europe and chase her through England, France and Germany.

   While in Paris, they discover Cassandra released the virus in 2001 to
   kill every woman on Earth who did not have the power of the Edge. In
   Berlin, Griffin finally rescues Brandon. They make it back to San
   Francisco and push back another invasion by the Storm Ravens, and
   finally corner and defeat Cassandra on Alcatraz Island. The story ends
   with a cliffhanger, as an unidentified magician finds Cassandra's body
   and speaks of a "chosen one" as he resurrects her.
