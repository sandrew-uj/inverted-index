   Angels and mortals, who need one another but have a love-hate
   relationship, inhabit the land of Samaria. The angels have wings and
   fly, and are taller and stronger than humans. Legends state that angels
   were made by Jovah to oversee Samaria under the guidance of the
   Archangel. The angels are supposed to protect humans, answer their
   petitions, solve their problems, and intercede to god for them by
   petitioning the god Jovah through song, especially for rain when the
   crops need it and the sun when it is stormy. In addition, the angels
   must sing to Jovah at the annual Gloria held on the Plain of Sharon,
   otherwise god would destroy the world. The Archangel and his consort,
   the Angelica, lead this mass in praise of Jovah. Archangels do not
   serve for life, but every twenty years Jovah selects a new Archangel.

   Samaria is divided into three regions, Gaza, Bethel and Jordana,
   separated by rivers. Each region has an angel hold or fortress that
   acts as the governing center for the region. The citizens of Gaza, the
   Manadavvi, are highly cultured and wealthy. The Jansai, who are
   calculating and greedy merchants, and run the Edori slave trade inhabit
   Jordana. The Edori are the wanderers and frequently become enslaved by
   the Jansai.

   The Oracle has declared that the angel Gabriel is to be the next
   Archangel. However, Raphael, the current Archangel, who is corrupt and
   uses his position for himself, does not want to step down. Gabriel has
   an additional problem in that he procrastinated getting married. He
   tracks down the mortal that god has selected be his wife, but she has
   her own thoughts about the marriage and the expectations of her as the
   archangel's consort, the Angelica. Rachel, an Edori slave, dislikes
   angels because of what they had done to her family when she was
   younger. Gabriel is faced with many trials having to contend with
   Raphael on the one hand, and his reluctant wife, who is a constant
   thorn-in-the-side. But the trials and tribulations confronting Gabriel
   and Rachel brings them close together and they finally realize that
   they love each other. The story ends with Gabriel and Rachael singing
   together at the Gloria, thus satisfying the wishes of the god.
