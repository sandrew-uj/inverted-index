   Tithe follows the story of sixteen-year-old American Kaye Fierch, a
   young nomad who tours the country with her mother's rock band. The book
   begins in Philadelphia, at a gig her mother's band Stepping Razor is
   playing in a seedy bar in Philadelphia. After her mother's boyfriend
   and guitarist, Lloyd, attempts to stab her mother under the enchantment
   of Nephamael (a knight of the Unseelie Court) her mother takes her back
   to Kaye's grandmother's house in New Jersey to stay.

   Once at her grandmother's house, Kaye begins to look for her old
   "imaginary" friends she had during her childhood, faeries named
   Lutie-Loo, Spike, and Gristle. However, she fails to find them and,
   begins to suspect that they were simply figments of her imagination.
   Her suspicions dissolve when she finds and saves the life of Roiben, a
   faerie knight, by pulling an iron-tipped arrow from his chest. In
   return, he grants her three truthfully answered questions about
   anything she chooses, which she does not immediately use. Soon after
   this, Spike and Lutie-Loo contact her and warn her that Roiben is a
   murderer who has killed Gristle. As revenge, Kaye tricks Roiben into
   telling her his full name (she later learns that faeries can be
   controlled by their true names).

   Later on, her friends tell her that she is a changeling and that she
   should keep her human appearance, because the Unseelie Court wishes to
   use her as a "Tithe" in order to bind the Solitary Fey to the Court's
   queen, Nicnevin. Since Kaye is not mortal, the ritual will be forfeit,
   and the fey whom the Unseelie Court wishes to bind will go free. Kaye
   attempts to control her newfound abilities by enlisting the help of a
   kelpie to teach her how to use magic. She is soon kidnapped by a group
   of fairies, as planned and is taken to the Unseelie Court to go through
   the sacrificial ceremony. Before the ceremony, Roiben has a dress made
   for her and allowed her to stay with him that night, when they
   acknowledge each other's feelings. At the climax of the ceremony, Kaye
   uses Roiben's full name and orders him to free her from her bonds
   before she is killed, resulting in a bloodbath between Roiben and the
   court, and then fleeing to safety. He kills the queen of the Unseelie
   Court and many of her guards.

   Kaye and Roiben spend the day at Kaye's home, and discover that strange
   events are affecting the mortal world. Odd reports of mauling and
   kidnappings are reported on the news and Roiben makes Kaye understand
   that this is a result of the solitary fey being free for the next seven
   years. Kaye receives a call from her friend Janet, inviting her to come
   to a Halloween rave held at the waterfront, she tries to persuade her
   not to go but fails. After a failed attempt to receive help from her
   "imaginary" faerie friends, Roiben and Kaye attend the rave. They are
   separated, and Kaye successfully locates her friends, but briefly
   leaves them to apologize to Janet's boyfriend for bewitching him
   earlier in the novel. However, she finds that the kelpie who lives near
   the waterfront has taken Janet into the water to kill her. In the
   novel, it is suggested that Janet went with him out of loneliness and a
   desire to get revenge on her boyfriend for going off with Kaye. Kaye
   follows but is too late and she manages to convince the kelpie to
   relinquish her body. Roiben finds Kaye mourning for her friend and gets
   her home.

   The next morning, she and Roiben travel to the Seelie Court's camp some
   distance away to see if Corny is there. They reach a dead end, but
   discover that the knight (Nephamael) has proclaimed himself the king of
   the Unseelie Court. Roiben is suspicious of the situation and thinks
   that it is a trap for Kaye and him. Later, Roiben's suspicions are
   proved correct when they enter the Unseelie Court. Nephamael, who had
   discovered Roiben's true name from Spike before killing him, uses it to
   take control over Roiben. He orders him to seize Kaye, but Roiben uses
   trickery to let her get away. Kaye then devises a plan to poison
   Nephamael, while Corny and Roiben amuse him. She goes through with it;
   however, before Nephamael is dead, the Seelie Queen arrives, hoping to
   take over the court (right after her arrival Corny goes insane and
   stabs Nephamael multiple times, ultimately killing him). Roiben
   prevents the Queen's takeover attempt by claiming the throne as his.
