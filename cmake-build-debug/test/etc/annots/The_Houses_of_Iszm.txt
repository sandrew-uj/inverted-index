   The inhabitants of a planet called Iszm, a species known as the Iszic,
   have evolved the native giant trees into living homes, with all needs
   and various luxuries supplied by the trees' own natural growth. The
   Iszic maintain a jealously guarded monopoly, exporting only enough
   trees to keep prices high and make a great profit. Ailie Farr is a
   human botanist who goes to Iszm (like many others before him, of many
   species) to try to steal a female tree, which might allow the
   propagation of the species off world and break the monopoly.
