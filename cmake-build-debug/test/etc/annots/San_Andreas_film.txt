   Caltech seismologist Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Giamatti) and his colleague
   Dr. Kim Park (Lee) are at Hoover Dam testing a new earthquake
   prediction model when a nearby and previously unknown fault ruptures,
   triggering a 7.1 magnitude earthquake that collapses the dam; Park is
   killed when his foot is pierced by protruding rebar in the midst of an
   effort to rescue a young girl, pinning him to a section of the dam that
   is washed away. Hayes discovers that the entire San Andreas Fault is
   shifting and will soon cause a series of major earthquakes, potentially
   destroying cities along the fault line. He begins racing to warn the
   population of California along with his students Alexi (Utgoff) and
   Phoebe (Neitling) and reporter Serena Johnson (Panjabi).

   When a 9.1 magnitude earthquake devastates Los Angeles and San
   Francisco, Ray Gaines (Johnson), a Los Angeles Fire Department
   helicopter-rescue pilot going through a divorce from his wife Emma
   (Gugino), finds himself rescuing her from a skyscraper in Los Angeles.
   Meanwhile, their daughter Blake (Daddario) has been visiting San
   Francisco with Emma's new boyfriend Daniel (Gruffudd) when an
   earthquake strikes the city, rubble from the collapsing parking garage
   pins her in Daniel's car. Panicking, Daniel leaves Blake in an act of
   cowardice. Ben Taylor (Johnstone-Burt), a British engineer seeking
   employment at Daniel's firm, and his younger brother Ollie (Parkinson)
   rescue Blake and they reach Chinatown, successfully calling her parents
   for help.

   Ray and Emma attempt to reach San Francisco in Ray's helicopter until
   it suffers a gearbox failure, forcing them to make an emergency landing
   at a shopping mall in Bakersfield. Amid the chaos of looting, Ray
   steals a truck to continue the journey. The pair encounter a couple
   broken down on the side of the road, shortly before the San Andreas
   Fault, which has torn a large fissure through the highway and extends
   for the perceivable length of the fault in either direction. Ray and
   Emma exchange the truck for an airplane the couple owns. As Blake, Ben,
   and Ollie attempt to reach Nob Hill to signal the pair after finding
   their previous meeting point at Coit Tower engulfed in flames, Ray and
   Emma are forced to parachute into AT&T Park just before a 9.6 magnitude
   quake hits, becoming the largest recorded earthquake in history.

   As the quake subsides, having destroyed much of the city, Ray and Emma
   commandeer a boat to reach the group, only to realize a tsunami is
   approaching San Francisco Bay. Alongside a handful of other survivors
   in small boats, the two manage to cross the wave before it crests,
   barely avoiding a container ship caught up in the wave. The ship
   bisects the Golden Gate Bridge's center span in half, killing everyone
   on the bridge, including Daniel. The tsunami proceeds to strike the
   ruined city, capsizing a cruise ship in the process, and killing
   thousands more. Blake, Ben, and Ollie enter the Gate, a building whose
   construction Daniel had been overseeing, but are still caught by the
   wave. As the building begins to collapse, trapping Blake underwater,
   Ray dives in, rescues her, and begins performing CPR. Emma crashes the
   boat through a window and drives the five of them out of the collapsing
   building as Ray resuscitates Blake.

   The survivors regroup at a relief camp on the other side of the bay,
   where the reconciled Ray and Emma talk about their future. On the
   remains of the Golden Gate Bridge an American flag unfolds, giving hope
   that the city will recover and rebuild, as rescue vehicles descend on
   the radically altered landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area, which
   has now extended from San Jose to Santa Cruz, turning the San Francisco
   Peninsula into an island.
