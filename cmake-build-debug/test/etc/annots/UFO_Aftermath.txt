   In May 2004, a giant spacecraft approached Earth. Hovering over the
   planet, it released large clouds of spores into the upper atmosphere.
   Rapidly multiplying, the spores soon darkened the skies, obscuring the
   sun completely. This period is known as the "Twilight". Having reached
   critical mass in the skies, the spores began to rain down, clogging the
   streets and bodies of water, smothering people in their homes and
   burying animals in the wild. During the "Nightfall", as it would come
   to be called, most of the higher life forms on earth were wiped out.
   During the Twilight, all human responses were futile. The governments
   of the world chose caution over aggression, not realizing how quickly
   the end could come, and were buried. However, a few survivors sealed
   themselves in underground bases with stocks of food and oxygen. After
   several weeks, the spores seemed to disintegrate, decomposing and
   settling into the soil.

   The player must gather together the remaining peoples of the planet,
   find out what has happened, and, if possible, take vengeance. The
   aliens the player fights are known as the Reticulans, who are heavily
   based on Greys, controlling various horrific mutant lifeforms.
