   In June, 2009, it was announced that Deadworld was to be turned into a
   film. Jeffrey D. Erb and Framelight Productions along with Dark Hero
   Studios partners David Hayter and Benedict Carver have teamed up with
   Bill Mechanic to turn the comic book into a zombie feature
   franchise. In 2013, Gary Reed announced that the option had
   expired and he did not renew it. The film has been put back onto the
   schedule and is now in pre-production for a as yet unknown
   release.
