   In the form of a journal, the narrator, an upper-class, unmarried,
   bourgeois man, conveys his troubled thoughts and feelings of anguish.
   This anguish occurs for four days after he sees a "superb three-mast"
   Brazilian ship and impulsively waves to it, unconsciously inviting the
   supernatural being aboard the boat to haunt his home.

   All around him, he senses the presence of a being that he calls the
   "Horla". The torment that the Horla causes is first manifested
   physically: The narrator complains that he suffers from "an atrocious
   fever", and that he has trouble sleeping. He wakes up from nightmares
   with the chilling feeling that someone is watching him and "kneeling on
    chest."

   Throughout the short story, the main character's sanity, or rather, his
   feelings of alienation, are put into question as the Horla
   progressively dominates his thoughts. Initially, the narrator himself
   questions his sanity, exclaiming "Am I going mad?" after having found
   his glass of water empty, despite not having drunk from it. He later
   decides that he is not, in fact, going mad, since he is fully
   "conscious" of his "state" and that he could indeed "analyze it with
   the most complete lucidity." The presence of the Horla becomes more and
   more intolerable to the protagonist, as it is "watching...looking
   at... dominating" him.

   After reading about a large number of Brazilians who fled their homes,
   bemoaning the fact that "they are pursued, possessed, governed like
   human cattle by...a species of vampire, which feeds on their life while
   they are asleep... drinks water," the narrator soon realizes the
   Horla was aboard the Brazilian three-mast boat that he had previously
   greeted. He feels so "lost" and "possessed" to the point that he is
   ready to kill either the Horla, or himself.
