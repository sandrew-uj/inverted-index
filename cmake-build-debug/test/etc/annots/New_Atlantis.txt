   The novel depicts a mythical island, Bensalem, which is discovered by
   the crew of a European ship after they are lost in the Pacific Ocean
   somewhere west of Peru. The minimal plot serves the gradual unfolding
   of the island, its customs, but most importantly, its state-sponsored
   scientific institution, Salomon's House, "which house or college ... is
   the very eye of this kingdom."

   Many aspects of the society and history of the island are described,
   such as the Christian religion - which is reported to have been born
   there as a copy of the Bible and a letter from the Apostle Saint
   Bartholomew arrived there miraculously, a few years after the Ascension
   of Jesus; a cultural feast in honour of the family institution, called
   "the Feast of the Family"; a college of sages, the Salomon's House,
   "the very eye of the kingdom", to which order "God of heaven and earth
   had vouchsafed the grace to know the works of Creation, and the secrets
   of them", as well as "to discern between divine miracles, works of
   nature, works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts"; and a
   series of instruments, process and methods of scientific research that
   were employed in the island by the Salomon's House.

   The interlocutors include the governor of the House of Strangers,
   Joabin the Jew, and the Head of Salomon's House.

   The inhabitants of Bensalem are described as having a high moral
   character and honesty, as no official accepts any payment from
   individuals. The people are also described as chaste and pious, as said
   by an inhabitant of the island:

     But hear me now, and I will tell you what I know. You shall
     understand that there is not under the heavens so chaste a nation as
     this of Bensalem; nor so free from all pollution or foulness. It is
     the virgin of the world. I remember I have read in one of your
     European books, of an holy hermit amongst you that desired to see
     the Spirit of Fornication; and there appeared to him a little foul
     ugly Aethiop. But if he had desired to see the Spirit of Chastity of
     Bensalem, it would have appeared to him in the likeness of a fair
     beautiful Cherubim. For there is nothing amongst mortal men more
     fair and admirable, than the chaste minds of this people. Know
     therefore, that with them there are no stews, no dissolute houses,
     no courtesans, nor anything of that kind.

   In the last third of the book, the Head of the Salomon's House takes
   one of the European visitors to show him all the scientific background
   of Salomon's House, where experiments are conducted in Baconian method
   to understand and conquer nature, and to apply the collected knowledge
   to the betterment of society. Namely: 1) the end of their foundation;
   2) the preparations they have for their works; 3) the several
   employments and functions whereto their fellows are assigned; 4) and
   the ordinances and rites which they observe.

   He portrayed a vision of the future of human discovery and knowledge.
   The plan and organisation of his ideal college, "Salomon's House",
   envisioned the modern research university in both applied and pure
   science.

   The end of their foundation is thus described: "The end of our
   foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things;
   and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of
   all things possible".

   In describing the several employments and functions to which the
   members of the Salomon's House are assigned, the Head of the college
   said:

     "For the several employments and offices of our fellows, we have
     twelve that sail into foreign countries under the names of other
     nations (for our own we conceal), who bring us the books and
     abstracts, and patterns of experiments of all other parts. These we
     call merchants of light.

     "We have three that collect the experiments which are in all books.
     These we call depredators.

     "We have three that collect the experiments of all mechanical arts,
     and also of liberal sciences, and also of practices which are not
     brought into arts. These we call mystery-men.

     "We have three that try new experiments, such as themselves think
     good. These we call pioneers or miners.

     "We have three that draw the experiments of the former four into
     titles and tables, to give the better light for the drawing of
     observations and axioms out of them. These we call compilers.

     "We have three that bend themselves, looking into the experiments of
     their fellows, and cast about how to draw out of them things of use
     and practice for man's life and knowledge, as well for works as for
     plain demonstration of causes, means of natural divinations, and the
     easy and clear discovery of the virtues and parts of bodies. These
     we call dowry-men or benefactors.

     "Then after diverse meetings and consults of our whole number, to
     consider of the former labours and collections, we have three that
     take care out of them to direct new experiments, of a higher light,
     more penetrating into nature than the former. These we call lamps.

     "We have three others that do execute the experiments so directed,
     and report them. These we call inoculators.

     "Lastly, we have three that raise the former discoveries by
     experiments into greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms. These
     we call interpreters of nature."

   Even this short excerpt demonstrates that Bacon understood that science
   requires analysis and not just the accumulation of observations. Bacon
   also foresaw that the design of experiments could be improved.^[2]

   In describing the ordinances and rites observed by the scientists of
   Salomon's House, its Head said:

     We have certain hymns and services, which we say daily, of Lord and
     thanks to God for His marvellous works; and some forms of prayer,
     imploring His aid and blessing for the illumination of our labors,
     and the turning of them into good and holy uses.

   And finally, after showing all the scientific background of Salomon's
   House, he gave the European visitor permission to publish it:

     And when he had said this, he stood up; and I, as I had been taught,
     kneeled down, and he laid his right hand upon my head, and said;
     "God bless thee, my son; and God bless this relation, which I have
     made. I give thee leave to publish it for the good of other nations;
     for we here are in God's bosom, a land unknown."
