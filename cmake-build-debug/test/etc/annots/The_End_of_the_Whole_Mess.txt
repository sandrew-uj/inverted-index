   The story, narrated by Howard Fornoy in the form of a personal journal,
   recounts the life of his genius younger brother, Robert. Bobby, a child
   prodigy whose adult interests led him to study a variety of scientific
   disciplines, discovered a chemical that reduces the aggressive
   tendencies of humans and other organisms. While doing sociological
   research in Texas, Bobby used crime statistics to create a topographic
   map which displayed a geographical pattern of violent crime. Examining
   the map, Bobby noted diminishing levels of crime centered on the town
   of La Plata. When he arrives to investigate, he finds that this town
   has never had any violent crime. Bobby is ultimately able to determine
   that the cause of the non-aggression is the presence of a chemical
   unique to the town's water supply, a phenomenon that is mentioned in
   (but had nothing to do with the causations of) King's earlier novel
   It. Even minimal exposure to the chemical will
   calm an angry person or animal. Bobby isolates and reduces the chemical
   down to a concentrated form.

   At a time of international chaos suggestive of an approaching total
   nuclear war, Bobby and Howard, using the aid of a volcano in Borneo
   that is set to erupt and blow millions of tons of ash into the
   atmosphere, disperse a large quantity of this substance throughout the
   world, in the hope of preventing a catastrophe. Indeed, the effects are
   quick and expected - a massive decrease in hostilities around the
   globe.

   Several months later it is discovered that, to the Fornoys' horror,
   there was another constant about La Plata that was not studied until
   after the substance was released. It does eliminate aggression, and
   increases calm, but it does the job too well. Over time the chemical
   compound accumulates in the subject's brain, ultimately giving them
   symptoms resembling dementia or Alzheimer's disease and eventually
   resulting in death. Howard's journal entries after this point include
   increasing numbers of grammar, spelling, and other mistakes, eventually
   devolving into incoherence as Howard succumbs to the effects of the
   chemical. It is implied the human race will also eventually die out as
   humanity becomes unable to care for themselves.

   The style of Howard's entries near the end are reminiscent of those of
   the character Charlie in Daniel Keyes' book Flowers for Algernon, and
   of King's own earlier short story, Survivor Type.
