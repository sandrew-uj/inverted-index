   The Hatcher family has a new baby in the house in the beginning.
   Several months before the family temporarily moves from New York City
   to Princeton, New Jersey, the baby is born. It's a girl, and she is
   named Tamara Roxanne, who is called The Baby for weeks. Peter's
   4-year-old brother Fudge is extremely jealous of his new baby sister,
   who earns the nickname "Tootsie" from their mother Ann's cute speak and
   their grandmother Muriel's favorite old song. Peter deals with the
   fallout from Fudge's various problems, which include a spat with his
   teacher who refuses to use the name "Fudge". When his teacher refuses
   to call him Fudge, he kicks her. He also attempts to get rid of his
   sister, Tootsie, and is famous for his constant desire to involve
   himself in Peter's activities, especially with Peter's new friend, Alex
   Santo. In the end, the Hatchers decide to move back to New York City, a
   decision punctuated by Tootsie's first word which she learns while
   undergoing a diaper change.
