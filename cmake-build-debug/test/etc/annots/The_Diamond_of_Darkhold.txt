   The story begins with the Builders discussing what the Emberites should
   do when they are released from the city. It is decided that a recent
   invention (which is later shown to be a diamond-like gadget) will be
   stored alongside a guide providing information regarding its use.
   However, these items are left undiscovered when the Emberites escape.

   Nine months after Ember and Sparks have reached a truce, a roamer comes
   into town with a mysterious book, on the front of which is printed "For
   the People of Ember". Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow obtain the book via
   barter but soon learn it contains only eight pages, as the trader used
   the rest to light campfires. Unable to make sense of the book's
   remaining contents, Lina and Doon decide to return to Ember to
   investigate.

   When they arrive, they discover that a family has taken over the
   darkened city. The Troggs -- Washton, Kanza, Minny, Yorick and an
   adopted boy, Tim, whom they have named "Scawgo" -- believe they own
   Ember and have renamed it Darkhold. They capture Doon, but he manages
   to communicate with Lina and she goes back to Sparks for help.
   Meanwhile, Lizzie Bisco (from Ember), Torren Crane and Kenny Parton
   (both from Sparks) attempt to locate Lina and Doon but don't succeed,
   prompting another, larger search party to go looking for them. While
   Doon is with the Troggs, they show him a diamond they found just
   outside Ember, but Scawgo gives Doon the diamond and Doon escapes. In
   the process, he also breaks the pipe connecting the generator to the
   waterwheel that created power for Ember, thereby stopping Ember's
   lights and cutting off the city's water supply for good, making it so
   the Trogg family will have to leave Ember since they relied on the
   intermittent power-supply to pipe water to them.

   When Doon finds Lina, a pack of hungry wolves is threatening her. Doon
   throws the diamond at the wolves to frighten them away, the diamond
   shatters and he twists his ankle in the process. Lina treats his wound
   and takes him to the place where the book and the diamond were
   discovered. There, they uncover shelves filled with hundreds upon
   hundreds of diamonds, and Lina and Doon realize that the devices are
   solar-powered sources of electricity. Ultimately, the people of Sparks
   and the former Emberites help them retrieve the diamonds and other
   items left behind in Ember, enough to ensure both groups will survive
   the coming winter. Before returning to the Earth's surface, Lina goes
   to collect the drawings of her "dream city" that she sketched at her
   former home in Ember, but she does not find them, so she then goes to
   City Hall and stands on top of the building as she did in the first
   book to say "Goodbye, Ember -- forever."

   Later, the Troggs arrive in Sparks and decide to settle there after
   learning why Ember was abandoned in the first place. Tim reveals that
   he found Doon's insect book and Lina's drawings and offers to give them
   back. Lizzie takes an interest in Tim Troggs (abandoning her earlier
   hope of becoming Doon's girlfriend), while Lina gets a horse named
   Fleet and becomes a messenger like she was in Ember. The last chapter
   reveals that Lina and Doon eventually fall in love and have children
   together. Many years later, after new cities have been built using
   solar power, one of their descendants views the now-fragile pictures
   drawn by Lina as a girl in Ember and notes how strongly they resemble a
   world she didn't live to see but nonetheless helped create. The story
   then goes back to the summer after the expedition to Ember and has the
   reader imagine Torren flying an airplane to find a spacecraft flying
   through space.
