          "A rusalka is a wish. A wish not to die. A wish for revenge." --
          Rusalka, page 226^[9]

   Sasha is a 15-year-old downtrodden stable boy living with his aunt and
   uncle at an inn they run in the town of Vojvoda. Sasha's parents had
   been killed in a house fire that he was accused of starting through
   wizardry. Pyetr is one of the town's audacious young men, and one day
   he is attacked and wounded by old Yurishev for having a liaison with
   his young wife. Pyetr escapes, but later learns that Yurishev is dead,
   and that he has been accused of murdering him by sorcery. Pyetr hides
   in the stables at the inn, and Sasha helps him leave the town. With no
   future for himself in Vojvoda, Sasha accompanies the wounded Pyetr.

   Pyetr and Sasha walk for days through fields and into a dead forest.
   Sasha does not believe he is a wizard, but finds he sometimes has the
   ability to successfully wish for things. Pyetr does not believe in
   wizards at all, and laughs at Sasha's wishing. Exhausted and without
   food, the pair find a cottage by a river. Its occupant, a wizard named
   Uulamets, heals Pyetr and agrees to let them stay on condition that
   they help him find his daughter, Eveshka, who had drowned when she was
   16 and is now a rusalka. Pyetr is suspicious of Uulamets and does not
   believe in rusalkas.^[a] Later, while the three of them are searching
   for Eveshka, she makes herself visible to Pyetr, overpowers him, and
   leads him into the forest. Rusalkas are renowned for drowning men they
   have chosen, but Eveshka abandons Pyetr and disappears again. Uulamets
   and Sasha find Pyetr unharmed, but are attacked by Hwiuur, a
   shapeshifting vodyanoi, known to drown people who go too close to the
   water.

   Uulamets traps Hwiuur and threatens to kill it. The creature pleads for
   its life and admits to drowning Eveshka, but blames Chernevog, a former
   student of Uulamets. Eveshka had fallen in love with Chernevog and run
   off with him, but Chernevog had used his newly acquired wizardry to
   control her, and then handed her over to Hwiuur. Even as a rusalka
   Chernevog still controls Eveshka and will not let her return to her
   father. Uulamets agrees to let Hwiuur go on condition that he helps
   them find Chernevog.

   While searching for Chernevog, Pyetr spots Eveshka and chases after
   her. Sasha wants to follow Pyetr to protect him, but Uulamets wills
   Sasha to stay. Uulamets had recognised Sasha's potential for wizardry
   and taught him how to use his talents, but stressed the dangers of
   unchecked wishing and the importance of considering their consequences
   first. Pyetr, who now has feelings for Eveshka, and is slowly accepting
   this new world of wizards, rusalkas and river creatures, finds her and
   together they locate Chernevog's house in the forest. Chernevog
   immediately takes control of Pyetr and instructs Hwiuur to guard him.
   As Uulamets and Sasha approach the house Chernevog starts sending
   lightning bolts at them, but Uulamets is able to redirect them back at
   the house, setting it ablaze. In the chaos, Pyetr breaks free of Hwiuur
   and overpowers a weakened Chernevog. Uulamets then casts a wizard's
   once-in-a-lifetime spell and commands Eveshka to "live!".^[11] This
   final wish kills the wizard but resurrects Eveshka. Sasha discovers
   that that spell also bestowed on him all of the wizard's knowledge and
   abilities.

   Chernevog is unconscious, but Sasha cannot kill him and instead puts
   him into a long, deep sleep. Hwiuur has disappeared, and leshys^[b],
   woodland spirits, appear and celebrate the downfall of Chernevog. They
   put him on a stone in a circle of trees and agree to guard him. With
   Eveshka flesh and bone again, she and Pyetr finally unite, and Sasha,
   now a wizard, has new responsibilities to attend to.
