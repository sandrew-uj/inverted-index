   The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories follow the lives of two larcenous
   but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of
   Nehwon. In Swords Against the Shadowland, our two heroes return to
   Lankhmar, the city in which they met and in which their first loves,
   Ivrian and Vlanna, met their deaths. There, haunted by their lovers'
   ghosts, they combat a sorcerous plague cast on the city by a rogue
   wizard named Malygris.

   Chronologically the story falls between the first and second volumes of
   the complete seven volume edition of Leiber's collected stories devoted
   to the characters. The story is a direct sequel to "Ill Met in
   Lankhmar", the last story in Swords and Deviltry, and covers some of
   the same events as "The Circle Curse", the first story in Swords
   Against Death.^[3]
