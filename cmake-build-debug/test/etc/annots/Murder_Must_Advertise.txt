   Death Bredon arrives at Pym's Publicity Ltd, an advertising agency, to
   take up the post of junior copywriter. He is assigned the room of his
   predecessor Victor Dean, who has died in a fall down the office's iron
   spiral staircase. The doctor states that death was caused either by a
   broken neck, due to his landing on his head at the bottom of the stair,
   or by a wound of the right temple. The death appears suspicious, as the
   victim apparently made no attempt to save himself as he fell. In Dean's
   desk Bredon discovers a part-completed letter to the firm's proprietor,
   Mr Pym, telling him that something 'undesirable' had been going on in
   the office.

   Bredon befriends Pamela Dean, sister of the deceased, and takes her to
   a cocaine-fuelled fancy-dress party hosted by Dian de Momerie, a
   socialite with whom Dean had been associating. Disguised as Harlequin,
   Bredon attracts the attention of de Momerie and later meets her several
   times, always in disguise. His presence annoys de Momerie's companion
   Major Tod Milligan who is supplying her with drugs.

   It is revealed that Death Bredon is in fact Lord Peter Wimsey who has
   been brought in incognito by Pym to investigate. Various clues turn up:
   a catapult belonging to 'Ginger' Joe, the office boy; a carved stone
   scarab belonging to Dean; and -L-50 in banknotes found in the desk of
   Mr Tallboy, group manager.

   After having a drink in a Covent Garden pub, newspaper reporter Hector
   Puncheon discovers that someone has slipped cocaine into his coat
   pocket. Chief Inspector Charles Parker, Wimsey's brother-in-law,
   suspects that Puncheon has stumbled on Milligan's drugs gang, but finds
   no further suspicious activity there. It appears that the cocaine is
   being distributed from a different pub each week.

   Puncheon follows a man from the pub, who soon dies after falling in
   front of a train. In his flat is found a phone book with the names of
   many pubs ticked off, including the one in Covent Garden. Wimsey
   realises what has been happening. One of Pym's major clients runs a
   newspaper advertisement every Friday, the headline for which is
   approved a few days earlier. The first letter of the headline is being
   used to indicate the pub for that week, with Tallboy covertly supplying
   the letter to the gang in advance.

   Milligan is killed in an 'accident'. But the gang is still operating,
   and the police want to catch the ringleaders during their next weekly
   drug distribution. Using the phone book, all they need to find the next
   pub is the letter for the week - as provided by Tallboy.

   Wimsey is sure that Tallboy killed Victor Dean, but he does not want to
   act until the gang has been rounded up. On the night of the next drug
   distribution, Tallboy comes to Wimsey's flat to confess. He says that
   he was lured into the scheme with an innocent-sounding story and the
   offer of money, when he was in financial difficulty, but soon became
   trapped. Dean had found out and was blackmailing him, so Tallboy killed
   Dean, using Ginger Joe's catapult and the scarab, making it look like
   an accidental fall on the staircase. Wanting to spare his wife and
   child, Tallboy proposes suicide. Wimsey, seeing a gang member watching
   in the street below his window, suggests Tallboy leave, on foot,
   without looking behind him. Both know that the gang's killers are
   waiting, and Tallboy is knocked down and killed as he walks home.
