   Though its title is similar to The Forever War and both novels deal
   with soldiers in the future, Forever Peace is not a direct sequel, and
   takes place on a different future of Earth in the year 2048.

   Using remotely controlled robots called "soldierboys" (which are nearly
   invincible), the Alliance military fights third world guerrillas in an
   endless series of economy-driven wars. As only first world nations
   possess the nanoforge technology that can produce anything from basic
   materials, conflict is largely asymmetric.

   The novel is told partly in first-person narration by the main
   character, Julian Class, and partly by an anonymous third-person
   narrator, who is able to comment on aspects of Julian's personality and
   background.

   The main protagonist, Julian Class, is a physicist and a mechanic who
   operates a soldierboy. Thanks to electronic "jacks" implanted in their
   skulls, mechanics are remotely linked to the machinery as well as to
   each other, being able to experience battle through the machines and
   read the thoughts of other mechanics who are simultaneously jacked in.

   After attempting suicide, Julian and his lover, Amelia "Blaze" Harding,
   are made aware of a problem with an automated particle physics project
   that could potentially trigger a new Big Bang that destroys the Earth
   and the rest of the universe. Because it's so easy to do, it is
   speculated that universes could potentially have only the lifespan of
   the first civilization that attempts such a project. When Julian,
   Blaze, and another physicist submit their paper to a journal's review
   board, they find themselves the target of "The Hammer of God", a
   Christian cult bent on hastening an anticipated end of the universe. As
   the Hammer of God has a secret presence throughout the government,
   Julian and Blaze narrowly miss being assassinated.

   Marty Larrin, one of the inventors of jacking technology, recruits
   Julian and Blaze in an attempt to use the technology to end war for all
   time; a little-known secret is that jacking with someone else for a
   long enough period (about two weeks) will psychologically eliminate the
   ability to kill another human being. By "humanizing" the entire world,
   dangerous technology would not be a problem for human survival. They do
   so, stop the particle accelerator's construction, and the war is
   eventually ended.
