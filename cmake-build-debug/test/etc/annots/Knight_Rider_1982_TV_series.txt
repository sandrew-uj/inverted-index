   Self-made billionaire Wilton Knight rescues police Detective Lieutenant
   Michael Arthur Long after a near fatal shot to the face, giving him a
   new identity (by plastic surgery) and a new name: Michael Knight.
   Wilton selects Michael to be the primary field agent in the pilot
   program of his public justice organization, the Foundation for Law and
   Government (FLAG). The other half of this pilot program is the Knight
   Industries Two Thousand (KITT), a heavily modified, technologically
   advanced Pontiac Firebird Trans Am with numerous features, including an
   extremely durable shell and frame, controlled by a computer with
   artificial intelligence. Michael and KITT are brought in during
   situations where "direct action might provide the only feasible
   solution".

   Heading FLAG is Devon Miles, who provides Michael with directives and
   guidance. Dr. Bonnie Barstow is the chief engineer in charge of KITT's
   care, as well as technical assistant to Devon (April Curtis fills this
   role in Season 2).
