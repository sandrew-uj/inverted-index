   The series follows Jack Stapleton, a medical examiner and pathologist
   who spends most of his free time focusing on various medical cases in
   order to avoid having to think about the deaths of his wife and
   children. He teams up with his co-worker and fellow pathologist Laurie
   Montgomery in order to solve various crimes, with the two eventually
   falling in love and marrying. Laurie was earlier in a relationship with
   Lou Soldano, a police officer and Jack and Laurie's mutual friend.
