   In the 1920s Hemingway lived in Paris as a foreign correspondent for
   the Toronto Star, and traveled to Smyrna to report on the Greco-Turkish
   War. He wanted to use his journalism experience to write fiction,
   believing that a story could be based on real events when a writer
   distilled his own experiences in such a way that, according to
   biographer Jeffrey Meyers, "what he made up was truer than what he
   remembered".

   With his wife Hadley Richardson, Hemingway first visited the Festival
   of San Fermin in Pamplona in 1923, where he was following his recent
   passion for bullfighting. The couple returned to Pamplona in
   1924--enjoying the trip immensely--this time accompanied by Chink
   Dorman-Smith, John Dos Passos, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his
   wife. The two returned a third time in June 1925 and stayed at the
   hotel of his friend Juanito Quintana. That year, they brought with them
   a different group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's
   Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, recently divorced Duff,
   Lady Twysden, her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. Hemingway's
   memory spanning multiple trips might explain the inconsistent timeframe
   in the novel indicating both 1924 and 1925. In Pamplona, the group
   quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, was jealous of
   Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; by the end
   of the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background
   was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ordonez,
   whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ordonez
   honored Hemingway's wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the
   ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the
   Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted
   water.

   Hemingway had intended to write a nonfiction book about bullfighting,
   but then decided that the week's experiences had presented him with
   enough material for a novel. A few days after the fiesta ended, on
   his birthday (21 July), he began writing what would eventually become
   The Sun Also Rises. By 17 August, with 14 chapters written and a
   working title of Fiesta chosen, Hemingway returned to Paris. He
   finished the draft on 21 September 1925, writing a foreword the
   following weekend and changing the title to The Lost Generation.

   A few months later, in December 1925, Hemingway and his wife spent the
   winter in Schruns, Austria, where he began revising the manuscript
   extensively. Pauline Pfeiffer joined them in January, and--against
   Hadley's advice--urged him to sign a contract with Scribner's.
   Hemingway left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the
   publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris, began an affair
   with Pauline. He returned to Schruns to finish the revisions in
   March. In June, he was in Pamplona with both Richardson and
   Pfeiffer. On their return to Paris, Richardson asked for a separation,
   and left for the south of France. In August, alone in Paris,
   Hemingway completed the proofs, dedicating the novel to his wife and
   son. After the publication of the book in October, Hadley asked
   for a divorce; Hemingway subsequently gave her the book's
   royalties.
