   The book is set in the year 1756 during the French and Indian War in
   Guilderland, New York. Ten-year-old Edward Van Alstyne (throughout the
   book, he is called "Ateoord", which is his name in Dutch) and his
   mother Gertrude are determined to protect their home and family with an
   ancient (and much too heavy) Spanish matchlock gun that Edward's
   great-grandfather had brought from Bergen Op Zoom in the Netherlands
   while his father Teunis is away from home with the local militia
   fighting the enemy (using, to Edward's disappointment, a musket instead
   of the matchlock).

   Gertrude, Edward, and his younger sister Trudy go about their everyday
   chores, but news arrives that the French-Indian forces have been
   attacking and burning nearby settlements and that Teunis and his
   militia company have been sent to intercept them. Later that day, while
   she and the children are out herding the cows, Gertrude spots a column
   of smoke in the distance and realizes that raiders are getting closer.
   Rather than take herself and the children over to her mother-in-law's
   brick house as Teunis had previously suggested, since raiders would be
   more likely to attack it rather than their house, she devises a plan
   for a possible Indian attack. Returning home, she loads the matchlock
   gun, fixes it in position to fire and instructs Edward how and when to
   fire it. She then goes outside to keep a watch for any approaching
   raiders.

   At the book's climax, Gertrude sees flames in the distance and realizes
   that her mother-in-law's house has indeed been attacked. Moments later,
   she spots five Indians approaching in the darkness, bent on burning the
   house. Barely able to outrun them, she reaches the front porch and
   manages to shout a pre-arranged warning to Edward, but is wounded in
   the shoulder by a thrown tomahawk, and the boy fires the gun through
   the front window, killing three raiders and driving off the remaining
   two (one of them, apparently wounded, is later killed by the returning
   militia). As their house burns, Edward and Trudy manage to drag their
   unconscious mother to safety. Edward goes back into the burning house
   to save the Spanish gun, and later he, Trudy and their mother are found
   by their father and the other militiamen.

   The book's foreword states that this is a true story handed down from
   Trudy's descendants (Trudy became widely known as an expert spinner,
   having been taught by her mother who, because of her crippled shoulder,
   could no longer perform the task).
