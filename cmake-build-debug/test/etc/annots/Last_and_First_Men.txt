   Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future is a "future
   history" science fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author
   Olaf Stapledon. A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it
   describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two
   billion years^[1] and eighteen distinct human species, of which our own
   is the first. The book employs a narrative conceit that, under subtle
   inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a channelled
   text from the last human species.

   Stapledon's conception of history follows a repetitive cycle with many
   varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over
   millions of years, as the later civilisations rise to far greater
   heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic
   engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind; a
   consciousness composed of many telepathically linked individuals.

   In 1932, Stapledon followed Last and First Men with the far less
   acclaimed Last Men in London. Another Stapledon novel, Star Maker
   (1937), could also be considered a sequel to Last and First Men
   (mentioning briefly man's evolution on Neptune), but is even more
   ambitious in scope, being a history of the entire universe.

   It is the 11th title in the SF Masterworks series.
