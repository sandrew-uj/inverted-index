   Theresa Dunn, a young woman living in New York City, leads a double
   life: by day she is a devoted schoolteacher, but by night she cruises
   singles bars. Eventually, just as she is trying to make a new start,
   Terry is murdered by a young drifter that she has just met and invited
   home.

   Prior to these events, which the book details, Theresa is a child
   suffering from ugly-duckling syndrome, followed by an ordeal as an
   adult in college in which she is engaged in a committed relationship
   with a married man who is using her as a companion. The relationship
   ends, and Theresa experiences a bevy of sexual encounters that are both
   fleeting and pathological.
