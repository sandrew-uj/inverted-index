   Dave Caros, a teenager troublemaker, lost his mother during his birth.
   More recently, his father dies after falling off a roof of a house he
   was helping to build. Always having lived under the shadow of his older
   brother Gideon, he is abandoned by his stepmother Ida while Gideon goes
   to live with his uncle. Ida sends Dave to a Hebrew orphanage, the
   Hebrew Home For Boys.

   When Dave first arrives at the orphanage, he absolutely hates it. The
   bedrooms are cold, the food is awful (and is often stolen by bullies)
   and the superintendent, Mr. Bloom (nicknamed Mr. Doom) is abusive and
   hits the boys with a yardstick. Mr. Doom takes the only thing Dave has
   left from his father, a wood carving of his family boarding Noah's Ark.
   However, Dave enjoys the art lessons and explores his talented,
   creative side.

   Sick of the austere lifestyle, Dave sneaks out of the orphanage in the
   middle of the night and roams the streets of Harlem. He finds a nearby
   party and bumps into Solly, an old man who 'reads cards' to get money.
   He enters the party with Solly and discovers a whole new world of jazz
   music, money and glamour--the Harlem Renaissance. Dave even meets Irma
   Lee, a girl whom he is quickly attracted to. However, Dave needs to
   return to the orphanage every morning, but this new lifestyle isn't
   always what it seems.
