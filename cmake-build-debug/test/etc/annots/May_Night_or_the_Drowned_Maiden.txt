   This story comes from the unnamed story-teller (who was previously
   responsible for "The Fair at Sorochyntsi").

   In this tale, a young Cossack named Levko, the son of the mayor, is in
   love with Hanna. He comes to her house to talk about marriage and
   mentions that his father is not pleased with the idea, though he
   doesn't say anything directly and merely ignores him. As they are
   walking on the outskirts of the village, Hanna asks about an old hut
   with a moss-covered roof and overgrown apple trees surrounding it. He
   tells her the story of a beautiful young girl whose father took care of
   her after her mother died and loved her dearly. Eventually, he married
   another woman who she discovered was a witch when she cut the paw of a
   cat that tried to kill her and her stepmother appeared soon after with
   her hand bandaged. The witch had power over her father, however, and
   eventually she is thrown out of the house and throws herself into the
   nearby pond in despair. She reigns over a group of maidens who also
   drowned in the pond, but once, when she got a hold of the witch as she
   was near the pond, she turned into a maiden and the ghost of the young
   girl has been unable to pick her out of the group ever since, asking
   any young man she comes upon to guess for her.

   As the story progresses Rudy mentions the mayor and a drunk walks into
   his house thinking it is his, tricked by local peasants. Then, his son,
   who is angry at his father for trying to steal Hanna away, and his
   friends decide to play tricks on the village and start to parade around
   causing havoc. They dress up the mayor's sister-in-law, who is assumed
   to be having an affair with him, as a demon with soot all over her
   face, tricking the mayor. He mistakenly throws her into the cellar and
   then finds out it's her, but she gets angry and goes outside, to be
   captured by the boys again and thrown into a hut. Meanwhile, the mayor
   and some of his closest friends decide to find the hooligans and
   instead find the sister-in-law again and almost burn her alive in the
   hut.

   Levko goes on his own and falls asleep near the old house and the pond.
   He becomes enchanted by the calm night and silvery mist surrounding
   everything, and then notices in the pond's reflection that the hut
   appears to be occupied, and a young girl with beautiful skin pops her
   head out of the window. When he turns to look at the hut, it looks as
   empty as ever, but when he comes up to the window the maiden comes out
   and asks him to guess which maiden the witch is in the group. As he
   looks at them, he notices one at first that doesn't seem interested in
   playing games, but determines her to be normal. One, however, seems to
   revel in playing the part of a hawk in their game, and he sees
   blackness in her form, realising she is the witch. The maiden is
   grateful and gives him a note to help him with his father. He wakes up
   and is soon captured by his father and his minions, but still has the
   letter, which he gives to the mayor. The letter seems to be from the
   local commissar, who requests the mayor clean up his village (asking
   several things to be done) as well as allowing his son to marry Hanna.
   The mayor agrees and they will be married in the near future.
