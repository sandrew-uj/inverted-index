   Babylon 5, set primarily between the years 2257 and 2262, depicts a
   future where Earth has a unified Earth government and has gained the
   technology for faster-than-light travel via the use of 'jump gates', a
   kind of wormhole technology allowing transport through the alternate
   dimension of hyperspace. The Colonies within the solar system and
   beyond, make up the Earth Alliance, which has established contact with
   other spacefaring species. Ten years before the series is set, Earth
   barely escaped destruction by the technologically superior Minbari, who
   sought revenge after an Earth starship unwittingly killed their leader
   during first contact, only for them to unexpectedly surrender on the
   brink of victory. Earth has since established peaceful relationships
   with them and the Earth Alliance has become a significant and generally
   respected power within the galactic community.

   Among the other species are the imperialist Centauri; the Narn, who
   only recently gained independence from the Centauri empire; and the
   mysterious, powerful Vorlons. Several dozen less powerful species from
   the League of Non-Aligned Worlds also have diplomatic contact with the
   major races, including the Drazi, Brakiri, Vree, Markab, and pak'ma'ra.
   An ancient and secretive race, the Shadows, unknown to humans but
   documented in many other races' religious texts, malevolently influence
   events to bring chaos and war among the known species.

   The Babylon 5 space station is located in the Epsilon Eridani system,
   at the fifth Lagrangian point of the fictional planet Epsilon III and
   its moon. It is an O'Neill cylinder 5 miles (8.0 km) long and
   0.5-1.0 mile (0.80-1.61 km) in diameter. The station is the last of its
   line; the first three stations were all destroyed during construction,
   while Babylon 4 was completed but mysteriously vanished shortly after
   being made operational. It contains living areas which accommodate
   various alien species, providing differing atmospheres and gravities.
   Human visitors to the alien sectors are shown using breathing equipment
   and other measures to tolerate the conditions.
