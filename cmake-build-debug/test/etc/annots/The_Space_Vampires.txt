   In the late twenty-first century, far out in a nearby asteroid belt, a
   gigantic derelict castle-like alien spacecraft is discovered by the
   space exploration vehicle Hermes, commanded by Captain Olof Carlsen.
   Investigating the spacecraft's interior, the astronauts first discover
   the desiccated corpses of giant bat-like creatures, then three glass
   coffins containing three immobilised humanoids--two male and one
   female--preserved in a state of suspended animation.

   Returning to Earth with the preserved humanoids, Carlsen discovers the
   true nature of the beings when one of them kills a young reporter (and
   the son of a friend of Carlsen) whom Carlsen illicitly allowed to view
   the body. The woman kills her victim by completely draining his
   life-force (a quantifiable energy measured by devices called
   "lambda-field scanners") and when Carlsen attempts to intervene,
   partially draining him of energy as well. Carlsen survives, but is
   unable to prevent the woman from escaping from the hospital.

   Carlsen joins forces with Dr. Hans Fallada, a scientist researching
   energy vampirism and longevity, to find the escaped vampire and
   recapture her. In the course of their investigations they discover that
   the aliens can transfer from one body to another, and that the other
   two have also escaped; they also discover the potential for energy
   vampirism--and more generalised voluntary energy transfer--that exists
   in all humans, and the parallels between vampirism, criminality, and
   sexual fetishisation. At last Carlsen tracks down the vampires in
   London, their leader having possessed the body of the Prime Minister;
   but their confrontation is averted when representatives from the
   Nioth-Korghai,^[5] the vampires' original race, appear and offer the
   vampires (the Ubbo-Sathla,^[5] as they call themselves) the chance to
   regain their original nature as higher-dimension energy-beings. The
   vampires accept joyfully, but destroy themselves upon regaining the
   ability to see themselves for what they had become.

   An epilogue, set nearly a century later, reveals that Carlsen has used
   the techniques of benevolent energy transference he learned via his
   encounters with the vampires to live an extraordinarily long life, and
   possibly (it is implied) to have achieved a kind of transcendence upon
   his death.
