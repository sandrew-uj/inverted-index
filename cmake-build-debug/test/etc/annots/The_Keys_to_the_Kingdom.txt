   Arthur, a young boy, has a severe asthma attack one day as two
   mysterious people, one of which is called Monday, give him a 'Key', a
   magical artifact that saves his life, against Monday's intentions. He
   discovers there exists a world called the 'House', which is split into
   seven parts, each ruled by a 'Trustee', of which Monday is one. A
   divine being known as the 'Architect' has disappeared and left behind a
   'Will', leaving the House and the seven Keys to her seven Trustees, but
   the Trustees have split up the Will and hidden the parts, intent on not
   letting the Will be fulfilled.

   The first part of the Will has managed to break free and, by
   convenience, chosen Arthur as the 'rightful heir' who must recover the
   other lost parts of the Will; this has led to Monday giving up half of
   his Key to him. In the first book, Arthur defeats Monday and takes
   control of the first part of the House. Books two to five follow a
   somewhat regular pattern: in each, Arthur tries to gain control over
   one part of the House, and ultimately succeeds after various
   challenges, setting free one part of the Will. Each book features one
   main antagonist, usually the Trustee of that part of the House, with
   the exception of one Trustee who wants the Will to be fulfilled but has
   been overthrown by the other Trustees. Sometimes, the Trustees sow
   chaos on Earth while he is away in the House.

   One important recurring part of the story is Arthur limiting his use of
   the powerful Keys, as using them too much will turn him into an
   immortal, and the presence of an immortal on Earth causes harm.

   At the end of the sixth book, Arthur has freed the sixth part of the
   Will but not yet claimed that part of the House, and the sixth Trustee
   is busy invading the domain of the seventh Trustee. In the seventh
   book, Arthur ultimately manages to free the last part of the Will, but
   then everything is destroyed and Arthur faces the divine being known as
   the 'Architect', who explains that the true purpose of the Will was to
   let her die and hand over the responsibility of being Architect to him.
   Having become the new Architect, he recreates the universe as it was,
   though the House will be made anew. He splits himself into the
   Architect and a human Arthur, whom he sends back to Earth.
