   Galactic Patrol introduces Kimball Kinnison, who will be the hero of
   the next three books - Gray Lensman, Second Stage Lensmen and (to a
   lesser extent) Children of the Lens. Kinnison and Clarissa MacDougall
   are the penultimates of the human breeding program the Arisians set up
   many eons earlier.

   The book deals with the earliest stages of Kinnison's career, starting
   with his graduation as a Lensman from the Patrol's academy. Organized
   pirates, known as Boskonians, have gained a great advantage with a new
   type of space drive, making their ships far faster than anything the
   Patrol can build. That is, with the exception of one ship, the
   Britannia. New and experimental, built to be the fastest thing in
   space, she has abandoned the traditional ray armament of a space ship
   for an offensive weapon much older - explosive artillery, fired at an
   opponent held in place by unbreakable tractor beams. Her mission is to
   capture a Boskonian ship of the new type intact enough to get the
   secret of her speed (hence the artillery, which the scientists of the
   patrol think can damage another ship enough to disable it without
   destroying the information they require). The experimental nature of
   her weapon means that she would be useless to a man experienced only in
   using the standard weapons of the time, so she is given to the
   inexperienced Kinnison to command.

   Kinnison is successful in capturing a ship, but must flee the
   converging pirate raiders. Much of the first third of the book is taken
   up with his efforts to evade his pursuers and return the priceless
   information to Tellus (Earth). In the process, Kinnison finds and frees
   a previously unknown, mentally enslaved race (the Velantians) from
   their masters (the Delgonian overlords), making valuable allies and
   adding a new member race to civilization. He also destroys several
   pirate ships, completely frustrates the main villain of the book
   "Helmuth speaking for Boskone" and deduces the location of one of the
   pirates' secret bases.

   Kinnison successfully returns to Earth in a captured pirate ship and is
   promoted to the exalted rank of Unattached Lensman. Unattached Lensmen
   (commonly called "Gray Lensmen" because their uniform is made of plain
   gray leather) are endowed with virtually unlimited power and authority.
   He immediately sets out to infiltrate what he believes to be an
   important pirate base. Unfortunately, Kinnison is in over his head and
   the telepathically capable "Wheelmen" who man the base discover and
   almost kill him before he can escape. While in the hospital recovering,
   Kinnison is assigned the pretty, but tough, nurse Clarissa MacDougall.
   He behaves badly and is rude and condescending to her, blindly lashing
   out because he blames himself for his abject failure with the Wheelmen.
   Kinnison, once recovered, goes to Arisia to learn how better to use his
   Lens. Kinnison is the first Lensman to be accepted for further training
   by the Arisians, and leaves weeks later many times stronger and with
   numerous additional capabilities. He is now a Second Stage Lensman.

   For practice, Kinnison tries out these capabilities by infiltrating a
   Patrol base and trying to control the mind of a base member from a
   distance. After he reveals himself to the base commander, he is asked
   to judge a murder case that the local authorities have been unable to
   solve. He then reads the minds of the two accused men, finds which one
   is guilty, and using his mental powers, executes the culprit.

   Using the information that Kinnison brought back about the new space
   drive, the Galactic Patrol quickly rebuilds its ships and goes out
   pirate hunting again. The Boskonians are being beaten back with the new
   ships when suddenly all Boskonian ships disappear from space. When they
   appear again, they have also been rebuilt and are now equal to the best
   that Civilization has to offer. The bloody war goes on. Every time
   Boskone and Civilization meet, ships and men die but neither side can
   gain a decisive advantage.

   Kinnison locates the headquarters of Helmuth who "speaks for Boskone"
   and, with the help of the Grand Fleet of the Galactic Patrol, destroys
   it and kills Helmuth.
