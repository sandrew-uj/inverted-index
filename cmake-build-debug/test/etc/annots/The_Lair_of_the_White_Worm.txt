   The central character of the book is Adam Salton, an Australian at the
   outset living there, who in 1860 is contacted by his elderly
   great-uncle, Richard Salton, a landed gentleman of Lesser Hill,
   Derbyshire, England, who has no other family and wants to
   establish a relationship with the only other living member of the
   Salton family. Although Adam has already made his own fortune in
   Australia, he enthusiastically agrees to meet his uncle, and on his
   arrival by ship at Southampton the two men quickly become good friends.
   His great-uncle then reveals that he wishes to make Adam the heir to
   his estate, Lesser Hill. Adam travels there and quickly finds himself
   at the centre of mysterious events, with Sir Nathaniel de Salis, a
   friend of Richard Salton's, as his guide.

   Edgar Caswall, the new heir to a neighbouring estate, Castra Regis or
   Royal Camp, is in the process of making a mesmeric assault on a local
   girl, Lilla Watford. Meanwhile, Arabella March, of Diana's Grove, is
   running a game of her own, perhaps angling to become Mrs. Edgar
   Caswall. He is a slightly pathological eccentric and has inherited
   Franz Mesmer's chest, which he keeps in the Castra Regis Tower. Caswall
   seeks to make use of mesmerism, associated with Mesmer, a precursor to
   hypnotism, is obsessed with Lilla, and attempts to break her using
   mesmeric powers. However, with the help of Lilla's cousin, Mimi
   Watford, he is thwarted time and again.

   Caswall has a giant kite built in the shape of a hawk to scare away
   pigeons which have attacked his fields and destroyed his crops. For
   lack of anything better to do, he obsessively watches the kite and
   begins to believe that it has a mind of its own and that he himself is
   a god.

   Adam Salton finds black snakes on his great uncle's property and buys a
   mongoose to hunt them down. He then discovers a child who has been
   bitten on the neck and who almost dies as a result. Adam learns that
   another child has already been killed by a snake bite, and that animals
   have also been killed mysteriously throughout the county.

   Caswall's African servant, Oolanga, a man obsessed with death and
   torture, prowls around the Castra Regis estate, enjoying the carnage
   left by the White Worm. Adam's mongoose attacks Arabella, who shoots it
   to death. Adam buys more mongooses and keeps them locked in trunks when
   not using them to hunt. Arabella tears another mongoose apart with her
   hands. Oolanga takes a liking to Arabella, perhaps sensing something
   violent in her, and makes advances. Arabella scorns Oolanga and is
   deeply insulted that he would dare to approach her. In an attempt to
   win her over, Oolanga steals one of Adam's trunks (which he believes is
   filled with treasure, but is actually just another mongoose), and Adam
   follows Oolanga. Arabella lures Oolanga to a deep well in her house,
   then in rage and disgust murders him by dragging him down into the deep
   pit tunnelled through a bed of white china clay. Adam witnesses the
   murder, but has no evidence of it apart from his own word. Arabella
   writes him a letter the next day, with the previous night's events
   twisted, claiming her complete innocence. Adam and Sir Nathaniel begin
   to suspect that Arabella is guilty of other crimes and that she wants
   to murder Mimi Watford.

   Adam and Sir Nathaniel then plot to stop Arabella by whatever means
   necessary. Sir Nathaniel is a Van Helsing-type character who wants to
   hunt down Arabella, who he believes, with increasing conviction, is the
   White Worm of legend.

   The White Worm is a large snake-like creature dwelling deep under
   Arabella's house at Diana's Grove. It has green glowing eyes and feeds
   on whatever living creatures it can find to eat. Sir Nathaniel believes
   the Worm is descended from dragons, who traded their physical power for
   cunning. The Worm ascends from its pit and seeks to attack Adam and
   Mimi Watford in the forest of Diana's Grove.

   Adam is able to foil Arabella's multiple attempts to murder Mimi, and
   Arabella offers to sell Diana's Grove, which Adam buys with the aim of
   destroying the White Worm. He plans to fill the pit with sand and set
   dynamite to kill the Worm while it is underground.

   Caswall's last visit to Lilla ends in her death. In the final chapters,
   Mimi Watford confronts Caswall who has finally succumbed to madness. He
   lures her onto the roof of Castra Regis House as a storm approaches and
   shows off his kite, despite the thunderheads building in the sky.
   Arabella, who had been stalking Mimi, watches from nearby and steals
   some of the wire holding the kite, apparently unspooling it all the way
   back to her house. When Mimi discovers Caswall has locked her onto the
   roof she shoots off the lock with a gun Adam gave her for her
   protection and flees home. Adam convinces her to go back outside with
   him, and they witness the following events: a massive thunderstorm
   breaks over Castra Regis House, a lightning bolt is grounded by the
   kite and demolishes the Castra Regis tower; it then travels through the
   wire Arabella had run to Diana's Grove and ignites Adam's dynamite,
   which pulverizes the White Worm and destroys the house and Arabella at
   the same time. After this, Adam and Mimi Watford are married.
