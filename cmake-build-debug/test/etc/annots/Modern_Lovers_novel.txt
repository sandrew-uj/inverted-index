   Modern Lovers follows Elizabeth, Andrew, and Henry Marx, a family
   living in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, and their friends Zoe, Jane, and Ruby
   Kahn-Bennet over the course of a full summer. Elizabeth, Andrew, and
   Zoe met at Oberlin College in the 1980s and formed a punk rock group
   called Kitty's Mustache with their mutual friend, Lydia Greenbaum.
   During this period of time, Elizabeth wrote the lyrics to a song,
   called, "Mistress of Myself," which the band often played. The band
   dissolved when Lydia chose to quit school and begin her own music
   career. Lydia's private rendition of, "Mistress of Myself," was wildly
   successful, and she soon became a major star, eventually dying of a
   drug overdose at 27. After Lydia's departure from Oberlin,
   Elizabeth, Andrew, and Zoe graduated and moved to Ditmas Park, where
   they began to form families of their own. Her death years later
   impacted each of them in a unique way.

   In the present day, Elizabeth is working as a real estate agent, Zoe as
   the co-owner of a restaurant, Hyacinth, and Andrew is trying to figure
   out his next career. All three are struggling with middle age. Zoe
   is frustrated with the lack of passion in her marriage to a woman named
   Jane, and not for the first time, begins to contemplate divorce. Jane,
   on the other hand, wishes to work on the relationship instead of giving
   up. Both are concerned with Elizabeth's not-quite-platonic
   relationship with Zoe. While working through their marital strife,
   Zoe and Jane attempt to encourage their daughter, Ruby, a recent high
   school graduate, to retake the SAT's in order to improve her results
   enough to get into college. Ruby, completely disinterested, agrees
   to take an SAT preparatory class. There, Ruby and Henry, Elizabeth and
   Andrew's son, begin to bond and eventually start to date, developing a
   fast and furious summer romance. In contrast, through co-managing
   Hyacinth, Zoe and Jane begin to rekindle their relationship and
   rediscover their lost passion through their mutual love of food.

   Elizabeth and Andrew tackle their own share of marital struggles during
   the course of the novel. Elizabeth wrestles with the concept of feeling
   passive in the development of her own life, while Andrew, never able to
   create his own career, feels the loss of youth so acutely he becomes
   involved with a new, cultish organization formed down the street from
   their house. Called EVOLVEment, the organization operates out
   of a run-down house which they use as part yoga studio, part juice
   bar. Operating without permits or licenses, the endeavor is
   completely illegal, unbeknownst to Andrew for most of the novel.
   Andrew's involvement with EVOLVEment begins to strain his relationship
   with Elizabeth, which is further compounded by Elizabeth's desire to
   help a producer create a film about Lydia, while Andrew, harboring a
   secret about the former star, wants to leave the past alone. These
   conflicts leave both characters debating the sustainability of their
   relationship, as well as how they ended up together in the first
   place.
