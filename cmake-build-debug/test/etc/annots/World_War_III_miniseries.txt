   The miniseries begins in 1987. At the height of the Cold War, two U.S.
   Air Force Airmen monitor their radar screens at a quiet and remote
   NORAD facility in Alaska. Suddenly, one of the radar operators notices
   an unidentified aircraft sneaking in on the leading edge of a weather
   front. He alerts his partner about the threat and begins to contact
   Elmendorf AFB. The other Airman retrieves a silenced Mac-10 from his
   desk and kills him. He then proceeds to shoot the remaining station
   personnel while they are sleeping in their bunks. Lighting a cigarette,
   the traitor notifies Elmendorf that the station will be out of
   commission for the next hour in order to repair a malfunctioning
   generator. It's later learned that the traitor was a deep cover K.G.B.
   operative who'd been in the Air Force for 15 years. The necessary blind
   spot has been created in the radar for the plane to continue unabated
   into Alaska.

   Out of the plane, the Soviets launch a secret incursion into Alaska.
   The Soviets have inserted a cold weather Spetsnaz assault force of
   approximately 35-40 KGB desant ski troops led by Soviet Colonel
   Alexander Vorashin (Jeroen Krabbe) into northern Alaska with a
   track-driven armored vehicle. Vorashin's orders are to seize control of
   a strategically located pumping station along the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
   so as to threaten placement of floating explosive devices in the stream
   of oil and destroy substantial portions of the pipeline. This operation
   is being conducted in response to America's grain embargo of the Soviet
   Union; just as the 1980 grain embargo was in response to the 1979
   Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. The governments of Canada, Australia,
   and Argentina have joined the U.S. in the embargo. This has caused
   severe food shortages and domestic unrest inside the Soviet Union. A
   squad of 18 lightly armed soldiers of the Alaska Army National Guard
   and Alaskan Scouts, who are on a training exercise, are discovered,
   ambushed, and killed by the Soviet invaders. At Fort Wainwright,
   Colonel Jake Caffey (David Soul), a combat veteran of the Vietnam War,
   is sent by his commanding officer to locate the soldiers, who are 24
   hours late in reporting back in from the training exercise. Caffey
   flies to the National Guard temporary patrol base to meet with the
   other half of the Guard company. Caffey goes out on a search mission
   and discovers one on the Alaskan Scouts still alive and learns of the
   Soviet incursion. Caffey then shadows the Soviet troops after notifying
   Ft Wainwright Commander, General Roberts. The General flies to the
   scene only to be seen by the Soviets. Caffey takes command of the
   Guardsmen when his senior officer Gen. Roberts, who did not believe the
   news of the invading Soviet troops, is killed in Caffey's first
   firefight with the Soviets. Caffey notifies the Pentagon by radio of
   the situation.

   Upon learning of the situation, the U.S. President Thomas McKenna (Rock
   Hudson) orders Caffey's National Guard troops to be federalized and
   orders Caffey to do all he can to stop the Soviet troops. The President
   orders a media blackout on the emergency but then orders U.S. forces to
   be mobilized in response to the Soviet incursion, under the pretext of
   unscheduled training exercises. The President fears that the people of
   the United States will demand a declaration of war against the Russians
   for this attack. Fierce winter weather is preventing U.S. military
   units from bases and forts in southern Alaska from reinforcing Caffey's
   unit. Caffey deduces the Soviet assault unit's goal. He uses the two
   U.S. Army helicopters at his disposal to move his unit to a new pumping
   station ahead of the Soviets.

   Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Soviet Premier Gorny (Brian Keith) has
   learned that the Soviet military and KGB leadership have executed this
   plan without his permission. He is informed of the U.S. mobilization
   and he orders Soviet forces to a similar posture. In Alaska, Colonel
   Caffey realizes that his men have an inadequate supply of ammunition,
   grenades and mines. Utilizing combat tactics that he learned in the
   Vietnam War, he sets up a defensive perimeter around the pumping
   station making use of surplus lengths of large-bore oil pipe to
   establish a position from which to ambush the enemy. The Soviet troops
   approach the pumping station, unaware of the American soldiers'
   presence until they trigger U.S. land mines buried in the snow. The
   Soviets suffer casualties and fall back, but continue to surround the
   buildings. The U.S. President and Soviet Premier secretly meet in
   Iceland to negotiate an end to the crisis. They are unable to reach an
   agreement and both return to their countries, but promise each other
   that talks will continue.

   America responds to the Soviets' continuing mobilizations, as officials
   recognize they are consistent with a fictional contingency plan called
   Krasnyj Flag or "Red Flag." The U.S. President orders all American
   ballistic missile submarines, surface warships, B-1s, and B-52s to
   deploy in readiness for war. He directs U.S. bombers to fly continuous
   paths just outside Soviet airspace. Colonel Caffey and his soldiers
   continue to repel the Soviet attacks on the pumping station, but his
   soldiers are running low on ammunition and supplies. President McKenna
   contacts Caffey by radio and asks him and his soldiers to hold out at
   all costs, hoping that the weather will break so that reinforcements
   can be sent to relieve them. McKenna still holds out hope for a
   diplomatic solution. Premier Gorny also hopes for a negotiated
   settlement to the crisis. However, hardline, pro-Soviet members of the
   Communist Party and the KGB--who remain incensed by the food
   shortage--suddenly launch a coup d'etat. They use a car bomb to
   assassinate Gorny while he is visiting the school attended by his young
   son, Sasha.

   In the meantime, the Soviet troops in Alaska launch a final assault on
   the pumping station. Soviet Colonel Vorashin, however, has become
   concerned about the rapidly-growing prospect of a nuclear war, and
   requests a parley with Caffey. After an emotional conversation,
   Vorashin and Caffey agree to discontinue the fighting. However, at that
   moment, the Soviet K.G.B. Communist Party Political Officer Maj Nicolai
   Samaaretz hurls a grenade, which presumably kills both men.

   The situation collapses in bloodshed, with a sergeant of the Alaskan
   Scouts managing to send one final message that the last American
   position is being overrun. Receiving this news, President McKenna calls
   the Soviet leadership and discovers that Gorny is unavailable to speak
   with him. The Soviet leadership claims Gorny has been felled by severe
   intestinal flu and that their forces will withdraw to pre-crisis
   positions, but McKenna does not believe them and realizes that pro-war
   elements of the KGB are seizing control of the Soviet Union. Once the
   telephone conference ends, McKenna submits to the National Security
   Council his belief that Gorny has been killed and that total war is
   imminent. He is correct, for at that moment, the coup leaders decide on
   an all-out nuclear strike, some of them mistakenly believing that U.S.
   law requires the President to obtain Congressional approval before an
   American nuclear attack. But President McKenna has already deduced the
   enemy strategy. Horrified and nearly in tears, he concludes the
   situation is unrecoverable, and orders a full nuclear counterstrike
   upon the Soviet Union.
