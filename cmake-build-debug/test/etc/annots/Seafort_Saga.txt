   Nicholas Seafort is a seventeen-year-old midshipman who boards the UNS
   Hibernia on his first space assignment, a three-year interstellar
   voyage to the colonies of Hope Nation and Detour. He beats back a
   challenge to his authority as senior midshipman by Vax Holser, the next
   most senior. During the trip, he strikes up friendships with Third
   Lieutenant Harv Malstrom and an attractive passenger, Amanda Frowel.

   A disastrous rescue of a passenger injured while sightseeing on the
   wreck of another ship results in the deaths of Captain Haag and his two
   senior lieutenants, elevating Malstrom to the captaincy and Seafort to
   second-in-command of Hibernia. When Maelstrom falls ill with a
   quick-acting cancer, Seafort, believing himself to be unqualified to
   command, begs him to promote Holser to lieutenant, but Maelstrom dies
   without doing so.

   The other surviving officers (outside the chain of command) share
   Seafort's opinion of his leadership abilities and try to get him to
   relieve himself, but he cannot find any regulations that permit it.
   They back down when Seafort points out the penalty for mutiny.

   Seafort is immediately faced with a difficult decision. Malstrom had
   condemned three crewmen to death for assaulting the sergeant-at-arms in
   an attempt to conceal their drug-making operation. Their punishment was
   extremely unpopular with the rest of the crew. However, despite the
   danger of a revolt, Seafort has two of the men hanged; the third's
   sentence is commuted to several months' confinement. His resolute
   handling of the situation quells the unruly crewmen. This action
   estranges him from Amanda, who feels the executions to be barbaric.

   Other dangers follow. By thoroughness and sheer stubbornness, Seafort
   discovers that the ship's sentient computer, Darla, has been corrupted
   by careless naval programmers and would have sent the ship hopelessly
   off-course on the next leg of their journey. Darla was also responsible
   for the explosion that killed Captain Haag. To fix the problem, Seafort
   has a backup restored.

   When the ship arrives at its next stop, Miningcamp, a small mining
   colony in an otherwise uninhabitable system, mutineers from the space
   station try to take over the ship. Seafort single-handedly holds them
   off until the crew can regroup and deal with the intruders. Eventually,
   Seafort ends the rebellion and finds out the cause. An ore barge and
   the starship Telstar are long overdue, which resulted in the panic that
   led to the trouble.

   When the Hibernia reaches Hope Nation, Seafort expects to be relieved,
   but discovers that not only has the admiral in command of the naval
   garrison died in a strange viral epidemic, but a captain has deserted,
   leaving a Hope Nation commanding officer who is junior to Seafort.
   Seafort finds himself in charge of all naval forces in the system.
   During a tour of the planet, Seafort, Amanda (with whom he has
   reconciled) and one of his officers run into the officer who had
   deserted. He is hiding in the mountains with his wife because he
   believes he saw meteors spraying something in the sky shortly before
   the epidemic broke out. Believing the man to be mad, Seafort dismisses
   his story as fantasy, but does not force the couple to return to
   civilization.

   Seafort recruits several officers from the local personnel, then
   continues on to the next stop, Detour. He finds that two of the new men
   are poor officers, dumped on him by their former commanders. However,
   he manages to deal with the situation.

   Then Hibernia's sensors detect the Telstar, adrift in space with
   massive rents in her hull. Seafort leads a boarding party to
   investigate and, to his horror, encounters a strange alien life form
   resembling an amoeba in the ship's corridor. When it attacks, it
   becomes clear that it was responsible for the disabling of the Telstar
   and the death of its crew. Fortunately, Seafort is able to escape
   unharmed. After a stop at Hope Nation to warn the residents, Seafort
   takes Hibernia back to Earth to report the news.
