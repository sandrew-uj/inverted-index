   Four years after the events of Moon-Flash, Kyreol has trained in the
   Dome city to be a space pilot, while her friend Terje becomes a
   hunter-observer. Alternating chapters follow Kyreol into space and
   Terje back to their original primitive home on Riverworld. When Kyreol
   crash lands on a Niade moon, her adventure becomes a struggle for
   survival dominated by an ancient, abandoned white city; meanwhile,
   Terje takes on the role of Healer in their old community after Kyreol's
   father dies. By reestablishing her place there by painting her portrait
   on a ritual cave wall, he prepares the way for her return.
