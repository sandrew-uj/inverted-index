   A belief is spreading in conquered China that the government has lost
   the Mandate of Heaven. Han Tzu meets up with Mazer Rackham, who passes
   him a blow dart pen, calling it the "Mandate of Heaven". Han Tzu
   confronts the emperor, Snow Tiger, who is shot and killed by a guard,
   allowing Han Tzu to overthrow the Chinese government and install
   himself as the new emperor. Meanwhile, Peter Wiggin, Hegemon of Earth,
   along with Petra Arkanian, goes to visit Alai, Caliph of the Muslim
   League. The two help Alai realize that he is little more than a
   glorified prisoner, and that others have been ruling Islam in his
   stead. After uncovering a conspiracy against him, Alai resolves to take
   firmer control of his nation and guarantee the human rights of his
   subjugated peoples.

   The rest of the book deals with Peter Wiggin working to create a world
   government free of war through his Free People of Earth (FPE) alliance.
   Caliph Alai of the Muslim League and Virlomi, now the virtual goddess
   of India, oppose his efforts. Against this backdrop of world political
   machinations by the former Battle School children is the extremely
   personal story of Julian (Bean) Delphiki. Anton's Key is making him
   grow at an astounding rate and he has only a short time before his body
   will become too large for his heart to support. He searches frantically
   for his and Petra's missing children. Graff assists them in locating
   the surrogate mothers of their children. While Bean and Petra wait for
   news, Graff extends invitations to the other members of Ender's Jeesh
   to leave Earth and rule colonies, where they can conquer to their
   heart's content without causing needless wars between themselves, and
   instructs Bean to support Peter in forming the FPE.

   The FPE alliance begins with only twenty-two countries, among them
   Brazil, Rwanda, and the Netherlands. The first test of the FPE comes
   when they recognize the sovereignty and nationhood of the Nubian,
   Quechua, and Aymara peoples, ethnic minorities that are politically
   part of other nations. Peru and Sudan send troops against these "rebel"
   strongholds, but Peter defends them using Bean and Suriyawong, leading
   Rwandan and Thai troops, to show that war against one FPE member is war
   against all of them. The FPE's victories, and especially their
   militarily brilliant commanders, bolster support for the FPE, and
   nations begin to freely vote on whether to join it.

   Meanwhile, Bean suspects that Peter is embezzling Ender's military
   pension to fund the FPE, so he requests that Ender's funds be placed
   under the control of an autonomous computer. Colonel Graff has the Mind
   Game reprogrammed to accurately predict financial markets and turns it
   loose over the ansible network, where it continues to invest Ender's
   pension and, as revealed later in the Enderverse chronology, eventually
   evolves into the artificial intelligence known as Jane. The Mind Game
   also speeds the search for Bean's missing children, allowing the
   International Fleet to find eight of them; two of whom have Anton's Key
   turned, as does the baby Petra is carrying. The ninth remains
   undetected, as Achilles had it implanted into a woman named Randi,
   brainwashed to think that it is the baby of Achilles, whom she worships
   as a hero assassinated by foul enemies. To avoid persecution, Randi
   determines to leave Earth and live in a colony, where she can raise her
   child (who appears to have Anton's Key turned, as the baby is born
   prematurely) to follow in Achilles' footsteps. Her story, and that of
   her child Randall Firth, is concluded in Card's later novel Ender in
   Exile.

   Virlomi attempts to guarantee India's freedom via dynastic marriage,
   turning down an offer from Han Tzu to instead attempt to seduce Peter
   Wiggin. When Peter turns her down, she turns to Alai whom she finds
   easier to outmaneuver. Their new marriage is fraught with tension and
   Alai discovers that, despite his wife's status as an infidel and a
   woman, the more hotheaded members of his empire actually prefer her
   aggressive and expansionist policies. Virlomi then declares war on
   China, setting off all manner of plots: Muslim hardliners attempt to
   assassinate Alai; Russia invades China and eastern Europe using
   "contingency" plans drawn up by a horrified Vlad; and Fly Molo of the
   Philippines is instructed to invade Taiwan, his nation suicidally
   confident in their Jeesh member. In this way, all the Battle School
   grads are convinced to take up Graff's offer to travel the stars,
   realizing that their presence on Earth guarantees continued and
   wasteful war. Even Virlomi agrees, after Suri manages to snap her out
   of her growing megalomania.

   With the secret help of Mazer Rackham, Bean divorces Petra for her own
   sake, takes the three found children with Anton's Key, and flies away
   on a starship provided by the Fleet to achieve relativistic speeds and
   thereby stay alive long enough for medical researchers to find a cure.
   Bean's departure breaks Petra's heart, but she becomes Peter's military
   commander, eventually marrying and having five children with him,
   though she never stops loving Bean. By the end of the novel, all of the
   world's nations, except the United States, have joined the FPE. Peter
   reconciles with Ender via ansible, giving the "Speaker for the Dead"
   all he needs to write The Hegemon, a deeply felt and truthful biography
   of his brother. Petra reads his biography at his grave, thinking of him
   as the man who truly changed her life. Still, Bean remains the one who
   she loves and has changed her life the most.^[1]
