   In the 22nd century, rising sea levels from global warming have wiped
   out coastal cities, reducing the world's population. Mecha, humanoid
   robots seemingly capable of complex thought but lacking in emotions,
   have been created.

   In Madison, New Jersey, David, a prototype Mecha child capable of
   experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose
   son Martin contracted a rare disease and has been placed in suspended
   animation. Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him
   and activates his imprinting protocol, causing him to have an enduring,
   childlike love for her. David seeks to have Monica express the same
   love towards him. He also befriends Teddy, Martin's robotic teddy bear.
   Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home. Martin
   becomes jealous of David, and taunts him to perform worrisome acts,
   such as cutting off locks of Monica's hair while she is sleeping. At a
   pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife,
   triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs onto Martin,
   and they both fall into the pool. Martin is saved before he drowns, and
   Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators to be destroyed.
   On the way there, Monica has a change of heart and spares David from
   destruction by leaving him in the woods. With Teddy as his only
   companion, David recalls The Adventures of Pinocchio and decides to
   find the Blue Fairy so that she may turn him into a real boy, which he
   believes will win back Monica's love.

   David and Teddy are captured by a Flesh Fair, where obsolete Mecha are
   destroyed before jeering crowds. David is nearly destroyed himself and
   pleads for his life. The audience, deceived by David's realistic
   nature, revolts and allows David to escape alongside Gigolo Joe, a male
   prostitute Mecha on the run from authorities after being framed for
   murder. David, Teddy and Joe go to the decadent resort town of Rouge
   City, where "Dr. Know", a holographic answer engine, directs them to
   the top of Rockefeller Center in the flooded ruins of Manhattan and has
   also provided fairy tale information interpreted by David as suggesting
   that a Blue Fairy has the power to help him. Above the ruins of
   Manhattan, David meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells him that
   their meeting demonstrates David's ability to love and desire. David
   finds many copies of himself, including a female variant Darlene, boxed
   and ready to be shipped. Disheartened by his lost sense of
   individuality, David attempts suicide by falling from a skyscraper into
   the ocean. While underwater, David catches sight of a figure resembling
   the Blue Fairy before Joe rescues him in an amphibious aircraft. Before
   David can explain, Joe is captured via electromagnet by authorities.
   David and Teddy take control of the aircraft to see the Fairy, which
   turns out to be a statue from an attraction on Coney Island. The two
   become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle. Believing
   the Blue Fairy to be real, David asks the statue to turn him into a
   real boy, and repeats this request until his internal power source is
   depleted.

   Two thousand years later, humans are extinct and Manhattan is buried
   under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced form, and a
   group of them called the Specialists have become interested in learning
   about humanity. They find and revive David and Teddy. David walks to
   the frozen Blue Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The
   Specialists reconstruct the Swinton family home from David's memories
   and explain to him, via an interactive image of the Blue Fairy, that it
   is impossible to make David a real boy. However, at David's insistence
   they use their scientific knowledge to recreate Monica through genetic
   material from the strand of hair that Teddy kept. This Monica can live
   for only one day, and the process cannot be repeated. David spends his
   happiest day with Monica, and as she falls asleep in the evening, she
   tells David that she has always loved him: "the everlasting moment he
   had been waiting for", the narrator says; "David falls asleep as well
   and goes to that place 'where dreams are born.'"
