   Tallis Keeton, the younger sister of Harry Keeton (from Mythago Wood),
   is the protagonist of the story. Lavondyss starts with Tallis's
   grandfather and his efforts to write down some of his encounters with
   the mythagos from the nearby Ryhope Wood; Tallis is still a baby at
   this point. The story soon jumps forward a few years to where Tallis
   and her development are concentrated upon - it is at this point that
   the story shows her developing relationship with the land around her
   house and the mythagos emerging from Ryhope wood. This development
   continues throughout the book as periods in her life from baby to child
   to teenager to young woman are shown to the reader. As Tallis'
   shamanistic powers grow, she undertakes a quest in Ryhope wood to find
   her lost brother and undergoes a metamorphosis of her own.
