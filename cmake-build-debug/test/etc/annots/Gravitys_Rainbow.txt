   Launch of a V-2 rocket

   Part 1: "Beyond the Zero": The opening pages of the novel follow Pirate
   Prentice, an employee of the Special Operations Executive, first in his
   dreams, and later around the house in wartime London that he shares
   with several others in the S.O.E. He soon is driven to the site of a
   V-2 rocket strike. Pirate's associate Teddy Bloat photographs a map
   depicting the sexual encounters of U.S. Army Lt. Tyrone Slothrop, an
   employee of a fictional technical intelligence unit, ACHTUNG. Slothrop
   and his background are detailed through discussions by some of his
   co-workers and through references to his family's past history,
   reaching back to early colonial times, in the Berkshire Mountains of
   western Massachusetts. (There are loose parallels to Pynchon's own
   family history.) Slothrop's (fictional) home town of Mingeborough is
   mentioned for the first time (although the town and a young boy named
   Hogan Slothrop had previously been featured in Pynchon's short story,
   "The Secret Integration"). That family setting will be mentioned
   several times much later in the novel, following the family's decline
   over time within a Puritan legacy of sterility and death.

   Employees of a fictional top secret psychological warfare agency called
   PISCES, headquartered at a former insane asylum known as "The White
   Visitation", investigate Slothrop's map of his presumed sexual
   encounters in London, finding that each location appears to precede a
   V-2 rocket strike in the same place by several days. This coincidence
   intrigues Pavlovian behavioral psychologist Edward W. Pointsman, who
   thinks there may be a direct causal relationship between Slothrop's
   erections and the missile strikes, and his associate, statistician
   Roger Mexico, who suggests that the relationship is only a random
   coincidence of probabilities, as seen in Poisson Distributions, leading
   to further reflections in this section and later on topics as broad as
   the occult, Determinism, the reverse flow of time, and the sexuality of
   the rocket itself. Pointsman is all the more intrigued to find that as
   a baby Slothrop had been subjected to behavioral experiments conducted
   by a Dr. Laszlo Jamf that involved the stimulation of his penis to
   erections.

   Many characters not significant until later are introduced in "Beyond
   the Zero", including one of Dr. Jamf's former students, Franz Poekler,
   a German engineer who has worked on early German experiments in
   rocketry and later on the V-2 rocket, and Poekler's wife Leni, a former
   student radical. Others who appear significant in Part One, such as
   Pointsman's associate Thomas Gwenhidwy and Roger Mexico's girlfriend
   Jessica Swanlake, vanish from the narrative and don't re-appear until
   much later. Indeed, most of the 400 named characters only make single
   appearances, serving merely to demonstrate the sheer scope of Pynchon's
   universe. Character names sometimes consist of outrageous puns (such as
   "Joaquin Stick") but may also relate to particular traits of that
   character or to themes within the novel. Some names of historical
   characters also have thematic relevance. Under the influence of sodium
   amytal administered through Pointsman's maneuvers, Slothrop has a
   hallucinatory flashback to a scene in Boston's Roxbury district.
   References here include "Red, the Negro shoeshine boy," who will much
   later be known as the Black Power leader Malcolm X, and jazz
   saxophonist Charlie "Yardbird" Parker, both of whom represent a threat
   to white racism. Another fictional character, Katje Borgesius, is
   contacted in this section by Pirate in order is to bring her to safety
   from the Continent to England. Katje had been a Dutch double agent who
   infiltrated a V-2 rocket-launching battery commanded by a sadistic SS
   officer named Captain Blicero. Blicero had kept Katje and a young
   soldier named Gottfried as sex slaves in a perverse enactment of the
   Hansel and Gretel story. However, Blicero (a Teutonic name connoting
   Death) is also revealed to be the code name of a former Lieutenant
   Weissman ("White Man") who earlier appeared in Pynchon's first novel,
   V. He has had an ongoing but now-severed relationship with Enzian, a
   Herero he had brought to Germany from German South West Africa (now
   Namibia), and who is the leader of a group of Herero rocket technicians
   known as the Schwarzkommando, who had been helping Blicero in his own
   project to create and fire a rocket. Katje, on the other hand, will
   come under Pointsman's control in England, while, as the Christmas
   season ends, Roger Mexico worries about losing Jessica Swanlake to her
   other, bureaucratic and sedate, boyfriend, Jeremy (also referred to as
   "Beaver" because of his beard).

   Part Two: "Un Perm' au Casino Hermann Goering": Slothrop is sent away
   by his superiors under mysterious circumstances to a casino on the
   recently liberated French Riviera, in which almost the entirety of Part
   Two takes place. He is in fact being monitored by associates of
   Pointsman, including Katje and a linguist named Sir Stephen
   Dodson-Truck. One of the more bizarre Pavlovian episodes involves the
   conditioning of octopus Grigori to attack Katje. Early in part two, the
   octopus attacks Katje on the beach in France, and Slothrop is
   "conveniently" at hand to rescue her. Katje and Slothrop eventually
   have sex. At the Casino, he learns of a rocket with the irregular
   serial number 00000 (Slothrop comments that the numbering system
   doesn't allow for four zeroes in one serial, let alone five), which
   features a mysterious component called the S-Geraet (short for
   Schwarzgeraet, 'black device'), made out of the hitherto unknown
   plastic Imipolex G. It is hinted that Slothrop's prescience of rocket
   hits is due to being conditioned as an infant by the creator of
   Imipolex G, Laszlo Jamf. Later, the reality of this story is called
   into question, as is the very existence of Slothrop's original sexual
   exploits.

   Meanwhile, at The White Visitation, Pointsman brings the unit and its
   mission under his control. The unit's nominal commander, Brigadier
   General Ernest Pudding, who is haunted by his traumatic memories of
   World War I, is brought to (literal) submission through
   sado-masochistic rituals with Katje, engineered by Pointsman.

   Slothrop becomes increasingly paranoid, as old associates disappear. He
   begins to suspect he is being monitored and adopts the persona (one of
   many) of "Ian Scuffling," a British war correspondent. He escapes from
   the casino into "The Zone", the coalescing post-war wasteland of
   Europe, first to Nice in France and then to Switzerland, searching for
   the 00000 and S-Geraet. In the closing of Part Two, Katje is revealed
   to be safe in England, enjoying a day at the beach with Roger Mexico
   and Jessica, as well as Pointsman, who is in charge of Slothrop's
   furtive supervision. While unable to contact Slothrop (or prohibited
   from contacting him), Katje continues to follow his actions through
   Pointsman, who is showing greater signs of mental instability.

   Part Three, "In The Zone": Slothrop's quest continues for some time as
   he meets or is chased by other characters, compared at various times to
   such characters as Orpheus and Wagner's Tannhauser. He learns more
   about his own past, Dr. Jamf's experiments on him, and his father's
   apparent complicity. In this section, Slothrop comes to doubt that his
   search for the S-Gerat is a Grail quest and finds his paranoia ("the
   fear that everything is connected") succumbing to "anti-paranoia" ("the
   fear that nothing is connected"). On the way he meets Geli Tripping, a
   self-described witch in love with a Russian colonel, Vaslav
   Tchitcherine, who had previously worked for the Soviet state bringing
   the New Turkic Alphabet to central Asia, especially Khirghizstan, where
   he had sought a mystical experience referred to as the "Khirghiz
   Light". Slothrop and Geli have a near-mystical experience at the summit
   of the Brocken, the German mountain that was the setting for
   Walpurgisnacht in Goethe's Faust. Slothrop's travels bring him to
   Nordhausen, in Germany, and the Mittlewerk, where V-2 rockets were
   assembled using slave labor from the Dora concentration camp.
   Confronted by the racist American Major Duane Marvy, he escapes in a
   slapstick chase.

   Slothrop meets members of the Schwarzkommando, a fictional cadre of
   African rocket technicians, descended from survivors of the Herero
   genocide of 1904 who were brought to Europe by German colonials. An
   extensive subplot details a schism within the Schwarzkommando; one
   faction is bent on a program of racial suicide, while the other finds
   mystical, semi-religious meaning in the V-2 rocket. Another long
   subplot details Tchitcherine's past and his quest to hunt and kill
   Enzian, leader of the latter group of Schwarzkommando and, it turns
   out, Tchitcherine's half-brother.

   With papers identifying him as former German film star Max Schlepzig in
   Berlin, Slothrop adopts an operatic Viking costume with the horns
   removed from the helmet, making it look like a rocket nose-cone and is
   given the name "Rocketman". One of the people he meets is the American
   sailor Pig Bodine (who or whose ancestors appear in most of Pynchon's
   other works). Bodine commissions Slothrop to retrieve a large stash of
   hashish from the centre of the Potsdam Conference. In the nearby
   abandoned movie studio that was once the center of the German film
   industry, Slothrop meets Margherita (Greta) Erdmann, a former silent
   film actress from the era of German Expressionist film, now in physical
   and mental decline. Slothrop also comes to meet Gerhardt von Goell, a
   megalomaniac German director. who had previously been seen in Britain,
   directing a fake propaganda film featuring Black soldiers in Germany.
   Von Goell is now involved in black market activities. In the longest
   episode of the book, we learn more of the past history of Franz
   Poekler, who fathered a child, Ilse, with his wife Leni after being
   aroused Greta's image in an erotic scene in Alpdruecken, von Goell's
   "masterpiece". Greta had also become pregnant in the filming of that
   scene, producing a daughter of her own, Bianca. While working on the
   V-2 project, Poekler had been coerced into working on the S-Geraet by
   Blicero, who was holding Ilse in a concentration camp, allowing her to
   visit Poekler only once a year. As Ilse ages over several years,
   however, Poekler becomes increasingly paranoid that she is really a
   series of impostors sent each year to mollify him. Poekler's work for
   Blicero is tied to the history of organic chemistry, with its own
   outcomes in the production of dyes and plastics and the international
   cartels that would come to control them, such as I.G. Farben, and a
   culture of death-in-life.

   Slothrop is led by Margherita to northern Germany and onto the Anubis,
   a private yacht (named for the Egyptian god of the dead) filled with
   uninhibited European aristocrats. Here, Slothrop has sex with
   Margherita's teenage daughter, Bianca. Margherita, along with her
   partner, Thanatz, are revealed to know more about the 00000, S-Geraet,
   and Imipolex G than they let on. Ensign Morituri, a Japanese liaison
   officer, tells Slothrop about how Margherita and Thanatz had brought
   their traveling sado-masochistic act to Captain Blicero's rocket
   battery, from which Rocket 00000 had apparently been fired in the
   Spring of 1945, towards the end of the war. Margherita spent many days
   in a mysterious and ambiguously described factory, where she was
   clothed in an outfit made from the "erotic" plastic Imipolex G.
   Slothrop falls overboard and is rescued by black marketeers heading
   towards Peenemuende, the test site for the V-2 rocket, now occupied by
   Soviet forces.

   Slothrop later returns to the Anubis to find Bianca dead, possibly
   hastening his already hinted-at decline. He continues his pilgrimage
   through northern Germany, having changed clothing with Tchitcherine,
   arriving at Lueneberg Heath and the town of Cuxhaven, also sites of
   tests and launches by Allied forces of captured V-2 rockets. On the
   way, he again meets Major Marvy, who fails to recognize him. At a
   village festival, he is invited by children to don the costume of a
   pre-Christian Pig Hero, "Plechazunga." Meeting Poekler at the abandoned
   amusement park where Ilse used to meet her father, Slothrop finds out
   more about his childhood and the 00000. It becomes steadily apparent
   that Slothrop is connected to Laszlo Jamf through Lyle Bland, a
   Slothrop family friend who apparently played a role in funding Jamf's
   experiments on the infant Slothrop. Bland, in turn, is connected to
   many threads, including pinball machines and the Masons, that implicate
   him as part of an international conspiracy of industrial cartels.

   Slothrop is introduced to and sleeps with Solange, a prostitute who is
   actually Leni Poekler, recently freed from a concentration camp
   herself. In same building, Major Marvy has found Slothrop's pig costume
   and dons it, only to be caught, sedated, and castrated by agents
   working for Pointsman, who believe that Slothrop is still in the suit.
   Major political and social realignments have been taking place
   throughout The Zone. Towards the end of this section, several
   characters not seen since early in the novel make a return, including
   Pointsman, who is now in official disgrace, as bureaucratic operatives
   consider how to deal with him. Other characters, including Pirate
   Prentice and Katje Borgesius, begin to coalesce as a group styling
   itself as the "Counterforce" in resistance to the emerging post-war
   industrial-military complex.

   Part Four: The Counterforce: Elements in this section become
   increasingly fantastic and sometimes self-referential, the narrator at
   one point saying, "You will want cause and effect. All right" (page 663
   in the Viking edition) before explaining how certain events in Part 3
   tie in. Despite the efforts of some to save him, Slothrop is repeatedly
   sidetracked until his persona fragments totally, more than one hundred
   pages before the novel's end. A flashback reveals how Roger Mexico, now
   in Germany, has come to join the Counterforce despite its inherent
   contradictions as a group organizing against international
   organizations. A long digression gives the story of "Byron the Bulb," a
   sentient, seemingly immortal lightbulb whose existence links with Dr.
   Jamf and his experiments and to the integration of power companies and
   their Grid to the network of cartels. The Schwarzkommando become
   reunited and finish construction of their own version of the 00000
   rocket.

   There are several brief, hallucinatory stories of comic, fallible
   superheroes; silly Kamikaze pilots; and an "Incident in the
   Transvesites' Toilet" where Slothrop has been hiding in drag. Such
   incidents may be products of Slothrop's finally collapsed mind; or of
   the increasingly chaotic state of affairs outside the realm of a rising
   technological class and society that comes to be labeled the
   "Raketen-Stadt" (Rocket-State) of the future. For Slothrop, these
   scenes more or less culminate with his finding, and failing to
   understand, a headline announcing the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

   Tchitcherine is told by his superior officer that he is to head back to
   the U.S.S.R. with some German rocket scientists, despite his own
   misgivings about Marxist dialectics. A conference is held by members of
   the Counterforce, which now includes some with questionable pasts,
   personalities, or motives, such as von Goell. Jessica tells Roger that
   she is going to marry Jeremy/Beaver. Invited to a dinner at the home of
   a German industrialist, Roger and Pig Bodine manage to escape with the
   help of some disgusting culinary repartee, but it becomes increasingly
   clear that the Counterforce does not have the capacity to counter the
   emerging Rocket State, in part because "the Man has a branch office in
   each of our brains."

   Some individuals, however, provide some hope. Earlier, Slothrop had
   encountered a young boy on what seems to be a futile quest to find his
   lost pet lemming. Meeting once again, it turns out that the lemming has
   been found. Geli Tripping's complete love for Tchitcherine and her
   connection with the natural organic world contrasts with a flashback in
   which Blicero explains to Gottfried his obsessive desire to transcend
   nature and "its cycle of infection and death." Geli does cast a spell
   on Tchitcherine that (perhaps) keeps him from recognizing Enzian when
   they finally meet, averting a potentially fatal encounter.

   The final identification of Slothrop of any certainty is his picture on
   the cover of an album by obscure English band "The Fool" (another
   allusion to Tarot, which becomes increasingly significant), where he is
   credited as playing the harmonica and kazoo. The hundred pages or so of
   the novel include titled vignettes that summarize events in Slothrop's
   home town of Mingeborough; offer a (self-referential) reading of the
   Tarot cards for Weismann/Blicero, who also prepares for a final launch
   of the 00000 rocket with Gottfried in the nosecone; describe failed
   last-minute non-rescues by popular culture heroes; and allude to the
   Sacrifice of Isaac and the mythical figures of Apollo and Orpheus.

   As the novel draws to an ambiguous close, the launch of the rocket with
   Gottfied is intercut with scenes contemporary to the novel's
   publication, at the (fictional) Orpheus (movie) Theater in Los Angeles,
   managed by a character named "Richard M. Zhlubb," a thinly-veiled
   parody of President Richard Nixon. Zhlubb is running a "Bengt Ekarot /
   Maria Casares Film Festival." Both actors played personifications of
   Death, in Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and Jean Cocteau's Orpheus,
   respectively, overt examples of several possible references in the
   novel to European modernist cinema. The novel concludes as a rocket
   (perhaps Weissman's) is frozen in its last moment of descent above the
   theater, where the film being projected has broken, and a hymn composed
   by Slothrop's heretical colonial ancestor, William Slothrop, is
   offered.
   This image of Wernher von Braun is referred to in the narrative, giving
   a quite exact timeframe for some events in the book.
