   Carrie Pilby's eponymous main character is a 19-year-old genius who
   graduated early from Harvard College and has no idea how to fit in,
   date, or talk to other people after college. She believes the majority
   of people in her hometown, New York City, to be sex-obsessed, immoral,
   and hypocrites. She felt the same way about students who did
   dangerous things in college, like drinking to excess and having sex,
   and as a result felt very isolated, although she confesses that she
   reluctantly lost her virginity to a professor there. Her therapist in
   New York gives her a five-point plan to test her very black-and-white
   beliefs, including forcing herself to go on blind dates and attend
   parties. She meets a cast of characters who challenge her beliefs, and
   she even becomes attracted to a man whose views she detests.
   Ultimately, the main character faces this universal coming-of-age
   question: Which tradeoffs, if any, are acceptable in order to fit in?
