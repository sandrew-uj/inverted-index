   Janie Crawford, an African-American woman in her forties, recounts her
   life starting with her sexual awakening, which she compares to a
   blossoming pear tree kissed by bees in spring. Around this time, Janie
   allows a local boy, Johnny Taylor, to kiss her, which Janie's
   grandmother, Nanny, witnesses.

   As a young enslaved woman, Nanny was raped by her white enslaver, then
   gave birth to a mixed-race daughter she named Leafy. Though Nanny
   wanted a better life for her daughter and even escaped her jealous
   mistress after the American Civil War, Leafy was later raped by her
   school teacher and became pregnant with Janie. Shortly after Janie's
   birth, Leafy began to drink and stay out at night, eventually running
   away and leaving Janie with Nanny.

   Nanny, having transferred her hopes for stability and opportunity from
   Leafy to Janie, arranges for Janie to marry Logan Killicks, an older
   farmer looking for a wife. However, Killicks doesn't love Janie and
   wants only a domestic helper rather than a lover or partner; he thinks
   she doesn't do enough around the farm and considers her ungrateful.
   When Janie speaks to Nanny about her desire for love, Nanny, too,
   accuses Janie of being spoiled and, soon afterwards, dies.

   Unhappy, disillusioned, and lonely, Janie leaves Killicks and runs off
   with Jody (Joe) Starks, a glib man who takes her to the all-black
   community of Eatonville, Florida. Starks arranges to buy more land,
   establishes a general store, and is soon elected mayor of the town.
   However, Janie soon realizes that Starks wants her as a trophy wife to
   reinforce his powerful position in town and to run the store, even
   forbidding her from taking part in the town's social life. During their
   twenty-year marriage, he treats her as his property, criticizing her,
   controlling her, and physically abusing her. Finally, when Starks's
   kidney begins to fail, Janie says that he never knew her because he
   would not let her be free.

   After Starks dies, Janie becomes financially independent through his
   estate. Though she is beset with suitors, including men of means, she
   turns them all down until she meets a young drifter and gambler named
   Vergible Woods, known as "Tea Cake". He plays the guitar for her and
   initially treats her with kindness and respect. Janie is hesitant
   because she is older and wealthy, but she eventually falls in love with
   him and decides to run away with him to Jacksonville to marry. They
   move to Belle Glade, in the northern part of the Everglades region
   ("the muck"), where they find work planting and harvesting beans. While
   their relationship is volatile and sometimes violent, Janie finally has
   the marriage with love that she wanted. Her image of the pear tree
   blossom is revived. Suddenly, the area is hit by the great 1928
   Okeechobee hurricane. Tea Cake is bitten by a rabid dog while saving
   Janie from drowning and becomes increasingly jealous and unpredictable.
   When he tries to shoot Janie with his pistol, she fatally shoots him
   with a rifle in self-defense and is charged with murder.

   At the trial, Tea Cake's black male friends show up to oppose her, but
   a group of local white women arrive to support Janie. After the
   all-white jury acquits Janie, she gives Tea Cake a lavish funeral. Tea
   Cake's friends forgive her, asking her to remain in the Everglades.
   However, she decides to return to Eatonville. As she expected, the
   residents gossip about her when she returns to town. The story ends
   where it started, as Janie finishes recounting her life to Pheoby.
