   Commander John Lane returns from a ten-year mission in space to find
   that the teenagers of Spaceport City have organized themselves into
   "outfits", well disciplined, non-violent little gangs with their own
   customs and argot, and that the parent's role in teen upbringing has
   become minimal. His 16-year-old daughter Susan belongs to the Red Cat
   Outfit, whose newest member Bud is actually a spy for the alien fleet
   that has secretly followed John Lane as he returned to Earth.
