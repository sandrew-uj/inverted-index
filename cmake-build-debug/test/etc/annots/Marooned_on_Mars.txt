   In the foreword, "Tomorrow's World", the author comments on how the
   development of liquid-fueled rockets points to missions to the Moon and
   establishment of a lunar base in the near future. Then he points to
   Mars as the next obvious step in the exploration of the solar system.
   He mentions the possibility of life on Mars, recapping what astronomers
   knew about Mars in 1952, and speculates on what explorers, like those
   in his story, will find.

   After spending two weeks on Earth for testing, Chuck Svenson returns
   home to the Moon to prepare for his part in the first expedition to
   Mars, as the ship's radar operator and communications technician. Jeff
   Foldingchair pilots the small, fast rocket ship that was sent to pick
   Chuck up from the spaceport high in the Andes. While they wait to take
   off Jeff receives a message telling him that the Mars expedition's
   take-off date has been moved up to enable the ship to avoid a flock of
   meteors that lunar radar has detected.

   Although Jeff seems perturbed by the message, the full meaning of it
   does not register with Chuck until they land on the Moon: the
   Mars-bound rocket is now scheduled to blast off the day before Chuck's
   eighteenth birthday, which means that he cannot go. In spite of
   everything Governor Braithwaite can do, Chuck has been replaced on
   rocket ship Eros by a slightly older man, Lewis Wong.

   Acting on hints from Jeff, Chuck stows away on Eros, hiding in the
   section holding the ship's hydroponic gardens. With its six-man crew
   and one stowaway on board, the ship blasts off from the Moon and the
   pilot Nat Rothman quickly puts it onto a Hohmann transfer orbit that
   will take the expedition to Mars. All too quickly Chuck is discovered
   by the ship's engineer, Richard Steele, and taken to the ship's captain
   and the expedition's leader, Miles Vance. Officially Chuck is under
   arrest and Vance chides him for taking one-seventh of each of the other
   men's supplies. Unofficially, though, every member of the crew is
   delighted with the stunt and even the people on the Moon and Earth find
   cause to cheer. The celebratory atmosphere does not last long.

   As Eros passes in front of the flock of meteors that lunar radar had
   spotted, it runs into what the lunar radar could not see - a cloud of
   much smaller particles surrounding the larger pieces of space debris.
   Two of the particles, pebbles smaller than peas, hit the ship and
   penetrate it. The second one goes through the ship's electronic
   controls and damages them. Now Chuck and Lewis will spend the rest of
   the trip to Mars repairing them.

   The repair job is complicated by the discovery of an unknown component
   in the wreckage of the control system. It had been inserted by an
   engineer who died in an auto accident before he could provide proper
   documentation for the device. Chuck and Lewis have to figure out how it
   works, repair it, and then calibrate it before they can land on Mars.

   After making two attempts, in which he nearly loses control of the
   ship, Rothman brings the ship down on the Martian surface on the third
   attempt only to have one of the landing legs give way and leave the
   ship to fall over onto its side. By luck everyone survives the crash
   and Dr. Paul Sokolsky has little to do but tend to minor cuts and
   abrasions. After checking the damage and making some urgent repairs
   they discover that they have ninety days in which to make major repairs
   that Steele estimates will take five to six months.

   Before they get down to the task of getting the ship ready to return to
   Earth, the men take a break. Dr. Sokolsky discovers plants, which
   explains why the thin atmosphere contains oxygen: they can replace the
   tanks on their spacesuits with battery-operated compressors and spend
   more time outside the ship. They also discover ruins and artwork
   depicting humanoid Martians, apparently long gone. It takes them a week
   to get the ship lifted just enough that they can begin repairing the
   broken structure well enough to lift the ship fully upright and prepare
   for take-off.

   As a means of boosting morale, Chuck and Dr. Sokolsky are sent on a
   two-day hike to check out one of the canals, finding that it is
   actually a vine-like plant growing in a broad band across the planet's
   surface. On the way they catch glimpses of wide-eyed animals at night
   and wake up to find that some of their possessions are missing. When
   they return to the ship they discover that a number of tools have gone
   missing. As tools keep disappearing the men get desperate and
   eventually decide to go to the ruins to search for them. When they
   return they find the ship has been tilted over again and that the
   winches have been destroyed. They conclude that the Martians are not
   hostile, but simply want the men to stay.

   After setting a trap Chuck follows a Martian into the ruins and then
   down into a maze of tunnels under the old city. There he is captured by
   the rodent-like humanoid creatures. The elder of the group introduces
   himself as Sptz-Rrll and shows Chuck the broken copper impeller of a
   rotary air compressor. The Martians have been trying to repair it with
   one of the welders they have taken from the spaceship. After the
   Martians leave in response to a call Chuck frees himself and takes the
   welder. Before he leaves he repairs the impeller. As he tries to find
   his way out he is recaptured by the Martians.

   Seeing the repaired impeller, Sptz-Rrll frees Chuck and, accompanied by
   over fifty other Martians, takes Chuck back to the ship along with all
   the stolen tools. In the ship, using a notepad and pencil to draw
   diagrams, Sptz-Rrll offers the help of his people in preparing the ship
   to return to Earth and Steele offers to leave much of the ship's
   unnecessary equipment behind for the Martians. Later trade between
   Earth and Mars will bring new drugs from Martian plants to Earth and
   material from Earth will enable the Martians to revive their dying
   civilization and expand it.
