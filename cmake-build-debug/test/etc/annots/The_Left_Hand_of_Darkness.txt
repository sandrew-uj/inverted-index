   The protagonist of the novel is Genly Ai, a male Terran native, who is
   sent to invite the planet Gethen to join the Ekumen, a coalition of
   humanoid worlds.^[24] Ai travels to the Gethen planetary system on a
   starship which remains in solar orbit with Ai's companions, who are in
   stasis; Ai himself is sent to Gethen alone, as the "first mobile" or
   Envoy. Like all envoys of the Ekumen, he can "mindspeak"--a form of
   quasi-telepathic speech, which Gethenians are capable of, but of which
   they are unaware.^[25] He lands in the Gethenian kingdom of Karhide,
   and spends two years attempting to persuade the members of its
   government of the value of joining the Ekumen. Karhide is one of two
   major nations on Gethen, the other being Orgoreyn.^[b]

   The novel begins the day before an audience that Ai has obtained with
   Argaven Harge, the king of Karhide. Ai manages this through the help of
   Estraven, the prime minister, who seems to believe in Ai's mission, but
   the night before the audience, Estraven tells Ai that he can no longer
   support Ai's cause with the king. Ai begins to doubt Estraven's loyalty
   because of his strange mannerisms, which Ai finds effeminate and
   ambiguous. The behavior of people in Karhide is dictated by
   shifgrethor, an intricate set of unspoken social rules and formal
   courtesy. Ai does not understand this system, thus making it difficult
   for him to understand Estraven's motives, and contributing to his
   distrust of Estraven.^[26] The next day, as he prepares to meet the
   King, Ai learns that Estraven has been accused of treason, and exiled
   from the country. The pretext for Estraven's exile was his handling of
   a border dispute with the neighboring country of Orgoreyn, in which
   Estraven was seen as being too conciliatory. Ai meets with the king,
   who rejects his invitation to join the Ekumen.^[27] Discouraged, Ai
   decides to travel through Karhide, as the spring has just begun,
   rendering the interior of the frozen country accessible.

   Ai travels to a Fastness, a dwelling of people of the Handdarrata, one
   of two major Gethenian religions. He pays the fastness for a
   foretelling, an art practiced to prove the "perfect uselessness of
   knowing the answer to the wrong question".^[28]^[29] He asks if Gethen
   will be a member of the Ekumen in five years, expecting that the
   Foretellers will give him an ambiguous response, but he is answered
   "yes". This leads him to muse that the Gethenians have "trained hunch
   to run in harness".^[30] After several months of travelling through
   Karhide, Ai decides to pursue his mission in Orgoreyn, to which he has
   received an invitation.

   Ai reaches the Orgota capital of Mishnory, where he finds that the
   Orgota politicians are initially far more direct with him. He is given
   comfortable quarters, and is allowed to present his invitation to the
   council that rules Orgoreyn. Three members of the council, Shusgis,
   Obsle, and Yegey, are particularly supportive of him. These three are
   members of an "Open Trade" faction, which wants to end the conflict
   with Karhide. Estraven, who was banished from Karhide, is found working
   with these council members, and tells Ai that he was responsible for
   Ai's reception in Orgoreyn.^[31] Despite the support, Ai feels uneasy.
   Estraven warns him not to trust the Orgota leaders, and he hears rumors
   of the "Sarf", or secret police, that truly control Orgoreyn. He
   ignores both his feeling and the warning, and is once again blindsided;
   he is arrested unexpectedly one night, interrogated, and sent to a
   far-northern labor camp where he suffers harsh cold, is forced into
   hard labor, and is given debilitating drugs. He becomes ill and his
   death seems imminent.

   His captors expect him to die in the camp, but to Ai's great surprise,
   Estraven--whom Ai still distrusts--goes to great lengths to save him.
   Estraven poses as a prison guard and breaks Ai out of the farm, using
   his training with the Handdarrata to induce dothe, or hysterical
   strength, to aid him in the process. Estraven spends the last of his
   money on supplies, and then steals more, breaking his own moral code.
   The pair begin a dangerous 80-day trek across the northern Gobrin ice
   sheet back to Karhide, because Estraven believes that the reappearance
   of Ai in Karhide will convince Karhide to accept the Ekumen treaty,
   knowing that Karhide will want the honour of doing so before Orgoreyn.
   Over the journey Ai and Estraven learn to trust and accept one
   another's differences. Ai is eventually successful in teaching Estraven
   mindspeech; Estraven hears Ai speaking in his mind with the voice of
   Estraven's dead sibling and lover Arek,^[32] demonstrating the close
   connection that Ai and Estraven have developed. When they reach
   Karhide, Ai sends a radio transmission to his ship, which lands a few
   days later. Estraven tries to cross the land border with Orgoreyn,
   because he is still exiled from Karhide, but is killed by border
   guards, who capture Ai. Estraven's prediction is borne out when Ai's
   presence in Karhide triggers the collapse of governments in both
   Karhide and Orgoreyn--Orgoreyn's because its claim that Ai had died of
   a disease was shown to be false. Karhide agrees to join the Ekumen,
   followed shortly by Orgoreyn, completing Ai's mission.^[33]
