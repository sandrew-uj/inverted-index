   The book takes the perspective of soldiers with the Group of Soviet
   Forces in East Germany as they prepare to launch an invasion of West
   Germany. Soviet General Mikhail Malinsky, commander of the First
   Western Front, discusses the upcoming invasion with other Soviet
   leaders.

   The plans call for a simultaneous thrust on three fronts: across the
   North German Plain, through the Fulda Gap, and across Bavaria. NATO
   commanders are to be bluffed into thinking the main assault will come
   at the Fulda Gap, but the main effort will be on the North German
   Plain, led by Malinsky. Airborne forces will be dropped deep into West
   Germany to disrupt the NATO rearguard.

   The Soviet commanders believe that if Soviet forces are deep inside
   West Germany in three days, NATO will not be able to use its nuclear
   weapons to blunt the advance. A Soviet propaganda film about the
   destruction of Lueneberg (carefully produced at a Moscow studio) will
   be used to psychologically shock the West Germans.

   When the invasion begins, the Soviets advance quickly, bypassing strong
   points whenever possible. The successful capture of a NATO command post
   and a Soviet tank company's capture and shepherding of a German refugee
   convoy outside Hildesheim adds to the speed of movement. The West
   German forces positioned on the inter-German border are gradually cut
   off from their resupply lines, while a unit trapped in the Cuxhaven
   peninsula fights to the last man. Deprived of reconnaissance assets,
   however, Malinsky worries that the U.S. Army forces based near the
   Fulda Gap will come to the aid of the British, Dutch, and West German
   forces that he faces.

   Day three of the war finds the Soviets nearing the industrial Ruhr
   valley. Hoping to forestall a complete West German collapse, remaining
   NATO forces in the north, joined by the strong and relatively
   unbloodied U.S. Army from the south, hit Malinsky's First Western Front
   from all sides. It is not enough; before the NATO counterattack has a
   chance to succeed, the West German government asks the USSR for a
   cease-fire. In the aftermath, the Soviet Army occupies all of Germany
   east of the Rhine.
