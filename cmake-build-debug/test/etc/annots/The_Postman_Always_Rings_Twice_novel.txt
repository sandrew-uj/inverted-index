   The story is narrated in the first person by Frank Chambers, a young
   drifter who stops at a rural California diner for a meal and ends up
   working there. The diner is operated by a beautiful young woman, Cora,
   and her much older husband, Nick Papadakis, sometimes called "the
   Greek".

   Frank and Cora feel an immediate attraction to each other and begin a
   passionate affair with sadomasochistic qualities. Cora is tired of her
   situation, married to a man she does not love and working at a diner
   that she wants to own and improve. Frank and Cora scheme to murder the
   Greek in order to start a new life together without Cora losing the
   diner.

   They plan on striking Nick's head and making it seem he fell and
   drowned in the bathtub. Cora fells Nick with a solid blow, but a sudden
   power outage and the appearance of a policeman make the scheme fail.
   Nick recovers and because of retrograde amnesia does not suspect that
   he narrowly avoided being killed.

   Determined to kill Nick, Frank and Cora fake a car accident. They ply
   Nick with wine, strike him on the head, and crash the car. Frank is
   also gravely injured in the crash, while Cora simulates minor injuries
   and bruises. The local prosecutor suspects what has actually occurred
   but does not have enough evidence to prove it. As a tactic intended to
   get Cora and Frank to turn on each other, he charges only Cora with the
   crime of Nick's murder, coercing Frank to sign a complaint against her.

   Cora, furious and indignant, insists on offering a full confession
   detailing both their roles. Her lawyer tricks her into dictating that
   confession to a member of his own staff. Cora, believing her confession
   made, returns to prison. Though Cora would be sure to learn of the
   trickery, a few valuable hours are gained. The lawyer uses the time to
   manipulate the insurance companies financially interested in the trial
   to have their private detective recant his testimony, which was the
   final remaining weapon in the prosecution's arsenal. The state is
   forced to grant Cora a plea agreement under which she is given a
   suspended sentence and no jail time.

   After the trial, Cora's diner begins to boom, but her and Frank's
   relationship worsens. While Cora is attending her mother's funeral,
   Frank has an affair with a wild cat tamer. Upon returning home, Cora
   tells him that she is pregnant. However, she is also angered when she
   finds out about his affair.

   Frank and Cora eventually patch things up, get married and plan a happy
   future and a family. Then Cora is killed in a car crash while Frank is
   driving. The book ends with Frank, from death row, summarizing the
   events that followed, explaining that he was wrongly convicted of
   murdering Cora. The text, he hopes, will be published after his
   execution.
