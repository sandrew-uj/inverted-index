   As originally published, De Quincey's account was organised into
   two parts:
     * Part I begins with a notice "To the Reader", to establish the
       narrative frame: "I here present you, courteous reader, with the
       record of a remarkable period in my life...." It is followed by the
       substance of Part I,
          + Preliminary Confessions, devoted to the author's childhood and
            youth, and concentrated upon the emotional and psychological
            factors that underlay the later opium experiences--especially
            the period in his late teens that De Quincey spent as a
            homeless runaway in Oxford Street in London in 1802 and 1803.
     * Part II is split into several sections:
          + A relatively brief introduction and connecting passage,
            followed by
          + The Pleasures of Opium, which discusses the early and largely
            positive phase of the author's experience with the drug, from
            1804 until 1812;
          + Introduction to the Pains of Opium, which delivers a second
            instalment of autobiography, taking De Quincey from youth to
            maturity; and
          + The Pains of Opium, which recounts the extreme of the author's
            opium experience (up to that time), with insomnia, nightmares,
            frightening visions, and difficult physical symptoms.
     * Another "Notice to the Reader" attempts to clarify the chronology
       of the whole.

   The cover of Thomas De Quincey's book Confessions of an Opium-Eater.
   This version was published by the Mershon Company in 1898.

   Though De Quincey was later criticised for giving too much attention to
   the pleasure of opium and not enough to the harsh negatives of
   addiction, The Pains of Opium is in fact significantly longer than The
   Pleasures. However, even when trying to convey darker truths, De
   Quincey's language can seem seduced by the compelling nature of the
   opium experience:

     The sense of space, and in the end, the sense of time, were both
     powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, &c. were exhibited in
     proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to conceive.
     Space swelled, and was amplified to an extent of unutterable
     infinity. This, however, did not disturb me so much as the vast
     expansion of time; I sometimes seemed to have lived for 70 or 100
     years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a
     millennium passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far
     beyond the limits of any human experience.
