   Carrie, an old friend of the hero, Travis McGee, arrives at his
   houseboat, the Busted Flush. She has a suitcase full of suspicious
   money. Carrie asks Travis to keep it safe for her for two weeks and to
   send it to her sister if she does not return in two weeks. For his
   troubles, McGee can keep $10,000 worth.

   A fortnight passes and Carrie doesn't return. McGee investigates and
   learns she died in a traffic accident but he believes she has been
   murdered. His investigation leads him to an apartment complex full of
   singles presided over by a landlord called 'Big Daddy'. He also meets
   the newly widowed Cindy Birdsong, who becomes his new romantic
   interest.
