   The novel begins in Florida in the near future. China and the United
   States are sending competing first missions to Mars, although it is
   clear the Chinese will arrive first. The book's protagonist is Manny
   Garcia, a teenager who is fascinated by space flight. He, along with
   his girlfriend Kelly, his best friend Dak, and Dak's girlfriend Alicia,
   are partying on the beach one night and almost run over a man who has
   passed out from drinking. The man is Travis Broussard, a former
   astronaut who was forced to retire in disgrace. Travis lives with his
   cousin Jubal, who is mentally deficient in some ways, but is also a
   scientific genius.

   Jubal has invented a device called the "squeezer", a spherical
   impenetrable silver force field that can be formed or have its size
   changed with no cost of energy. Thus, the squeezer can compress
   whatever matter is within it to an arbitrarily small volume and then
   vent the resulting plasma/energy in a controlled way. Travis and the
   teenagers realize the device has numerous practical uses, but it is
   also a dangerous weapon. They decide to use the squeezers to power a
   spaceship and plan to arrive at Mars ahead of the slower traveling
   American and Chinese missions already in transit, and to be available
   should Jubal's prediction of problems with the American drive prove
   true.

   They succeed in building the Red Thunder out of used railroad tank cars
   on schedule, and near their shoestring budget of $1 million and take
   off. The four teenagers form the crew with Travis as pilot. They arrive
   at Mars a day ahead of the Chinese mission. They learn from the Chinese
   that the American mission was stranded by an accident (their VASIMR
   drive exploded). Red Thunder is able to locate and rescue the surviving
   crew members during their return to Earth.

   When they arrive back on Earth, they are heroes. They use the publicity
   of their trip to ensure that no nation or individual controls the
   squeezer technology, and help form a separate non-political
   organization to control and disseminate the new technology. With this
   new technology, people are able to eliminate waste dumps and pollution,
   and begin a new era of space travel throughout the solar system and
   beyond.
