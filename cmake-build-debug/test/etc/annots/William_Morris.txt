   Old English verse Morris's translation
   D-a com of more     under misthleothum     Came then from the
   moor-land, all under the mist-bents,
   Grendel gongan.     godes yrre baer.     Grendel a-going there, bearing
   God's anger.
   mynte se manscad-a     manna cynnes     The scather the ill one was
   minded of mankind
   sumne besyrwan     in sele tham hean.     To have one in his toils from
   the high hall aloft.
