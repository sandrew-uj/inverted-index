   In a near-future where the Neural-Autofocus and other neural implants
   made formerly mentally challenged individuals into equals or superiors
   to those with normal brain functionality, Owen is a high school teacher
   whose surgeon father helped develop the implants to control his
   epilepsy. When the United States Supreme Court rules that implanted
   individuals are no longer a protected class, Owen's life is changed
   forever, as he discovers that his implant has a very dangerous secret.
