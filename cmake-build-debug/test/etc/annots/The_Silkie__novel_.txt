   Taking its inspiration from the Celtic legend of the Selkie, the novel
   describes a race of apparent humans with the ability to change into
   other forms. One, like the Selkie of legend, can live underwater.
   Another can survive and travel unprotected in outer space. In all three
   forms the Silkies can wield mental powers over energy to some degree.

   After a prologue which purports to explain the origin of the Silkies as
   an experiment in genetic manipulation, the action moves forward over a
   hundred years to a future in which the Silkies are numerous and live on
   Earth. Humanity has assimilated them by means of the Special People,
   who can establish telepathic rapport with the Silkies. All Silkies are
   male, and most are married to women of the Special People. They are
   employed as police in space, and most are comfortable with that role.
   One dedicated Silkie, Nat Cemp, encounters three different alien races,
   and with each encounter he gains more powers and learns more about the
   true nature of the Silkies, and of the Universe.

   As with other Van Vogt works, the novel introduces a psychological
   element similar to general semantics. Here the Silkies use the
   so-called "Logic of Levels". Instead of the symbol/reality dichotomy of
   General Semantics, the Logic of Levels substitutes the concept of
   behaviors and instincts as complex neurological structures and feedback
   loops, simpler levels being built on more complex ones. By manipulating
   these complexes with their powers the Silkies can defeat adversaries,
   who find themselves caught in self-amplifying feedback from their own
   instincts and desires.
