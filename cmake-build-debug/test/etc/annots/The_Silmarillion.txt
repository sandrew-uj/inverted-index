   The events described in The Silmarillion, as in Tolkien's other
   Middle-earth writings, were meant to have taken place at some time in
   Earth's past.^[T 2] In keeping with this idea, The Silmarillion is
   meant to have been translated from Bilbo's three-volume Translations
   from the Elvish, which he wrote while at Rivendell.^[T 3] The book
   covers the whole history of the world, Arda, in its five sections as
   follows:
