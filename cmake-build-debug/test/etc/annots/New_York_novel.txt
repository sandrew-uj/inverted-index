   The novel chronicles the birth and growth of New York City, from the
   arrival of the first Dutch and other European colonists in the 17th
   century to the summer of 2009. Rutherford builds his novel on the
   histories of fictional families who live there. In New York, these
   families represent the successive waves of immigrants who have made the
   city multicultural.

   The early Dutch founders of New Amsterdam are typified by the Van Dyck
   family, who prosper in trade with the Native Americans; both the local
   Algonquian tribes, especially the Lenape, and the Iroquoian Mohawk who
   lived farther up the Hudson Valley and primarily along the Mohawk
   Valley. The Van Dycks soon unite with the English Thomas Master family
   (he also has a natural Native American daughter, whom he brings with
   him from Puritan New England). Van Dyck-Master descendants continue to
   live in New York through the entire saga, providing one of the unifying
   narrative strands. The character Quash is an enslaved African, who was
   brought forcefully to New Amsterdam and is held by Thomas Master; his
   descendants become part of the New York cultural mix.

   As the novel progresses, more families are introduced: the Irish
   O'Donnels, German Kellers, Italian Carusos, German-Jewish Adlers, and
   Puerto Rican Campos. Through their intertwining stories, Rutherfurd
   explores the various cultural traditions of the national groups and
   intercultural relations, which play out against the development of the
   city.

   Rutherfurd breaks the narrative into sections by date, twenty-seven in
   all. Most dates comprise one chapter; a few dates continue through two
   or three chapters. A set of three well-drawn maps of Manhattan Island
   helps the reader follow the action as the city develops. A fourth map
   of the New York City region provides a larger geographical context.
