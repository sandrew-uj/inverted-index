   After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet Union planted a number of
   long-term, deep-cover sleeper agents all over the United States, spies
   so thoroughly brainwashed that even they did not know they were agents
   and can be activated only by a special code phrase. (The phrase is a
   line from the Robert Frost poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening",
   followed by the agent's real first name.) Their mission was to sabotage
   crucial parts of the civil and military infrastructure in the event of
   conflict.

   More than 20 years pass, and the Cold War gradually gives way to
   detente. Narrowly escaping a relentless purge of old Stalinism
   loyalists, Nikolai Dalchimsky (Donald Pleasence), a rogue KGB
   headquarters clerk, travels to America, taking with him the Telefon
   Book which contains the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all
   the sleeper agents. He starts activating them, one by one. American
   counterintelligence is thrown into confusion when seemingly ordinary
   citizens blow up what were formerly top secret facilities that have
   since become relatively inconsequential, and then either commit suicide
   or die in the act itself.

   The KGB dares not tell its political leaders, much less the Americans,
   about its negligence in not deactivating the spy network. KGB Major
   Grigori Borzov (Charles Bronson), who is selected for his photographic
   memory, memorizes the contents of the only other copy of the Telefon
   Book. He is then sent to find and stop Dalchimsky quietly, before
   either side learns what is happening, which would greatly embarrass the
   KGB and possibly even start a war between the powers. Borzov is given
   the assistance of only a single agent, Barbara (Lee Remick), planted in
   America years before.

   Eventually, Borzov realizes the method behind Dalchimsky's pattern of
   attacks: he has chosen the agents by the first letters of their
   American hometowns, "writing" his own name in sabotage across America.
   Using that information, Borzov is able to anticipate Dalchimsky's next
   chosen sleeper agent, and locate and kill Dalchimsky.

   However, there are a number of twists. Barbara has orders from the KGB
   to assassinate Borzov once he succeeds, to get rid of a dangerous loose
   end. In addition, she is a double agent actually working for America.
   When she informs her American superior, Sandburg (Frank Marth), he also
   tells her to kill Borzov, so she will retain the confidence of the KGB.
   However, Barbara has fallen in love with her would-be target. She
   informs Borzov, and together they blackmail both sides into leaving
   them alone, holding the threat of the remaining Telefon agents over
   their heads.
