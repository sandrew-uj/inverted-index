   This second novel in the series recounts the story of how the
   Patternist society originated. The novel is set in Forsyth, California,
   a city near Los Angeles, in the 1970s. The leader of the telepathic
   humans that later became known as the Patternists, was a man originally
   from Africa named Doro. Doro is about 4,000 years old and immortal.
   Since Doro does not have physical immortality, he must move his essence
   to different bodies as time goes on for his continued survival. Doro
   tends to procreate with and breed people who are telepathically
   sensitive, in an effort to make a group of superhuman telepaths. The
   story is focused on one of Doro's daughters, named Mary, who is a
   young, poor biracial woman. Doro's hope is that his daughter Mary will
   connect with other telepaths and ultimately become an exceptional
   telepath who is able to link with other telepathic people.

   In the midst of Mary's status change from a "latent" to an "active"
   telepath, she makes the first ever Pattern as a result of her attaching
   mentally onto six other active telepathic people. Two years later,
   after Mary has added 1,500 people to her community of Patternists, Doro
   thinks Mary has acquired too much power and demands that she stop
   acquiring telepaths. This creates a conflict, as Mary will destroy
   herself and as a result all Patternists if she discontinues the
   expansion of her Patternist community. With support from her people,
   Mary gains the strength to fight and ultimately kill Doro. There are
   many Patternist casualties in the fight; however, Mary is ultimately
   able to continue to grow and protect the Patternist society she has
   created.
