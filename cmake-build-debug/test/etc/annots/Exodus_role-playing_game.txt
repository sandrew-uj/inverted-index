   In 2006 when Glutton Creeper Games obtained an license from Interplay
   to create a Fallout pen and paper role-playing game based on the d20
   Modern system started. Legal complications arose in mid-2007, when
   Bethesda Softworks' lawyers claimed Interplay was unable to license a
   role-playing game, and annulled the license deal. Glutton Creeper Games
   reworked the project into Exodus, removed all references to the Fallout
   franchise, and released the game in 2008. In spite of this, Exodus
   retained several concepts similar to the Fallout franchise with regards
   to its post-apocalyptic setting.

   In 2009, Glutton Creeper Games and Interplay came to a settlement over
   the license dispute. Glutton Creeper Games became a subsidiary of 4
   Hour Games by 2014, and the sourcebooks for Exodus were offered for
   sale on 4 Hour Games' website for a time.
