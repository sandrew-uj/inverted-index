   In Vampire Academy, guardian in training Rosemarie "Rose" Hathaway and
   Moroi princess Vasilisa "Lissa" Dragomir are brought back to their
   school, St. Vladimir's Academy, after running away two years prior.
   Upon their return, Guardian Dimitri Belikov, who was the leader of the
   team of guardians sent to retrieve the two, is assigned to be Lissa's
   guardian and offers to mentor Rose in her guardian training. He
   believes Rose can be an excellent guardian to Lissa due to the presence
   of a rare one-sided psychic bond to Lissa, which allows her to know the
   latter's thoughts, emotions, and whereabouts. Rose agrees, knowing this
   is the only way she will be allowed to remain, and on graduation, be
   Lissa's guardian. It is revealed that Lissa has a miraculous ability to
   heal others but when she becomes depressed she engages in
   self-mutilation. Lissa becomes friends with an outcast Moroi classmate,
   Christian Ozera whom Rose immediately dislikes, stating that he is a
   bad influence, partly because his parents voluntarily became Strigoi.
   The girls are bullied frequently by a non-royal named Mia along with
   her royal friends, because of her grudge against Lissa's brother for
   using her. Rose reaches through her bond while confined to her room to
   find that Lissa is being kidnapped. She sneaks out of her room to tell
   Dimitri that Lissa has been kidnapped, but they are distracted by a
   lust charm planted by Victor Dashkov, close uncle-figure of Lissa and
   father of Natalie Dashkov. Natalie is Lissa's roommate at the academy,
   as well as Lissa and Rose's friend. After Dimitri disposes of the
   charm, Rose directs a convoy to the kidnapper's hideout, with Christian
   stowing away during the ride. The school guardians are able to rescue
   Lissa from the moroi man she has called "Uncle" all her life, Victor,
   and she heals Christian when he is severely injured during the
   struggle. Lissa accepts him as her boyfriend after that. Dimitri
   reveals that he has feelings for Rose but cannot have a relationship
   with her because of their age difference, because he is her mentor and
   also because he worries that if he lets himself love her, he wouldn't
   throw himself in front of the princess, as is his duty, but he would be
   inclined to protect her. This may lead to danger to their assigned
   Moroi. It is revealed Natalie had been spying on the girls and
   reporting back to Victor about Lissa's magical abilities and the bond
   between Lissa and Rose. Rose is attacked by a Strigoi when visiting
   Victor in his cell after he is caught, and Dimitri comes to help her.

   The story continues in Frostbite with Rose and Dimitri traveling to
   meet Arthur Schoenberg for Rose's Qualifier Exam. Once they arrive at
   the home of the Moroi family- Conta- he protects, they discover a
   bloody massacre of the entire family and their guardians, including
   Arthur. To keep the students at St. Vladimir's Academy safe, a ski trip
   to a lodge owned by a wealthy Moroi family is offered over winter break
   since many of the students families wouldn't be able to bring their
   students home safely and they won't all fit on the academy campus to
   visit for the holidays. During her stay at the lodge, Rose meets a
   royal Moroi named Adrian Ivashkov, who flirts with her every time he
   sees her. During a pool party that Adrian invites Rose and her friends
   to, including Mason, his friend Eddie, and Mia, the friends begin
   voicing their opinions about hunting Strigoi. Rose breaks up a fight
   between two royal moroi, one who is later revealed to be Adrian's
   father, when they argue about using magic for self defense to help the
   guardians in the war against the Strigoi. Rose has another encounter
   with Adrian. Later, after a heated argument with Dimitri over him
   deciding to go work for and have a relationship with Tasha Ozera,
   Christian's aunt, Rose tells Mason confidential information about the
   possible whereabouts of the Strigoi's hideouts despite Dimitri trusting
   her to keep this information quiet. Using Rose's information, Mia,
   Mason, and Eddie sneak out of the ski lodge and travel to Spokane,
   Washington, to hunt down the Strigoi themselves. Rose discovers their
   plan, and she and Christian follow to stop them. When they find the
   group, they are ambushed by Strigoi, who hold them captive for days.
   Rose eventually comes up with a plan to escape, and they all manage to
   get out of the house into the protection of the light, except Rose.
   Mason returns and attempts to help Rose, but the Strigoi snap his neck,
   killing him instantly. Rose defeats the Strigoi- with a blunt sword, in
   a rage over his death. Once back at St. Vladimir's, Rose receives two
   molnija marks for her Strigoi kills. Dimitri also tells her that his
   heart is with Rose and will never leave her for Tasha Ozera.

   Shadow Kiss begins with Rose preparing for the Qualifying Exam with the
   rest of the novices. Rose is assigned to Christian for her fieldwork,
   to her dismay. Christian is approached by Jesse Zeklos to join a secret
   "club" he and Ralf have started, Christian turns them down. Rose
   becomes suspicious, and tries to learn more about this club, which she
   later learns is called "Mana" from Adrian. Rose goes to meet with Queen
   Tatiana. She insists that Rose call off her "engagement" to Adrian.
   Tatiana then reveals that she has been planning a marriage between
   Adrian and Lissa. Lissa is approached by Jesse and Ralf to join Mana,
   and she accepts their invitation as a chance to spy on them, without
   Rose's knowing. Lissa is led into the woods and attacked by Jesse and
   the other members of Mana. Rose senses something is wrong and runs to
   Lissa's aid. She beats Lissa's attackers and Lissa tortures Jesse using
   Spirit. Rose realizes that whenever Lissa uses Spirit, dark emotions
   fill Lissa, which caused her to self-harm in the first book, and tells
   Lissa to let the dark emotion flow through their connection and into
   Rose. Lissa obeys, and Rose suddenly begins beating Jesse fiercely.
   Alberta and Dimitri appear, and Alberta has several guards take Jesse
   away, while ordering Dimitri to handle Rose, who is still in a manic
   state. After Dimitri comforts Rose, they sleep together in a cabin on
   the edge of the campus. When they start to go back to the school, they
   are attacked by a Strigoi. Dimitri sends Rose back to the school to
   warn the guardians. The guardians give Rose a stake and send her back
   to her dormitory, but she sneaks out to go after Christian. She and
   Christian combine their skills to destroy Strigoi. They go on a rescue
   mission and are almost close to winning when Dimitri is attacked and
   Rose later finds out that his body wasn't found. The ghost of Mason,
   who has been seen by Rose throughout the book, reveals that Dimitri was
   not killed, but was made Strigoi. Rose decides to leave the Academy,
   against Lissa's wishes to go after Dimitri and kill him. She borrows
   money from Adrian with the promise of returning to him once her job is
   done. She then decides to go to Siberia, believing Dimitri would go
   there first.

   In Blood Promise, Rose meets an Alchemist named Sydney and they travel
   to Siberia, where she eventually finds Dimitri's family...and meets Abe
   Mazur, a Moroi mobster. She eventually leaves after a falling out with
   Dimitri's sister Viktoria. She then travels to Novosibirsk to hunt and
   interrogate Strigoi in the hopes of finding Dimitri. When she does meet
   him, he takes her hostage and refuses to kill her. Instead, he says he
   will keep her until she decides to turn Strigoi to be with him. All the
   while, Rose keeps checking up with Lissa back at St. Vladimir's through
   the bond. Avery, a secret Spirit user, has been using compulsion to
   control Lissa. During a visit to Lissa's mind, Rose gets pushed out by
   Avery. Rose eventually manages to escape, grabbing a stake on the way
   out. Dimitri catches up with her, and they battle on a bridge, where
   Rose plunges her stake into his chest. Exhausted, Rose ends up at the
   home of an Alchemist friend of Sydney's, and Abe is there too. When she
   wakes up, she realizes Lissa is in danger with Avery, who wants to kill
   Lissa and then heal her back so that Lissa would be "shadow-kissed" and
   bonded to Avery. With help from Oksana, Rose manages to guide Lissa and
   Adrian through the fight against Avery and her brother, Reed, and
   Avery's guardian Simon. Abe gets her a plane ticket home. Back at St.
   Vladimir's, Rose reunites with Lissa and shares what happened to her in
   Russia. After agreeing to re-enroll in school to graduate, Rose goes
   back to her normal life at St. Vladmir's. However, she soon receives a
   package from Russia, enclosed with the stake she used on Dimitri, and a
   note from him saying he was not really staked properly, and is still
   alive, waiting for Rose to finish school to find him. Rose realizes
   that with Dimitri still a Strigoi, she has a chance to restore him to
   his former life.

   Spirit Bound begins with Rose passing her final exams. She plots with
   Lissa and Eddie to break Victor Dashkov out of his high security
   vampire prison. Once they succeed, Victor agrees to lead them to his
   brother, Robert, a reclusive spirit user who is rumored to have once
   returned a Strigoi to their original state. Robert tells them that the
   Spirit user must infuse a stake with Spirit and kill the Strigoi on its
   own. Lissa and Christian are kidnapped by Dimitri as bait for Rose.
   Rose leads a group of guardians to his hiding place and fights her way
   over to him. She is about to kill him when Christian encircles him in a
   ring of fire, while Lissa stakes him. Dimitri is restored as a Dhampir.
   He pushes Rose away, saying that he is no longer able to love. Rose
   turns to Adrian for comfort. The next morning at breakfast, Rose and
   Dimitri run into each other. In the middle of the discussion, a group
   of Guardians surround Rose, and Dimitri instinctively fights to protect
   her, but she calms him down. The Guardians announce her that Queen
   Tatiana has been found murdered with Rose's stake and she is to come
   with them.

   Last Sacrifice starts with Rose being broken out of prison. Dimitri and
   Rose go to West Virginia with Sydney and decide to find Lissa's
   half-sibling. The only person with the information they need in an old
   teacher, Sonya Karp, who is now a Strigoi. Victor and Robert join them
   and Robert stakes Sonya, turning her back into a Moroi. Rose then takes
   Sonya to find Lissa's half-sibling. They discover it is Jill Mastrano,
   an old friend from the academy. Victor and Robert kidnap her.
   Meanwhile, Lissa is put in the running for Queen. Rose, Dimitri and
   Sonya find Victor and Robert and get Jill back, but Rose accidentally
   kills Victor during a fight. Dimitri comforts her and they confess
   their love for one another. They then make love again in a luxurious
   hotel. It is revealed that Tasha murdered the Queen as she disliked her
   policies, and framed Rose because she was jealous of her relationship
   with Dimitri. Tasha shoots Rose while attempting to escape. When she
   recovers, she is no longer bonded with Lissa. The series ends with
   Lissa becoming Queen and Dimitri and Rose together.
