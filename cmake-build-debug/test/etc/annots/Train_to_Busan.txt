   A chemical leak at a biotech plant causes the start of a zombie
   apocalypse that rapidly spreads across South Korea.

   Fund manager Seo Seok-woo is a cynical workaholic and divorced father.
   His daughter Su-an wants to spend her birthday with her mother in
   Busan. He tries to soothe her with the gift of a Wii, forgetting that
   she already has one. Overcome with guilt after watching a video of
   Su-an suffering from stage fright while singing the Hawaiian song
   "Aloha 'Oe" at a recital he could not attend, he decides to take her to
   Busan via an early KTX 101 train from Seoul Station. Other passengers
   include working-class man Yoon Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife
   Seong-kyeong; selfish COO Yon-suk; a high school baseball team that
   includes baseball player Min Yong-guk and cheerleader Kim Jin-hee;
   train attendant Ki-chul; elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil; and a
   homeless stowaway.

   As the train departs, signs of chaos from the infection reach the
   station, and an infected woman runs aboard, unnoticed, just before the
   doors close. She soon turns into a zombie, attacks an attendant, and
   many crew and passengers are quickly turned into zombies. The remaining
   passengers secure themselves in the front and rear cars, observing that
   the infected zombies only attack if they can see them or hear them, but
   they cannot operate the train's doors. They learn from news reports of
   the rapidly-spreading epidemic across the country, and Seok-woo
   discovers the biotech plant was connected to his business. He uses his
   connections to try to secure safe travels for Su-an and himself.

   The train stops at Daejeon Station, supposedly secured by the South
   Korean Army. The passengers disembark into a vacant station, but soon
   find the soldiers have become zombies, who quickly charge the group.
   Several passengers are attacked and killed as they race back to the
   train, while most of the surviving ones safely board the front cars.
   Su-an, Seong-kyeong, In-gil, and the homeless man find themselves
   between two cars of zombies and manage to take shelter in the
   restrooms. Seok-woo, Yong-guk, Sang-hwa and two of Yong-guk's three
   surviving classmates, having stayed back to provide cover, race to
   board the moving train, though Yong-guk's friends are killed and
   infected during the escape, and end up in the back cars. The captain
   drives the train to Busan after learning it has been established as a
   quarantine zone.

   Learning of their trapped loved ones, Seok-woo's group uses the
   darkness of tunnels along the route to cross through the zombie-filled
   cars and rescue them. The group continues moving towards the safe front
   cars but inadvertently alerts the zombies in the last car before the
   safe one. Seok-woo and Sang-hwa stay back to hold the doors closed
   while the others escape, but Yon-suk has convinced Ki-chul and the
   other passengers that they are potentially infected and they should not
   help. Sang-hwa sacrifices himself to give Seok-woo time to get the
   others to safety. In-gil is too slow and is caught by the zombies.

   Yon-suk and Ki-chul lead the other passengers in the front cars to
   force Seok-woo's group into a closed vestibule, believing them
   infected. Jong-gil, shaken by the passengers' selfishness, lets the
   zombies into the front car, killing the other survivors, though Yon-suk
   and Ki-chul manage to escape into a restroom. The train is forced to
   stop near East Daegu train station due to a blocked track, forcing the
   survivors to seek a new train. Yon-suk, in his escape, pushes Ki-chul,
   Jin-hee and the captain into a pack of zombies; Yong-guk stays with
   Jin-hee until she reanimates and kills him. An out-of-control train
   causes a derailment, trapping Seok-woo, Su-an, Seong-kyeong, and the
   homeless man under a train car. The homeless man sacrifices himself to
   hold back a zombie horde while the others escape out a small hole,
   finding a working locomotive. After releasing a train from a horde of
   zombies holding it back, they head toward Busan, when a zombified
   Yon-suk attacks Seok-woo and bites him before Seok-woo can throw him
   from the engine. Knowing he will turn, he quickly teaches Seong-kyeong
   how to operate the train and says his farewells to his sobbing daughter
   before throwing himself off the engine.

   Seong-kyeong and Su-an are forced to stop at a blocked tunnel just
   before Busan and walk. At the tunnel's exit, military snipers prepare
   to fire until they hear Su-an sob singing "Aloha 'Oe". They then
   realize that the pair are human, and help them to safety.
