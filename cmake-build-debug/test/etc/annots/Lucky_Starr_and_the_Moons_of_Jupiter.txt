   For six years, Jupiter IX has been the site of a secret project to
   develop an antigravity, or Agrav, space drive; but the Council of
   Science learns that information from the project is released to the
   enemy Sirians. A month after returning from Mercury, protagonists David
   "Lucky" Starr and John Bigman Jones are sent to Jupiter IX to
   investigate, bringing a V-frog to aid the investigation.

   Upon reaching IX, Starr and Bigman are warned away by the head of the
   project, Commander Donahue, who argues the men on the project are angry
   at investigation and may threaten Starr's safety. Starr and Bigman land
   nevertheless, and are met by a large group of workers led by a man
   named Red Summers, who insists that Starr take part in a duel in an
   Agrav corridor against a much larger man called Big Armand. During the
   duel, Bigman realizes Summers is sabotaging Starr's Agrav harness and
   forces Summers to stop at gunpoint, whereupon Starr wins the duel and
   gains Big Armand's friendship.

   At their quarters, Starr and Bigman are met by their neighbor, a blind
   man named Harry Norrich, who tells Starr that Summers is a convict on
   Earth, but has earned responsibility on the project, and is hostile to
   Starr for fear of having his past crimes revealed; whereas when
   Norrich's seeing-eye dog died, Summers obtained another, a German
   Shepherd named Mutt, and has done similar favors for other workers on
   the project. Starr assures Norrich that he has no intention of getting
   Summers in trouble for the duel.

   The next morning someone kills the V-frog while both men are
   distracted; whereafter Starr and Bigman tell Donahue and James Panner,
   the chief engineer on the project, that because the V-frog
   telepathically induced affection in all whom it met, only a robot,
   immune to emotion, could have killed it. It is then suggested that the
   Sirians are using android spies throughout the Solar System.

   Donahue, unconvinced, orders the launch of an Agrav ship, the Jovian
   Moon, to Io the following evening, and forbids Starr to conduct his
   investigation until after it returns. The Jovian Moon lifts off on
   schedule, its crew of seventeen including Donahue, Panner, Summers,
   Norrich, Mutt, Starr, and Bigman; the latter included because Starr
   believes the spy is on board.

   On Io, Bigman falls into an ammonial river, and is rescued by Mutt.
   After lift-off from Io, the Agrav drive fails, leaving the Jovian Moon
   falling towards Jupiter. Starr manages to land the ship on Amalthea,
   where they find that Red Summers is missing. An investigation reveals
   that Summers tricked Norrich into reporting him present on the ship
   while he was still on Io, whereupon Starr realizes that the Sirians had
   two agents planted in the Agrav project: the still-hidden robot spy,
   and the Earthman traitor Summers.

   Panner repairs the Agrav, and the Jovian Moon returns to Io, where
   Starr and Bigman locate Summers. Summers admits to working for the
   Sirians, but kills himself before revealing the identity of the robot
   spy. When Norrich helps bury Summers, Starr accuses him of being the
   robot, and Bigman threatens to shoot him; whereupon Mutt, coming to
   defend Norrich, is revealed as the robot himself.

   With the exposure of Mutt, Starr discerns that the Sirian spy ring on
   Earth must be the people who supplied Summers with Mutt, and who may be
   giving canid robot spies to others on Earth, and sets out to prevent
   them.
