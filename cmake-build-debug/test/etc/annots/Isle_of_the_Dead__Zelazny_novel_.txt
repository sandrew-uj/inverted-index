   Francis Sandow is the last surviving human born in the 20th century. An
   early space colonist, he spent long centuries of space travel in
   suspended animation. After his last such trip, he woke in the 27th
   century, where everything had changed. Desperate for something to hold
   to, he sought out a mentor, who happened to be a member of a very
   long-lived and slowly dying alien race, the Pei'ans. Under this
   tutelage, Sandow eventually became a telepath and "worldscaper".
   Worldscapers have the ability to create and/or terraform planets. The
   process of becoming a worldscaper culminates in a mystic rite called
   Naming that binds the mortal to one of the gods in the Pei'an pantheon,
   and it is believed that the worldscaper is actually acting as an avatar
   for the god. There are only twenty-seven existing worldscapers; Sandow,
   bound to Shimbo of Darktree, Shrugger of Thunders, is the only
   non-Pei'an among them. Outworlders are welcome to practice the
   religion, which is called Strantri. Sandow opines it will be the first
   major religion to outlive its founders. Unlike most of the Pei'an
   deities, who tend to be chimeras like Egyptian gods, Shimbo is also
   unmistakably human, showing that the Pei'ans had visited Earth in the
   distant past.

   The rite of Naming was once reserved for the high priests of the Pei'an
   religion. Sandow is a confirmed agnostic as far as the objective
   existence of the gods is concerned. However, whenever he sits for a
   time in a Strantri shrine, the icon of Shimbo always lights up, and
   this happens simultaneously in every shrine in the galaxy.

   At the beginning of the novel, Sandow is one of the most famous men in
   the Galaxy, wealthy beyond imagination, living a life of seclusion and
   luxury in worlds he fashions according to his taste. But he is lured
   into action by a series of photographs sent to him anonymously, showing
   him old enemies, old friends, and old lovers--most of whom should be
   dead, but appearing in the photographs to be alive.

   The novel is partly a tribute to Ernest Hemingway and some of its
   meditative sequences are written in a Hemingway-like style. Through
   Sandow's narrative, Zelazny presents observations on 20th-century
   American culture and how it has changed as other planets are created or
   discovered. An episode in a luxurious city of an earth colony leads to
   a rant on gratuities, for example.

   Eventually Sandow makes his way to Illyria, a world he created as an
   idyllic paradise, but finds it has been severely damaged. The enemy is
   a Pei'an rival who as an orthodox member of the faith feels that
   Sandow's Naming was sacrilege. The ultimate conflict takes place on the
   Isle of the Dead, at the center of a great lake. It is a replica of
   Arnold Boecklin's famous Isle of the Dead painting.

   Sandow also appears as a character in To Die in Italbar (1973) and the
   short story "Dismal Light" in the collection Unicorn Variations.
