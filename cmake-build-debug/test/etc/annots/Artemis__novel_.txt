   In Artemis, the first city on the Moon, porter and part-time smuggler
   Jasmine "Jazz" Bashara is offered an opportunity by a regular client,
   wealthy businessman Trond Landvik, to assist him with a new business
   venture. While meeting with Trond, Jazz briefly encounters an associate
   of his named Jin Chu who attempts to conceal a case marked with the
   name ZAFO. Trond intends to take over Sanchez Aluminum, which currently
   enjoys a lucrative permanent contract with the city for free energy in
   exchange for providing the city's entire oxygen supply as a by-product
   from aluminum production. Trond asks Jazz to sabotage the company's
   anorthite harvesters so he can step in with his own, and when he offers
   her a life-changing sum of money to carry out the criminal activity,
   Jazz accepts.

   Jazz borrows some welding equipment from her estranged father Ammar,
   and a small robot called a HIB from a business associate of his. She
   visits the Apollo 11 landing site as a tourist in disguise, leaving the
   HIB in place outside the airlock so that it can open the hatch for her
   without the assistance of a human EVA master. The next day, while an
   electronic device created by her scientist friend Martin Svoboda makes
   it seem as though she is in her living quarters, Jazz treks across the
   moon's surface to where the harvesters are collecting ore. She
   successfully sabotages one, but is spotted by the camera of another.
   Jazz destroys two more, but flees to avoid capture by an approaching
   EVA team before she is able to disable the last harvester. With EVA
   masters guarding every airlock, Jazz is discovered by her former friend
   Dale, whom she despises for stealing her boyfriend. Dale offers not to
   report her if she puts aside her resentment and tries to rekindle their
   friendship, which she reluctantly agrees to. Finding Trond and his
   bodyguard murdered, Jazz looks for Jin Chu at an expensive hotel. She
   is attacked by Trond's assassin, but manages to escape with Jin's ZAFO
   case, which she gives to Svoboda for study. Jazz learns that Sanchez
   Aluminum is a front for O Palacio, Brazil's largest and most powerful
   organized crime syndicate, and that the killer, named Alvares, is now
   after her. Jin agrees to meet Jazz, but betrays her to Alvares to save
   himself. Jazz, anticipating Jin's deception, executes a trap she has
   set, incapacitating Alvares, and then turns him over to the city's de
   facto police chief, Rudy.

   Svoboda discovers that ZAFO is a virtually lossless cable ("Zero
   Attenuation Fiber Optic"), which will allow long-distance transmission
   of data without the need for repeaters, revolutionizing communications
   infrastructure. As the manufacturing process requires low gravity,
   Artemis is an ideal location, and the new industry would significantly
   boost the city's stagnant economy. Jazz confronts the city's
   administrator Ngugi, who reveals she has been using Jazz as bait to
   flush out O Palacio's operatives, not wanting to allow Artemis to be
   taken over by a crime syndicate. Jazz then enlists her reluctant
   friends and father to stop O Palacio by destroying Sanchez's smelter,
   which will allow Trond's daughter Lene, who inherited his fortune, to
   seize the pertinent contracts and rebuild. Dale helps Jazz break into
   the plant, where she sabotages the smelter to overheat and destroy
   itself, but in doing so unwittingly creates deadly chloroform that is
   pumped into the city's air supply. With under an hour before the
   unconscious residents of Artemis die from their exposure, Jazz races to
   access Trond's stockpile of untainted oxygen. She sacrifices herself to
   save the city, but Dale is able to save her. Lene pays Jazz for her
   services, and she finds herself temporarily wealthy. After buying her
   father a new welding workshop to replace the one she accidentally
   destroyed as a teenager, Jazz is called to Ngugi's office, where the
   administrator informs her of her impending deportation. Jazz convinces
   Ngugi of her value to the city as an "authorized" harmless smuggler
   whose monopoly of the illegal trade keeps out other more dangerous
   criminals. Ngugi relents, but forces her to pay most of her remaining
   money to the city as a fine. Jazz and Dale then rekindle their
   friendship. Jazz tasks Kelvin, her smuggling partner on Earth, to
   discover which company Jin Chu works for and invest in it before ZAFO
   and its earning potential is announced.
