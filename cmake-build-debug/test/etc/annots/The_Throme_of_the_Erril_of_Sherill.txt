   Magnus Thrall, King of Everywhere, welters away in misery, pining for
   the nonexistent Throme, supposedly written by the Erril of Sherill ages
   past in another world. In his suffering he will not allow anyone around
   him to know happiness, including his weeping daughter Damsen, who
   yearns for the world outside the castle, and his loyal Chief Cnite
   Caerles, who seeks Damsen's hand. The king refuses to allow the match
   unless Caerles finds him the Throme.

   So in an atypical quest, the Cnite goes in quest for what the king
   demands. With small hope of success, he seeks it in various strange
   places, only to be misdirected and receive confusing advice as he in
   turn gradually loses his sword, shield and armor. He borrows a dagon
   from a girl named Elfwyth, falls victim to a boy's borebel trap, and is
   cautioned against the cold-hearted Lady Gringold by a jingler in a
   norange orchard. He visits the Mirk-Well of Morg, the Floral Wold, the
   Dolorous House of the dead Dolerman, and, in the end, the Western
   Wellsprings, repository of the answer to Everything.

   Ultimately, he solves his dilemma in an imaginative way by writing his
   own Throme from "the tales and dreams and happenings of his quest."
