   The Stones, a family of "Loonies" (residents of the Moon, known as
   "Luna" in the book, from the Roman goddess), purchase and rebuild a
   used spaceship and go sightseeing around the Solar System.

   The twin teenage boys, named Castor and Pollux after the half-brothers
   of classical legend, buy used bicycles on Luna to sell on Mars, their
   first stop, where they run afoul of local regulations but are freed by
   their grandmother Hazel Stone. While on Mars, the twins buy their
   brother Buster a native Martian creature called a flat cat, which
   produces a soothing vibration, as a pet.

   In preparation for the asteroid belt, where the equivalent of a gold
   rush is in progress prospecting for "core material" and radioactive
   ores, the twins obtain supplies and luxury goods on Mars to sell at
   their destination, on the principle that it is shopkeepers, not miners,
   who get rich during gold rushes. En route, the flat cat and its
   offspring overpopulate the ship so the family places them in
   hibernation and later sells them to the miners.

   The novel ends with the family setting out to see the rings of Saturn.
