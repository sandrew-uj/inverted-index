   In the year AD 8054, the Stellar Patrol Scoutship Starfire has crashed
   in a desert on an Earth-like planet. The planet's atmosphere, gravity,
   and solar radiation are almost ideal for the Rangers and Patrolmen. On
   initial examination, there are no signs of civilization. After burying
   their dead, the survivors set up a camp in a forest beside a river.

   One night, one of the men notices the bright beam of a beacon sweeping
   across the sky. Ranger Sergeant Kartr and Ranger Rolth take the aerial
   sled to investigate. They find an abandoned city lit up as if it were
   inhabited. There they meet Joyd Cummi, an Ageratan Vice-Sector Lord who
   has come to the city with almost two hundred people from a starliner
   that has made an emergency landing nearby.

   Against Kartr's advice, the Patrol's ranking officer decides that the
   Patrolmen and Rangers will move to the city and join the other
   refugees. Not trusting Cummi, the Rangers take up residence in a tower
   isolated from the buildings occupied by the starliner's passengers and
   crew. Soon Kartr and the others discover that all is not well in the
   Cummi dictatorship.

   Inspired by the arrival of the Patrol, the rebels begin their revolt,
   and the Rangers are drawn into the battle. With their expertise, the
   Patrolmen and Rangers help the rebels win the fight. Cummi flees the
   city, taking telepathic control of Kartr's body and uses him to fly the
   Rangers' aerial sled.

   Kartr wakes up on the ground in a rainstorm. The surviving Patrolmen
   and Rangers soon find him and take him to their new camp. Several days
   later, Katr and his Zacathan friend search for Cummi, beginning at the
   wreckage of the sled. In the wilderness, they rescue an injured boy and
   take him to his clan's camp, where Kartr must confront Cummi. In a
   mind-to-mind battle, Cummi succumbs to the hideous disease that he has
   spread to the natives.

   Kartr and the other refugees decide to avoid the natives, lest they
   spread even more disease. With nothing else to do and faint hope of
   finding an intact spaceship, they set out to find the Meeting Place of
   the Gods that the native boy mentioned to Kartr. When they come to that
   sacred place, they see a building that looks exactly like the Place of
   Free Planets in the Imperial capital, but much older. Inside the
   building, they find the legendary, almost mythical Hall of Leave-Taking
   and realize that the planet on which they stand is Terra of Sol, old
   Earth, the original home of humanity.

   As they marvel at the discovery, a band of refugees from a Stellar
   Patrol base which was destroyed by pirates joins them. As ranking
   officer, Kartr asks for a vote on whether to return to the city or try
   to live in the wilderness. The people vote unanimously for a new start,
   and Kartr leads them into their future.
