   The opening installment of The Puppet Masters took the cover of the
   September 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction

   In the summer of 2007, Earth is under clandestine attack. Slug-like
   creatures, arriving in flying saucers, are attaching themselves to
   people's backs, taking control of their victims' nervous systems, and
   manipulating those people as puppets. The Old Man, the head of a
   clandestine national security agency called the Section, goes to Des
   Moines, Iowa, with Sam and Mary, two of his best agents, to investigate
   a flying saucer report, but much more seriously the ominous
   disappearance of the six agents sent previously. They discover that the
   slugs are steadily taking over Des Moines, but they cannot convince the
   US president to declare an emergency.

   Sam takes two other agents and returns to Des Moines to get more
   evidence of the invasion. They fail and are obliged to leave the city
   quickly, but in the confusion of their fleeing the city's television
   center, a slug sneaks onto one of the agents. Back in Washington the
   team discovers the slug and captures it, but later it escapes and
   attaches itself to Sam, using Sam's skills and knowledge to make a
   clean escape.

   Thoroughly puppetized, Sam begins to infiltrate more slugs into the
   city, using the Constitution Club - whose membership includes many
   important members of the city's political elite - as a recruiting
   center. The Old Man captures him, takes him to Section's new
   headquarters, and coerces Sam into being taken by the slug again. Under
   drug-induced hypnosis Sam reveals that the slugs come from Titan, the
   sixth moon of Saturn. Being forced into a traumatic situation strains
   Sam's relationship with both Mary and the Old Man. Later, Sam finds
   that the President and Congress are ready to accept the idea that the
   United States has been infiltrated and they mandate a law that requires
   people to go naked to demonstrate that they are not carrying slugs.

   As the US Army prepares a counter-attack in the most heavily infested
   areas, Sam goes alone to Kansas City to get an estimate of the number
   of slugs involved. There he learns that he can kill a slug by crushing
   it with his hand. He also discovers that the slugs reproduce through
   fission - which means that there are far more of them then the army
   realized when making its plans, and therefore the plan is doomed to
   failure. Escaping from the city, he returns to Washington too late to
   stop the counter-attack, which fails; the invading soldiers are either
   killed or captured by the slugs, who thus gain control of a corps of
   trained combat soldiers.

   After a short leave, during which they get married and have a brief
   happy honeymoon - rudely interrupted by a slug that seems to have been
   targeting Sam for repossession and whom they very barely manage to
   kill. Recalled to ugly reality, Sam and Mary return to work. Together
   with the Old Man, they go to Pass Christian, Mississippi to inspect a
   flying saucer that had made a bad landing. Inside the alien ship Mary
   is overwhelmed by repressed memories from the time she was a child on
   Venus and had been possessed by a slug. The slug had died from Nine-day
   Fever, a severe disease native to Venus, but Mary, luckily, had
   survived the disease.

   Adopting biological warfare, the authorities culture Nine-day Fever and
   its cure in bulk sufficient to cover the country, and then infected
   slugs are allowed to escape into the heavily infested areas. Several
   days later thousands of medics are landed in those areas to give the
   cure to those people whose slugs have died. Sam and the Old Man join
   the effort in Jefferson City, Missouri, but the Old Man is possessed by
   the last healthy slug in the city and he knocks Sam out.

   Sam regains consciousness in an air-car that the Old Man is flying to
   the Yucatan, where the slug intends to restart its effort to conquer
   Humanity. With the car on autopilot, the Old Man slumps over the
   steering wheel and the slug begins to fission so that it can possess
   both the Old Man and Sam. In desperation, Sam kicks the controls,
   causing the air-car to accelerate so sharply that the Old Man is
   slammed back against the seat forcefully enough to crush the slug. The
   air-car's emergency system mitigates the resulting crash and Sam and
   the Old Man wait to be rescued.

   Some years later Sam and Mary board a spaceship headed for Saturn on a
   mission to exterminate the slugs (or at least deliver a serious blow
   and blunt their appetite for conquest). Sam expresses the hope that a
   way would be found to save the small elf-like inhabitants of Titan,
   whom the slugs enslaved before they turned their attention to other
   planets and with whom Humanity "might get along".

   While the invasion was decisively defeated in the US territory, the
   situation in the rest of the world remains unclear. There is a
   reference to the slugs having invaded and effectively taken over the
   Eastern Bloc, some months before invading the United States - but their
   ignoring basic hygiene had caused a major outbreak of Bubonic Plague,
   leading to a total breakdown of public order in both Russia and China.
   It remains unclear, however, if that had the same effect of eliminating
   the slugs as the planned biological warfare resorted to by the
   Americans. Sam is seen remarking cynically that "it makes no real
   difference" - evidently, whether or not the Soviet Union is dominated
   by slugs, the Cold War will continue.

   There is also a reference to Britain refusing to follow the US in
   having its citizens strip down - though the King was willing to go
   along, the Anglican Church put a veto on the idea - which means that
   Britain might be taken over by the slugs. The book makes no mention of
   what the US would do about that.
