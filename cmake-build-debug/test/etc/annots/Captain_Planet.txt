     Our world is in peril. Gaia, the spirit of the Earth, can no longer
     stand the terrible destruction plaguing our planet. She sends five
     magic rings to five special young people: Kwame, from Africa, with
     the power of Earth... From North America, Wheeler, with the power of
     Fire... From Eastern Europe, Linka, with the power of Wind. From
     Asia, Gi, with the power of Water... and from South America, Ma-Ti,
     with the power of Heart. When the five powers combine, they summon
     Earth's greatest champion, Captain Planet.

   -- Opening Narration

   Every episode is followed up with at least one "Planeteer Alert" clip,
   often connected to the plot, where environmental-political and other
   social-political issues are discussed and how the viewer can contribute
   and be part of "the solution" rather than "the pollution".
