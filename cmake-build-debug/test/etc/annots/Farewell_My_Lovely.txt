   Private detective Philip Marlowe is investigating a dead-end missing
   person case when he sees a felon, Moose Malloy, barging into a
   nightclub called Florian's, looking for his ex-girlfriend Velma
   Valento. The club has changed owners, so no one now there knows her.
   Malloy ends up killing the black owner of the club and escaping. The
   murder case is assigned to Lt. Nulty, a Bay City police detective who
   has no interest in the murder of a black man. Marlowe advises Nulty to
   look for Malloy's girlfriend, but Nulty prefers to let Marlowe do the
   routine legwork and rely on finding Malloy based on his huge size and
   loud clothes. Marlowe decides to follow up and look for the girl.

   He tracks down Mrs Jessie Florian, the widow of the nightclub's former
   owner, and plies her with bourbon. Mrs Florian claims Malloy's
   girlfriend is dead. Before making further progress, Marlowe receives a
   call from a man named Lindsay Marriott, who claims his friend has been
   robbed and requests Marlowe's presence in delivering a ransom payment
   for stolen jewellery. Later that evening, in a deserted canyon, Marlowe
   waits in the dark and is hit on the head from behind. When he awakes,
   Marriott is dead. A passerby, Anne Riordan, finds him and takes him
   home.

   Lt. Randall, the cunning but honest Los Angeles cop investigating
   Marriott's murder, is skeptical about the story. At Marlowe's office,
   Anne explains that she is from Bay City, a policeman's daughter
   interested in local crime. Her father was cashiered by the corrupt cops
   running the Bay City Police. She tells Marlowe that she learned from
   Randall that the stolen necklace belongs to a Mrs Lewin Lockridge
   Grayle, the young wife of a wealthy and influential Bay City resident.
   Mrs Grayle is a ravishing blonde whom Grayle met when she was singing
   for the radio station he owned. She married him in Europe under an
   assumed name, to keep her background secret. Anne offers to have her
   hire Marlowe to find the necklace.

   Marlowe examines some marijuana cigarettes he found on Marriott's body
   and discovers the card of a psychic, Jules Amthor. He makes an
   appointment to see him. On a hunch, he investigates Mrs. Florian's
   house and discovers that Marriott held a trust deed on it, meaning he
   could foreclose on her at will. Following up with Mrs Florian, she
   reveals she was once a servant for Marriott's family, and Marlowe
   suspects she was somehow blackmailing him. Marlowe visits Mrs Grayle,
   who finds him attractive and hires him, which he can use as an excuse
   to continue investigating the two murders. They make a date to meet
   again at the club of a local hoodlum, Laird Brunette, near the spot
   where Marriott was killed.

   At Amthor's office, Marlowe probes him for his connection to Marriott
   and the drugs. Amthor calls in a pair of Bay City detectives out of
   their jurisdiction to arrest Marlowe, claiming Marlowe tried to
   blackmail him, but instead of taking him to jail, they knock him
   unconscious and lock him up in a private hospital run by Dr.
   Sonderborg, a drug dealer who keeps him docile with drug injections.
   Marlowe escapes, but on the way out, he sees Malloy in another room. He
   discusses the case with Randall, who is annoyed at his persistence in
   investigating the case. They suspect Marriott of blackmailing wealthy
   women, in league with Amthor, and return to Mrs Florian's, only to find
   her murdered, apparently shaken to death by Malloy.

   Because of the involvement of the Bay City cops whom Amthor called in,
   Marlowe visits the corrupt Bay City police chief, John Wax, who brushes
   him off until Marlowe mentions that he has been hired by Mrs Grayle.
   Marlowe is then told that Malloy may be hiding out on a gambling boat
   anchored beyond the three-mile limit and run by Brunette, who also
   controls the corrupt city government in Bay City. Marlowe sneaks on
   board with the help of Red Norgaard, another honest cop fired by Bay
   City, and despite being caught by Brunette, persuades him to pass a
   message through his criminal network to Malloy.

   Marlowe calls Mrs Grayle, ostensibly to have her pick him up at his
   apartment for their date. Responding to Marlowe's message, Malloy shows
   up first, and hides when Mrs Grayle arrives. Marlowe confronts her: she
   is Velma and had used Marriott to keep Mrs Florian in line after she
   recognised Velma's voice on Grayle's radio station. Marriott had worked
   as an announcer at the same station. Mrs Grayle convinced Marriott to
   set up Marlowe to be killed in the canyon, but actually did so to kill
   Marriott because she viewed him as a 'weak link' who would reveal her
   secret past. She had also informed on Malloy about the robbery that
   sent him to prison. When Malloy hears this, he steps out to confront
   Velma, who shoots him fatally and flees. Amthor, Sonderborg, and the
   crooked cops are all exposed; Red gets his job back. Velma flees, but
   when she is eventually tracked down in Baltimore, she kills the
   detective who recognizes her, and commits suicide when cornered.
