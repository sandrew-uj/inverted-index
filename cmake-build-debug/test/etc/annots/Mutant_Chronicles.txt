   The game takes place in a distant future where the Earth has long since
   been depleted of natural resources and abandoned. Humanity has spread
   to the worlds of Venus, Mars, Mercury, Luna (the first settlement
   following the exodus from Earth), and the Asteroid belt.

   Since the exodus from Earth the traditional nation-states of the world
   have merged into five huge megacorporations: Bauhaus, styled after the
   culture of continental Europe, the American-influenced Capitol, the
   Japanese-themed Mishima, the British-inspired Imperial, and the
   ultra-secretive, ambiguous, high-tech wielding Cybertronic, all of whom
   use private military forces to fight for resources. Luna (the Moon)
   itself is considered to be neutral ground and is home to the massive
   city-state known as Luna City.

   The other major power of this universe is the Brotherhood, a fanatical
   religious organization formed to meet the threat of the Dark Legion, an
   ancient evil comprising five "Dark Apostles" and their horde of hideous
   mutants and undead. The Dark Legion is the corporeal presentation of
   the Dark Symmetry and minions of the Dark Apostles. The Dark Legion
   commands the most powerful armies of the solar system, including
   Legionnaires, resurrected corpses of fallen Megacorp heroes and
   footsoldiers alike; Necromutants, hideously modified humanoids;
   Centurions, the lethal lieutenants of the Dark Legion; and Nepharites,
   fearsome, towering behemoths of unimaginable power.

   The reign of the Dark Legion began as mankind set foot on Nero, a
   fictional tenth planet beyond the orbit of Pluto, where they discovered
   a citadel. As they entered, the Imperial Conquistadors - a group of
   interplanetary explorers - accidentally broke the First Seal Of
   Repulsion, a thin ring of salt spread around the citadel. Inside, a
   mysterious iron plate was found, and as it was touched, the Dark Legion
   was brought to our dimension, and along with it, the Dark Symmetry.

   The Dark Symmetry prevents computers, "thinking engines", and other
   electronic devices from functioning reliably, if at all, initially
   caused complete chaos, and then a forced adaptation of the technology
   used by mankind. The Dark Symmetry also begins to spread plagues, lies,
   illusions and war on the human population through Dark Apostles known
   as Demnogonis, Semai, Muawihje, Algeroth and Ilian, The Dark Mistress
   and most powerful wielder of The Dark Symmetry. Thus the first
   Corporate wars began. Only through the Brotherhood and its first
   Cardinal, Nathaniel Durand were the corporations pulled under one
   banner, driving the Dark Legion and Dark Symmetry back to the void
   where it came from.

   This however cost Nathaniel Durand his life as he fought and defeated
   Algeroth, the field commander of all of the Dark Legion and the master
   of Dark Technology. Dark Legion resurfaces as a millennium passes, old
   edicts to keep the evil at bay are broken and Megacorps begin the 2nd
   Corporate wars. Yet again Nero is explored and Dark Symmetry is
   unleashed. It was also during the period of 1000-year peace that
   Cybertronic surfaced and was the first to break one of the edicts;
   Humans must not create or use machines that think like man.
