   The Heroes of Olympus is centered around a prophecy, introduced in The
   Last Olympian, that predicted seven demigods would unite to protect the
   world from an awakening new enemy, Gaia. Demigods from both the Greek
   camp, Camp Half-Blood, and a newfound Roman camp, Camp Jupiter, unite
   to save the world from being destroyed by the terryifying Earth
   Goddess, Gaia. The prophecy reads:

   Seven half-bloods shall answer the call, (Hazel Levesque, Percy
   Jackson, Jason Grace, Annabeth Chase, Frank Zhang, Leo Valdez, Piper
   McLean)
   To storm or fire, the world must fall. (Leo's fire powers defeated a
   Roman leader who fought with Gaia, Octavian)
   An oath to keep with a final breath, (Leo's oath to come back to a
   magical island where his love waited)
   And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death. (The awakened giants and
   Tartarus guard the doors of death)

   Seven demigods--Annabeth Chase, Leo Valdez, Percy Jackson and Piper
   McLean from Camp Half-Blood, with Jason Grace, Frank Zhang, and Hazel
   Levesque from Camp Jupiter--join forces. A storm or a fire will destroy
   the world (Which means either Leo or Jason will have a terrible fate in
   store). The last line details how 2 demigods, a giant, and a titan will
   free the Doors of Death.

   Some other important characters are Nico di Angelo, Son of Hades, Reyna
   Avila Ramirez-Arellano, Praetor of Camp Jupiter and daughter of
   Bellona, and Gleeson Hedge, a satyr. In the books, they are the main
   people trying to bring peace between the Greeks and the Romans while
   the main 7 characters are fighting the main battle. Without their
   unity, it would be impossible to defeat Gaia and save the world. The
   books are set between winter and August, hypothetically in the year
   2009.
