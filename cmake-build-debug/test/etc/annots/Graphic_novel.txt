   A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word
   "novel" normally refers to long fictional works, the term "graphic
   novel" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and
   anthologized work. It is, at least in the United States, distinguished
   from the term "comic book", which is generally used for comics
   periodicals (see American comic book).

   Fan historian Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel" in an essay
   in the November 1964 issue of the comics fanzine Capa-Alpha.^[1]^[2]
   The term gained popularity in the comics community after the
   publication of Will Eisner's A Contract with God (1978) and the start
   of Marvel's Graphic Novel line (1982) and became familiar to the public
   in the late 1980s after the commercial successes of the first volume of
   Art Spiegelman's Maus in 1986, the collected editions of Frank Miller's
   The Dark Knight Returns in 1986 and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons'
   Watchmen in 1987. The Book Industry Study Group began using "graphic
   novel" as a category in book stores in 2001.^[3]
