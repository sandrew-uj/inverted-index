   Shadow is an ex-convict who is released from prison three days early
   when his wife Laura is killed in a car accident. Shadow is devastated
   by her death, and is distraught to learn that she died alongside his
   best friend Robbie, with whom she had been having an affair. He takes a
   job as a bodyguard for a mysterious con man, Mr. Wednesday, and travels
   with him across America, visiting Wednesday's acquaintances. Shadow
   learns that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin the All-Father, and
   that he is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods, whose
   powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number, to
   participate in a battle against the New American Gods - manifestations
   of modern life and technology, such as the Internet, media, and modern
   means of transport. Shadow meets a leprechaun named Mad Sweeney, who
   gives Shadow a magical gold coin after Shadow beats him in a fight.
   Shadow later tosses the coin into his wife's grave at her funeral,
   inadvertently bringing her back from the dead as a semi-living
   revenant.

   The New Gods abduct Shadow (utilizing a group of shadowy Men in Black,
   led by the mysterious Mr. World), but Laura rescues him, killing
   several Men in Black in the process. Wednesday hides Shadow, first with
   Mr. Ibis (Thoth) and Mr. Jacquel (Anubis), who run a funeral parlor in
   Cairo, Illinois, and then in the Wisconsin community of Lakeside. They
   are pursued all the while by the Men in Black, particularly Mr. Town,
   who blames Shadow for the death of his friends.

   The New Gods seek to parley with Wednesday, but murder him at the
   meeting. This act galvanizes the Old Gods, and they rally to face their
   enemies in battle at Rock City. While retrieving Wednesday's body,
   Shadow is surprised to discover his old prison cellmate and mentor, Low
   Key Lyesmith, is working as a driver for the New Gods. Shadow is bound
   by his contract with Wednesday to hold his vigil by re-enacting Odin's
   time hanging from a "World Tree" while pierced by a spear for nine
   days. During these nine days, he is visited by Horus, who has become
   mad from living too long as a hawk. Shadow dies and visits the land of
   the dead, where he is judged by Anubis. Shadow learns that he is
   Wednesday's (Odin's) son, conceived as part of the deity's plans.
   During this time, Mr. Town arrives at the World Tree, ordered by Mr.
   World to cut a branch from it.

   Horus finds Easter and convinces her to bring Shadow back to life.
   Shadow realizes Mr. World is actually Low Key (Loki) Lyesmith, and that
   Odin and Loki have been working a "two-man con". They orchestrated
   Shadow's birth, his meeting of Loki in disguise in prison, and even
   Laura's death. Loki had arranged for Odin's murder, thus making the
   battle between the New and Old Gods a sacrifice to Odin, restoring
   Odin's power, while also allowing Loki to feed on the chaos of the
   battle.

   Laura chooses to hitchhike to Rock City and meets Mr. Town, who does
   not realize who she is, and they agree to travel together. During their
   travels, Laura learns who Mr. Town is and, once they arrive at their
   destination, kills him and takes the branch he took from the World
   Tree. She then meets with Loki and manages to stab him with the World
   Tree branch, which turns into a spear as she stabs.

   Shadow arrives at Rock City and confronts Loki, now gravely wounded,
   and the ghost of Odin, who reveal their plans. Shadow travels to the
   site of the battle and explains that both sides have nothing to gain
   and everything to lose, with Odin and Loki as the only true winners.
   Shadow tells them the United States is a bad place for Gods, and he
   recommends they return home. The gods depart, Loki dies, and Odin's
   ghost fades. Laura asks Shadow to take the coin from her, which he
   does, and she finally dies.

   In Iceland, Shadow meets another incarnation of Odin (created by the
   belief of the original settlers of Iceland), who is much closer than
   Wednesday to the Odin of mythology. Shadow accuses Odin of Wednesday's
   actions, but Odin retorts: "He was me, yes. But I am not him." Shadow
   gives Wednesday's glass eye to Odin, which Odin places in a leather bag
   as a keepsake. Shadow performs a simple sleight-of-hand coin trick,
   which delights Odin, who asks for a repeat performance. Shadow then
   performs a small piece of real magic, pulling a golden coin from
   nowhere, before walking away from the god and out into the world.
