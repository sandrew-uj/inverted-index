   The book, as well as its sequels, follows the adventures of British
   historian and naturalist Jonah Lightfoot, who is caught in the eruption
   of Krakatoa in 1883. The blast transports him and American runaway
   Annie West into a vertical world consisting of a seemingly infinite
   wall populated by crumbling civilisations, weird creatures, and
   sentient dragons. No one knows where the wall begins or ends, and no
   one dares to climb to its top or fall to its base.

   This world is called Amara, and it is a place deeply entwined with our
   own world. Throughout the books Jonah and his companions traverse the
   world and uncover its many mysteries. The true nature of Amara is fully
   revealed in the second book of the trilogy, Stone and Sea.
