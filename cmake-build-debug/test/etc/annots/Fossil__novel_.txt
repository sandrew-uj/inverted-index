   On a medium-sized, low-gravity planet with a very slow rotational
   period, the side that is farthest from the sun is always a very hard
   mixture of frozen carbon dioxide, rock hard ammonia, and solid water
   ice, and the side that is closest, a sea of turbulent liquids and
   icebergs. The planet rotates so slowly that the part that is half ice
   and half ocean is constantly beset with troubling weather conditions,
   ranging from blizzards to unanticipated ice melts and earthquakes. It
   takes centuries if not thousands of years for the wobbling of the
   planet on the ecliptic to melt certain parts of the planet. Even still,
   it is possible for the planet to have become locked in orbit, so the
   farthest side never melts. The tidal locking of the planet may have
   occurred hundreds of millions of years ago, and seasons appear to be
   limited to the slight wobbling of the planet on the ecliptic. Far from
   being an uninteresting planet, the ecliptic along which the planet
   travels is also tilted. Most of the colonies are located along the
   "coast" - the place in a murky half-shadow of constant night and
   constant day.

   Scientific researchers from all kinds of alien species from all over
   the known universe have come to this planet to engage in an arduous
   archaeological expedition to unearth mysterious fossils from deep
   within the multi-kilometer thick icy crust. They have dug so deep that
   it is generally considered dangerous to dig any deeper. On some of the
   worlds around the galaxy, mysterious relics are found from an earlier
   civilization that no longer exists. Since the planet has almost no rock
   at its core, and enjoyed a rotational period for the first couple
   billion years of its existence, there is probably nothing to find here,
   short of fossils of earlier species once flourishing on the planet, but
   now extinct.
