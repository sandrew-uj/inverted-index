   Like several previous novels in the Barsoom series, Synthetic Men
   introduces a completely new character as its protagonist: Vor Daj, a
   padwar (warrior) from Helium and a member of John Carter's personal
   guard.^[2] Vor Daj narrates the action in the first person, so that
   when John Carter appears in the story, he is described in the third
   person (unlike other Barsoomian novels that feature Carter as the
   first-person narrator). The novel also brings back a familiar
   character, Ras Thavas, the amoral mad scientist from the earlier novel
   The Master Mind of Mars.

   John Carter and Vor Daj seek Thavas's surgical aid for Carter's wife
   Dejah Thoris, injured in an accident. Thavas, however, proves hard to
   find. Since the events of Master Mind he has transferred his base to a
   hidden location, which is ultimately found to be the dead city of
   Morbus in the Toonolian Marshes. There he has been experimenting in
   growing monstrous synthetic human beings called hormads. The most
   intelligent of these turn on him and force him to grow an army of
   hormads with which to conquer Barsoom. They also force their captive to
   transplant their brains into the bodies of imprisoned normal Martians.

   Captured by the hormads and imprisoned with Ras Thavas, Carter and Daj
   plot with the scientist against the synthetic man. Vor Daj's brain is
   transplanted into the body of a hormad named Tor-dur-bar to enable him
   to spy on their captors, and his adventures form the bulk of the story.
   He falls in love with a fellow captive, the red woman Janai of Amhor,
   but his love seems hopeless while his consciousness resides in the body
   of a monster, particularly after it seems that his original body has
   been destroyed.

   Meanwhile, Carter and Thavas escape; the latter cures Dejah Thoris, and
   the two ultimately return to Morbus with a great fleet of airships from
   Helium. Vor Daj is recovered and Morbus, which has been overrun by a
   huge mass of cancerously growing hormad flesh, is destroyed with
   incendiary bombs. Ras Thavas then restores Vor Daj to his original
   body, freeing him to wed Janai.
