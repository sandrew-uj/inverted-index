   May Bird lives alone with her mother and her cat, Somber Kitty (a
   Sphynx cat), on the edge of a wooded swamp in West Virginia. She loves
   to draw and make believe, but does not fit in at school. Most people
   are not very comfortable in the woods, but "The woods of Briery Swamp
   fit May Bird like a fuzzy mitten." There, she is safe from school and
   the taunts and teases of the kids who do not understand her. Hidden in
   the trees, May is a warrior princess, and her cat is her brave
   guardian. Then. May falls into the lake.

   When she crawls out, May finds herself in a world that is inhabited by
   things she thought were just in her imagination. She sees many ghosts
   and other amazing creatures. A ghost named Pumpkin (with a pumpkin
   head) is her house ghost, or her guardian, and follows her into the
   lake to help her through. So does her faithful cat after she does not
   return. It is a place few live ones (living people) have ever seen.
   "Here, towns glow blue beneath zipping stars and the people walk
   through walls." Here the Book of the Dead holds the answers to
   everything in the universe. And here, if May is discovered, the
   horrifyingly evil Bo Cleevil will destroy her. May Bird must get out.
   This is the beginning of May Bird's daring journey into the Ever After,
   a haunting place where true friends--and many terrible foes--await her
   on every corner. She gets help from Pumpkin, who lives with the
   Beekeeper Arista in a giant house shaped like a beehive. She is told
   that she needs to go see the Lady of North Farm, a place no ghost is
   willing to go.

   Along the journey May meets new friends and sees unimaginable sights
   and faces many strange adventures. The journey she is faced with is a
   journey that will forever be with her- whether she is dead or alive.
