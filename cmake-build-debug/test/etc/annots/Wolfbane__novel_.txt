   This science fiction novel takes place in the year 2203, if we take
   literally the age of 250 years given for a Korean War identity bracelet
   that is dated 1953. A rogue planet, populated by strange machines known
   as Pyramids, has stolen the Earth from the Solar system, taking it off
   into interstellar space. The moon has been 'ignited' by alien
   technology to serve as a miniature sun around which both planets orbit.
   This new sun is rekindled every 5 years, though as the book opens, the
   rekindling is nearly overdue and there is fear among the populace that
   it may never happen again.

   The global population has crashed to a hundred million, due largely to
   the radical climate changes that followed the arrival of the alien
   planet. Most of the surviving humans are 'Citizens,' passive people
   living lives bound up with elaborate social rituals, various styles of
   meditation, and carefully prescribed selflessness. This constraining
   lifestyle frequently causes Citizens to succumb to mental breakdowns
   and run 'amok,' attacking anyone within reach. Persons who commit this
   or any other crime face ritual execution.

   A small minority of the population who retain their aggressive natures
   are referred to as 'Wolves.' They are considered to be a direct threat
   to the rest of society. These Wolves, however, generally see themselves
   as superior humans and refer to the Citizens as 'Sheep.' This labeling
   system is somewhat ironic, because the Wolves generally try to trick
   the Sheep into avoiding their settlements, while any Wolf who is caught
   by the Sheep is murdered.

   The Pyramid aliens' motives are unknown, their only visible presence
   being a lone Pyramid perched atop a leveled-off Mount Everest and the
   transparent 'Eyes' which form over individuals who have supposedly
   attained or approached a state of meditative perfection or 'Nirvana.'
   Persons who reach this stage of meditation vanish from the world to an
   unknown destination.
