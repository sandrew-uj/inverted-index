   According to the series, rather than being killed outright by germs at
   the end of the 1953 film, the aliens had all slipped into a state of
   suspended animation. Their bodies were stored away in toxic waste drums
   and shipped to various disposal sites within the United States (ten
   such sites are known to exist in the country), and a widespread
   government cover-up combined with a condition dubbed "selective
   amnesia" has convinced most people that the invasion had never
   happened.

   Although the original movie narration had explicitly stated that the
   aliens were Martians (even featuring artwork indicating an alien city
   on the planet Mars), since 1953 the concept of vastly intelligent life
   on Mars had lost plausibility. In the series, the aliens are revealed
   to actually be from Mor-Tax--a garden planet 40 light-years away in the
   Taurus constellation orbiting a dying sun.

   Thirty-five years later, in 1988 (modern day when the series began), a
   terrorist group calling itself the People's Liberation Party
   accidentally irradiates the drums containing the aliens while raiding
   the dumpsite near Fort Jericho. The radiation destroys the bacteria
   that were keeping the aliens unconscious. Once free, the aliens take
   possession of the bodies of the six terrorists who overran the site.
   From there they use a series of human bodies and crudely adapted Earth
   technology to find means of appropriating the planet, both in removing
   humanity and developing a permanent means to inoculate themselves
   against the planet's indigenous bacteria. Their attempt to successfully
   make Earth into their new homeworld is imperative for in roughly five
   years, three million colonists from Mor-Tax are expected to arrive.
