   World War III begins early in the 21st century. It is fought between
   the two superpowers, West-Dem and Pac-Peop. The fighting is extensive
   and severe, most of it performed by "leadies", robots built to
   withstand the most extreme circumstances. The Earth becomes a
   battlefield. Unable to exist in the atmosphere created by robot war,
   vast "ant tanks" are constructed underground to save the diminishing
   human population.

   The government and war engine remains on the surface; the elite
   "Yance-men". Their president, Talbot Yancy, delivers inspirational
   speeches to the tankers, motivating them to increase their production
   of leadies and win the war. The war does eventually end. However, the
   Yance-men design a conspiracy to maintain the wealth of the Earth for
   themselves. Yancy continues to describe devastation in televised
   speeches. The tankers continue to produce leadies.

   Talbot Yancy is actually a computer generated simulacrum. The Yance-men
   program him from the "Agency" in New York. They live in immense villas
   on private parks, called "demesnes". The leadies are actually used by
   the Yance-men as personal servants and to maintain their estates. The
   Agency is run by the most vicious and greedy Yance-man, Stanton Brose,
   who is kept alive by pre-war artificial organs which he hoards.

   The story begins in one of the tanks, named Tom Mix (named after the
   actor Tom Mix). The tank president, Nicholas St. James, is forced to go
   to the surface to buy an artificial pancreas on the black market. He
   emerges on David Lantano's property (a Yance-man). When some of
   Lantano's leadies try to kill St. James, they are destroyed by a
   mysterious man who looks like Talbot Yancy. St. James wanders around,
   through the ruins of a war, and eventually ends up at Lantano's
   mansion.

   Simultaneously, Joseph Adams (another Yance-man) is put on a special
   mission by Brose. He must plant evidence of alien artifacts on land
   belonging to a real-estate agent (Louis Runcible) so the land can be
   legitimately seized. The artifacts are buried using a time travel
   device. One by one, the people attached to this project are killed.
   Adams fearfully retreats to Lantano's mansion.

   Another person to appear in the mansion is Webster Foote, the owner and
   operator of a private detective corporation. Foote accepts work on a
   per-case basis from everybody (including Brose, Lantano and Runcible)
   but wishes to save Runcible from the plot against him.

   Lantano then reveals to Foote, Adams and St. James, that he is a
   Cherokee from the distant past, somehow being given extended life by
   the time travel device that placed the artifacts back in time. He has
   lived through history, taking many positions of note under different
   names, and now he has killed the members of this special project.
   Lantano, Foote, and Adams together now plot to kill Brose and free the
   people underground.

   However, Adams figures out Lantano was behind the deaths as part of his
   plot to bring down Brose. In desperation and fear, he joins up with St.
   James, who discovered a cache of artificial organs, and flees into the
   Tom Mix tank with him. They discover that Lantano was ultimately
   successful but contemplate that the biggest lie is yet to come.
