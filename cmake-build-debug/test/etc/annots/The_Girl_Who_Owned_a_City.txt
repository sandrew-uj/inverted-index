   A deadly virus has swept the world, killing off everyone over the age
   of twelve in the span of a month or so. In the town of Glen Ellyn,
   Illinois, outside of Chicago, ten-year-old Lisa Nelson and her younger
   brother Todd Nelson are surviving, like all the children in the story,
   by looting abandoned houses and shops. Although there are abandoned
   cars in every driveway and lining every street, Lisa is the first child
   to think of driving one. She is also the first to think of raiding a
   farm, and the first to look at the dwindling supplies in stores and
   deduce that groceries come from warehouses. She finds a supermarket
   warehouse and raids it, enlisting the help of Craig Bergman, a neighbor
   boy two years older than her, but makes clear to him and all the other
   children in her neighborhood that the entire warehouse and all its
   contents are her exclusive property, not to be shared unless she
   chooses: she assures them all that she will burn the warehouse and
   everything in it rather than be forced to share against her will.

   She considers relocating to the farm, but decides against it because it
   is difficult to defend (other children are starting to form gangs) and
   because "planning and getting the world back to the way it was, with
   schools, and hospitals, and electricity" are much more "exciting" than
   "hiding away on a farm ... digging in the dirt all day".

   Lisa and her friends are approached by the "Chidester Gang", led by Tom
   Logan. Suspecting that Lisa has a source of supplies, Logan offers a
   food-for-protection deal, which Lisa declines. Unhesitatingly taking
   charge, she forms her block-long stretch of Grand Avenue into a
   militia, armed with guns, Molotov cocktails, and primitive weapons.
   When the militia proves unsuccessful at defending the "Land of
   Grandville" against "the fearful and cruel army of Chidester and Elm",
   and Lisa's house is lost, Lisa comes up with the idea of moving the
   "child-families"--and the entire contents of the warehouse--into the
   local high school, and transforming it into a fortress-city. Within the
   city, Lisa is the only authority, by virtue of the fact that she saw
   the abandoned high school and thought of moving there: this has earned
   her sole title to the "City of Glenbard" and everything in it.

   A year after completion, things proceed according to plan until Logan
   and his gang manage to stage a successful attack on Glenbard, during
   which Lisa is shot in the arm. Todd and Lisa's friend Jill rescue her,
   and Jill performs basic surgery to remove the bullet from her arm,
   dosing her with whiskey for pain relief. When Lisa recovers, they
   retake the city from Logan, who has meanwhile learned that conqueror
   and leader are two very different things. Glenbard's "citizens" have
   shown no sign of rebellion, or of preferring Lisa's leadership to
   Logan's (or vice versa), but Lisa lectures him into relinquishing
   control of the city to her.

   The book ends with a foreshadowing that the citizens of Glenbard will
   at some time be forced to face far larger armies, led by now extremely
   powerful dictators, tyrants and warlords. If any semblance of a free
   society is to exist in the new world, the citizens of Glenbard must
   make themselves capable of protecting and growing it by gaining in
   knowledge, power, and organization, and at the same time continuing to
   incorporate leadership and respect for the individual person into their
   society.
