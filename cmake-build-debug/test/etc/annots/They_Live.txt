   A homeless drifter, credited only as "Nada" ("nothing") comes to Los
   Angeles in search of a job. While out on the street, he sees a street
   preacher warning that "they" have recruited the rich and powerful to
   control humanity. Nada finds employment at a construction site and
   befriends fellow construction worker Frank, who invites him to live in
   a shanty town soup kitchen led by a man named Gilbert.

   That night, a hacker takes over television broadcasts, claiming that
   scientists had discovered signals that were enslaving the population
   and keeping them in a dream-like state, and that the only way to stop
   it is to shut off the signal at its source. Those watching the
   broadcast complain of headaches. Nada secretly follows Gilbert and the
   street preacher into a nearby church, and discovers them meeting with a
   group that includes the hacker. He sees scientific equipment and
   cardboard boxes inside, and hears Gilbert worrying that the Hoffman
   lenses they made won't be enough without "strong people" to help them.
   Nada is discovered by the blind preacher and escapes.

   That night, the shantytown and church are destroyed in a police raid,
   and the hacker and preacher are beaten by riot police. The following
   day, Nada retrieves one of the boxes from the church and takes a pair
   of sunglasses from it, hiding the rest in a trash can. Nada discovers
   that the sunglasses make the world appear black and white, but also
   reveal subliminal messages in the media to consume, reproduce, and
   conform. The glasses also reveal that many people are actually aliens
   with skull-like faces.

   When Nada mocks an alien woman at a supermarket, she alerts other
   aliens via a wristwatch-like device. Nada leaves, but is confronted by
   two alien cops. He kills them and steals their weapons. Nada enters a
   bank, where he sees that several of the employees and customers are
   aliens. After taunting them by saying, "I have come here to chew bubble
   gum, and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubble gum", he kills several
   aliens with a shotgun and escapes by taking Cable 54 employee Holly
   Thompson hostage. At Holly's home, Nada tries to get her to try on the
   glasses, but she knocks him out of the window and down a hill, and then
   calls the police.

   The next day, Nada returns to the alleyway and retrieves the box of
   sunglasses from a garbage truck before Frank meets Nada to give him his
   paycheck. Nada tries to get Frank to put on a pair of the glasses, but
   Frank thinks Nada is a murderer and wants nothing to do with him to
   protect his family. Frank and Nada get into a long and violent brawl,
   after which Frank is too tired to prevent Nada from putting the
   sunglasses on him. After seeing the aliens and a flying saucer, Frank
   agrees to go into hiding with Nada.

   Frank and Nada find Gilbert, who leads them to a meeting of the
   anti-alien movement. At the meeting, they are given contact lenses to
   replace the sunglasses, and learn that the aliens are using global
   warming to make Earth more like their own planet, and are depleting the
   Earth's resources for their own gain. They also learn that the aliens
   have been bribing humans to become collaborators, promoting them into
   positions of power. Holly arrives at the meeting, apologizing to Nada,
   with information on the source of the signal. However, the meeting is
   raided by police and the vast majority of those present are killed,
   with the survivors (including Frank, Nada, and Holly) scattering into
   the night as the police surround the area. Nada and Frank are cornered
   by police in an alley, but they accidentally activate an alien
   wristwatch, opening a portal through which they escape.

   The portal takes them to the aliens' spaceport, where they discover a
   meeting of aliens and human collaborators, celebrating the elimination
   of the "terrorists". They are approached by a former drifter they
   briefly met in the shanty town, now a collaborator, who gives them a
   tour of the facility. He leads them to the basement of Cable 54, the
   source of the signal, which is protected by armed guards. Nada and
   Frank find Holly and fight their way to the transmitter on the roof,
   but Holly suddenly kills Frank, revealing that she too is a human
   collaborator. Nada kills Holly and destroys the transmitter, but is
   fatally wounded by aliens in a helicopter. Nada gives the aliens the
   middle finger as he dies.

   With the transmitter destroyed, humans all over the world discover the
   aliens hiding among them: in the final scene, a woman realizes that the
   man with whom she is having sex is in fact one of the aliens.
