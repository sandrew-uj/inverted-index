   The Survivors live deep underground in a world of complete darkness,
   divided into two clans, one living in the Lower Level and one in the
   Upper Level. Their legends tell of the Original World where man lived
   alongside the Light Almighty (a concept of which they can no longer
   conceive) and away from the ultimate evil, Radiation, with its two
   Lieutenants the Twin Devils Cobalt and Strontium. The Lower Level
   Survivors venerate a relic known as the Holy Bulb. "So compassionate
   was the Almighty (it was the Guardian of the Way's voice that came back
    now) that when He banished man from Paradise, He sent parts
   of Himself to be with us for a while. And He dwelled in many little
   vessels like this Holy Bulb."

   Jared is the son of the Prime Survivor, the leader of the Lower Level
   clan. He is himself due to become a Survivor (i.e. an adult clansman),
   but Jared is too busy with his quest to find Light. He rationalizes
   that to find distant Light he must first locate its opposite, Darkness,
   which is near and "abounds in the worlds of men!" He goes on to
   theorize that:

   "Darkness must be something real. Only, we can't recognize it."

   ...

   "There's a clue . We know that in the Original World - the
   first world that man inhabited after he left Paradise - we were closer
   to Light Almighty. In other words, it was a good world. Now let's
   suppose there's some sort of connection between sin and evil and this
   Darkness stuff. That means there must be less Darkness in the Original
   World, Right?"

   ...

   "Then all I have to do is find something there's less of in the
   Original World ."

   ...

   "If Darkness is connected with evil and if Light is its opposite, then
   Light must be good. And if I find Darkness, then I may have some kind
   of idea as to the nature of Light."

   By leaving the safety of the central echo-caster, with only a pair of
   click stones with which to listen, Jared exposes himself to soubat
   (once common cave bats that either "Cobalt or Strontium took ... down
   to Radiation and made  over into ... super-creature") and
   Zivvers (people with an apparently unfathomable ability to navigate
   despite having poor hearing compared to the Survivors; it turns out
   that Zivvers navigate in darkness using infrared, while Survivors use
   echolocation). The soubats and Zivvers are thought of as similar, or
   even related, by the Survivors because of their similar abilities. "It
   was an uncanny ability nobody could explain, except to say [soubats and
   Zivvers] were possessed of Cobalt or Strontium."

   Jared's quest for Light is interrupted by unexplained disappearances
   and an arranged marriage to Della, a girl from the Upper Level, the
   daughter of their chief 'the Wheel'. Things get progressively worse as
   strange monsters roam the world and the hot springs begin to dry up.
   Along with his betrothed, Jared sets out for the Zivver world, hoping
   it will bring him closer to Light, instead they find themselves fleeing
   from the monsters once again, and being pushed closer to the Original
   World.
