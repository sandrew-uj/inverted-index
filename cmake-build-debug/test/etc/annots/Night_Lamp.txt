   When the Faths, a childless academic couple, save young Jaro from a
   near-fatal beating, they discover he suffers from not just physical
   wounds, but also the crippling memory of his mother's death, which must
   be erased. Adopted by them, he grows up an outsider in a world of
   constant striving for social status, his only goal to become a spaceman
   and discover the truth of his missing memories. His journey takes him
   to Fader, a planet closed to the rest of the galaxy, whose inhabitants
   long ago engineered slave races to support their aristocratic
   lifestyle. Though Fader's Golden Age has long passed, and they now live
   in fear of many of their creations, they still maintain a fierce pride.
   Together with his father, Jaro must find a way to bring justice for his
   mother.
