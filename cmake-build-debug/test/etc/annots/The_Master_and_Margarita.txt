   The novel has two settings. The first is Moscow during the 1930s, where
   Satan appears at Patriarch's Ponds as Professor Woland. He is
   accompanied by Koroviev, a grotesquely dressed valet; Behemoth, a black
   cat; Azazello, a hitman; and Hella, a female vampire. They target the
   literary elite and Massolit, their trade union,^[note 1] whose
   headquarters is Griboyedov House. Massolit consists of corrupt social
   climbers and their women, bureaucrats, profiteers, and cynics. The
   second setting is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate: Pilate's trial of
   Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus of Nazareth), his recognition of an affinity
   with (and spiritual need for) Yeshua, and his reluctant acquiescence to
   Yeshua's execution.

   Part one opens with a confrontation between Berlioz (the head of
   Massolit) and Woland, who prophesies that Berlioz will die later that
   evening. Although Berlioz dismisses the prophecy as insane raving, he
   dies as the professor predicted. His death prophecy is witnessed by
   Ivan Nikolaevich Ponyrev, a young, enthusiastic, modern poet who uses
   the pen name Bezdomny ("homeless"). His nom de plume alludes to Maxim
   Gorky (Maxim the Bitter), Demyan Bedny (Demyan the Poor), and Michail
   Golodny (Michail the Hungry). His futile attempts to capture the "gang"
   (Woland and his entourage) and his warnings about their evil nature
   land Ivan in a lunatic asylum, where he is introduced to the Master, an
   embittered author. The rejection of his novel about Pontius Pilate and
   Christ led the Master to burn his manuscript in despair and turn his
   back on Margarita, his devoted lover.

   The novel's first part includes satirical depictions of Massolit and
   Griboyedov House; Satan's magic show at a variety theatre, satirizing
   the vanity, greed, and gullibility of the new elite; and Woland and his
   retinue appropriating Berlioz's apartment after his death.
   (Apartments - scarce in Moscow - were controlled by the state, and
   Bulgakov based the novel's apartment on his own.)

   Part two introduces Margarita, the Master's mistress, who refuses to
   despair of her lover and his work. Azazello gives her a magical skin
   ointment and invites her to the Devil's midnight Good Friday ball,
   where Woland gives her the chance to become a witch.

   Margarita enters the realm of night and learns to fly and control her
   unleashed passions. Natasha, her maid, accompanies her as they fly over
   the Soviet Union's deep forests and rivers. Margarita bathes and
   returns to Moscow with Azazello as the hostess of Satan's spring ball.
   At Azazello's side, she welcomes dark historical figures as they arrive
   from Hell.

   Margarita survives the ordeal, and Satan offers to grant her deepest
   wish and she asks for another person, she asks to free a woman she met
   at the ball from eternal punishment. The woman, who had been raped,
   murdered the child; her punishment was to wake each morning next to the
   handkerchief she used to smother it. Satan tells Margarita that she
   liberated the woman, and still has a wish to claim from him. She asks
   for the Master to be delivered to her and he appears, dazed and
   thinking he is still in the lunatic asylum. They are returned to the
   basement apartment which had been their love nest.

   Matthew Levi delivers the verdict to Woland: the reunited couple will
   be sent to the afterlife. Azazello brings them a gift from Woland: a
   bottle of Pontius Pilate's (poisoned) wine. The Master and Margarita
   die; Azazello brings their souls to Satan and his retinue (awaiting
   them on horseback on a Moscow rooftop), and they fly away into the
   unknown, as cupolas and windows burn in the setting sun, leaving Earth
   behind and traveling into dark cosmic space. The Master and Margarita
   will spend eternity together in a shady, pleasant region resembling
   Dante Alighieri's Limbo, in a house under flowering cherry trees.

   Woland and his retinue, including the Master and Margarita, become pure
   spirits. Moscow's authorities attribute its strange events to hysteria
   and mass hypnosis. In the final chapter, Woland tells the Master to
   finish his novel about Pontius Pilate - condemned by cowardice to limbo
   for eternity. The Master shouts "You are free! He is waiting for you!";
   Pontius Pilate is freed, walking and talking with the Yeshua whose
   spirit and philosophy he had secretly admired. Moscow is now peaceful,
   although some experience great disquiet every May full moon. Ivan
   Ponyrev becomes a professor of philosophy, but he does not write poetry
   anymore.
