   The plot is set within the framework of a Cold War scenario very
   similar to the geopolitical situation at the time of writing. It is
   told from the perspective of Roland, a 12-year-old boy from Bonames (a
   district of Frankfurt), who travels with his parents and sisters to
   visit his grandparents in Schewenborn.

   During their journey, they are surprised by a nuclear attack. As
   emergency response systems fail to activate and no humanitarian aid
   reaches them, the survivors have to assume that the whole of Germany,
   or even the entire civilized world, may have been destroyed. The
   question of whether this is actually the truth is only resolved by the
   end of the novel.

   The family finds refuge in the house of the grandparents, who were in
   Fulda at the time of the nuclear explosion and presumably died there.
   Shortly afterwards, Roland's mother takes in a young brother and sister
   who had been made orphans by the bombs.

   The later chapters of the story describe the weeks, months and years
   after the nuclear attack, and are almost exclusively set in
   Schewenborn.

   The Last Children of Schewenborn does not have a happy ending. One by
   one, members of Roland's family, including a new-born sibling without
   eyes, die of radiation sickness and other illnesses. By the end of the
   book, only Roland, his father, and a small group of boys and girls
   representing the titular last children remain alive, and the final
   paragraphs suggest that they, too, will perish.
