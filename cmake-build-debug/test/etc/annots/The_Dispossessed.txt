   The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia is a 1974 utopian science fiction
   novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, set in the fictional
   universe of the seven novels of the Hainish Cycle, e.g. The Left Hand
   of Darkness. The book won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1974,^[1]
   as well as winning both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1975,^[2] and
   received a nomination for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in
   1975.^[2] It achieved a degree of literary recognition unusual for
   science fiction due to its exploration of themes such as anarchism (on
   a satellite planet called Anarres) and revolutionary societies,
   capitalism, and individualism and collectivism.

   It features the development of the mathematical theory underlying a
   fictional ansible, an instantaneous communications device that plays a
   critical role in Le Guin's novels in the Hainish Cycle. The invention
   of an ansible places the novel first in the internal chronology of the
   Hainish Cycle, although it was the fifth published.^[3]
