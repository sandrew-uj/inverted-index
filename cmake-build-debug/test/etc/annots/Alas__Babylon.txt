   The story is set in a fictional 1959, following two years of escalating
   tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union for dominance
   in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean Sea. The Soviets are
   menacing Turkey from three sides through their proxies in Egypt, Syria
   and Iraq in order to gain control of the Bosporus and give free passage
   to their large Mediterranean fleet. To counteract the Soviet menace the
   United States established a military presence in Lebanon and are
   providing aid to their Turkish and Israeli allies.

   As detailed in the book, the Soviets gained a temporary space supremacy
   through the launch of a massive fleet of militarized Sputniks;
   moreover, they are aware that, within three or four years, the United
   States will cover the gap. Intelligence from a Soviet officer who
   defected in Berlin provided information about a Soviet war plan
   involving a sudden, overwhelming nuclear first strike on U.S. and NATO
   military and civilian targets, in order to minimize retaliation and
   become the leading world power. According to the leaked war plan the
   Soviet leadership considers acceptable the loss of 20 to 30 million of
   their own civilian population due to the retaliatory strike by NATO.

   Narration follows the point of view of Randy Bragg, who lives an
   aimless life in the small Central Florida town of Fort Repose. His
   older brother, Colonel Mark Bragg, an Air Force Intelligence officer,
   sends a telegram ending in the words, "Alas, Babylon", a
   pre-established code between the brothers to warn of imminent disaster.
   Mark flies his family down to Fort Repose for their protection while he
   stays at Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in
   Omaha, Nebraska.

   Soon afterward, a U.S. fighter pilot, attempting to intercept an enemy
   plane over the Mediterranean, inadvertently destroys an ammunition
   depot in a large Soviet submarine base in Latakia, Syria. The explosion
   is mistaken for a large-scale U.S. air assault on the military facility
   and, by the following day, the Soviet Union retaliates with its planned
   full-scale nuclear strike against the United States and its allies.
   With Mark as a witness, U.S. missiles are sent in retaliation. Randy
   and his guests awake to the shaking from the bombing of nearby military
   bases; one explosion temporarily blinds Peyton, Randy's niece.

   Fort Repose descends into chaos: tourists are trapped in their hotels,
   communication lines fail, the CONELRAD radio system barely operates,
   convicts escape from prisons and a run on the banks makes currency
   worthless.

   In the weeks and months after the attack sporadic news gathered through
   an old but still-functioning vacuum tube radio receiver show that many
   major cities of the U.S. are in ruins and vast regions of the
   Continental United States are labeled by the government as off-limits,
   "contaminated zones". The whole of Florida is among the contaminated
   areas, leaving the stranded survivors of Fort Repose without hope of
   immediate assistance. Most of the government has been eliminated, with
   the U.S. presidency defaulting to Josephine Vanbruuker-Brown, the
   former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Other international
   broadcasts reveal that Western Europe was badly hit by Soviet missiles
   as well (a dire situation in southern France is mentioned). Soviet
   leadership was eliminated by U.S. retaliation and the capital of the
   Soviet Union was moved to Central Asia, but war still rages for months
   after the attack, although it is fought mostly between the remnants of
   U.S. Air Force and scattered Soviet Navy nuclear submarines.

   Since Randy was an Army Reserve officer before the Soviet attack, a
   radio dispatch by President Vanbruuker-Brown formally empowers him as
   the local authority under the current emergency situation. Randy then
   organizes a community self-defence team against bandits and tries to
   rid the community of radioactive jewellery taken into Fort Repose from
   the radioactive ruins of Miami. The search for alternative food sources
   is also prominent in the months following the attack, leading to the
   launch of a rag-tag fleet of fishing boats to sift the surrounding
   swamps for fish and to a desperate search for the much-needed salt.

   The following year, an Air Force helicopter arrives at Fort Repose. The
   crew assess the status of the residents and the local environment,
   explaining that the area around Fort Repose is perhaps the largest
   patch of non-contaminated soil in the whole State of Florida and that,
   after all, the survivors of Fort Repose managed to fare better than
   many other places in the U.S. Randy also learns that his brother Mark
   has most likely died when Omaha and Offutt Base were destroyed by
   multiple hits. When the crew of the helicopter offer to evacuate the
   residents out of Florida, the residents choose to stay.

   It is finally revealed that the United States formally won the war, but
   at a tremendous cost: the country lost most of its population (45
   million survivors are estimated overall), its military, its
   infrastructure and most of its natural resources (ironically, the
   government is planning to use the large stockpiles of military-grade
   uranium and plutonium left from the war to power the surviving towns
   and cities). The U.S. is now receiving food, fuel and medicine aid from
   third-world countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Venezuela.
   Apparently, the "Three Greats" (deliberately left unclear but likely
   India, China and Japan) have taken the role of world leading powers in
   place of U.S. and Soviet Union.
