   Architect Guy Haines wants to divorce his unfaithful wife, Miriam, in
   order to marry the woman he loves, Anne Faulkner. While on a train to
   see his wife, he meets Charles Anthony Bruno, a psychopathic playboy
   who proposes an idea to "exchange murders": Bruno will kill Miriam if
   Guy kills Bruno's father; neither of them will have a motive, and the
   police will have no reason to suspect either of them. Guy does not take
   Bruno seriously, but Bruno kills Guy's wife while Guy is away in
   Mexico.

   Bruno informs Guy of his crime, but Guy hesitates to turn him in to the
   police. He realizes that Bruno could claim Guy's complicity in the
   planned exchange murders; however, the longer he remains silent, the
   more he implicates himself. This implicit guilt becomes stronger as in
   the coming months Bruno makes appearances demanding that Guy honor his
   part of the bargain. After Bruno starts writing anonymous letters to
   Guy's friends and colleagues, the pressure becomes too great, and Guy
   murders Bruno's father.

   Subsequently, Guy is consumed by guilt, whereas Bruno seeks Guy's
   company as if nothing had happened. He makes an uninvited appearance at
   Guy's wedding, causing a scene. At the same time, a private detective,
   who suspects Bruno of having arranged the murder of his father,
   establishes the connection between Bruno and Guy that began with the
   train ride, and suspects Bruno of Miriam's murder. Guy also becomes
   implicated due to his contradictions about the acquaintance with Bruno.

   When Bruno falls overboard during a sailing cruise, Guy identifies so
   strongly with Bruno that he tries to rescue him under threat to his own
   life. Nevertheless, Bruno drowns, and the murder investigation is
   closed. Guy, however, is plagued by guilt, and confesses the double
   murder to Miriam's former lover. This man, however, does not condemn
   Guy, and instead dismisses Miriam, as well as women in general, while
   enjoying Guy's liquor. The detective who had been investigating the
   murders overhears Guy's confession, however, and confronts him. Guy
   turns himself over to the detective immediately.
