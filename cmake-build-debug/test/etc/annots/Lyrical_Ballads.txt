   Wordsworth and Coleridge set out to overturn what they considered the
   priggish, learned, and highly sculpted forms of 18th-century English
   poetry and to make poetry accessible to the average person via verse
   written in common, everyday language. These two major poets emphasize
   the vitality of the living voice used by the poor to express their
   reality. This language also helps assert the universality of human
   emotions. Even the title of the collection recalls rustic forms of art
   - the word "lyrical" links the poems with the ancient rustic bards and
   lends an air of spontaneity, while "ballads" are an oral mode of
   storytelling used by the common people.

   In the 'Advertisement' included in the 1798 edition, Wordsworth
   explained his poetical concept:

     The majority of the following poems are to be considered as
     experiments. They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how
     far the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of
     society is adapted to the purpose of poetic pleasure.

   If the experiment with vernacular language was not enough of a
   departure from the norm, the focus on simple, uneducated country people
   as the subject of poetry was a signal shift to modern literature. One
   of the main themes of "Lyrical Ballads" is the return to the original
   state of nature, in which people led a purer and more innocent
   existence. Wordsworth subscribed to Rousseau's belief that humanity was
   essentially good but was corrupted by the influence of society. This
   may be linked with the sentiments spreading through Europe just prior
   to the French Revolution.
