   The series is set in a world divided into two major regions: the New
   World and the Old World. The New World consists of three lands with
   Westland in the west, D'Hara in the east, and the Midlands between
   them. D'Hara is ruled by a magically gifted member of the Rahl family,
   while the welfare of the Midlands is decided by a council of
   representatives led by the Mother Confessor, who is also the leader of
   the Confessors. The Confessors are a group of women who each have a
   magical power to force a person to become entirely devoted to them.
   People touched by a Confessor's power will do anything for her or
   truthfully answer any question she asks, hence the name Confessor.
   Westland, a land of no magic, is also ruled by a council of
   representatives. The Old World is not introduced until the second book
   in the series and its geographical features are described in less
   detail.

   The main character is a young man named Richard Cypher, a Westland
   woods guide whose simple life is forever changed after he becomes the
   Seeker of Truth, a champion of truth and justice. Over the course of
   the series, Richard learns about his heritage while seeking to stop the
   evil that others would unleash upon the world of the living. Because
   Richard refuses to sacrifice his values and lives his life as a free
   man, others begin to understand the nobility of man and what it means
   to be free. Each book is loosely themed around a Wizard's Rule, tenets
   by which all wizards should abide. The eleventh full-length novel,
   Confessor, concludes the series' central story arc regarding the
   invasion of the Imperial Order, an empire in the Old World led by
   Jagang. Warheart was the last novel in the series.
