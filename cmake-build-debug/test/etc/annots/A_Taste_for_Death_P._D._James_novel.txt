   In the dingy vestry of St. Matthew's Church, Paddington, two bodies
   have been found with their throats slashed. One is an alcoholic
   vagrant, whereas the other is Sir Paul Berowne, a baronet and recently
   resigned Minister of the Crown. Poet and Commander Adam Dalgliesh
   investigates one of the most convoluted cases of his career.
