   A year after the Toclafane attacked Earth and the Master took over the
   planet, humanity is on the verge of extinction. After her escape from
   the Valiant, Martha has been travelling around the world and avoiding
   detection. She has been preparing the surviving humans to concentrate
   their thoughts on the word "Doctor" the moment of the completion of the
   countdown to the launch of a fleet of rockets the Master is readying to
   wage war. The Tenth Doctor meanwhile has been spending a year
   psychically integrating himself into the Master's Archangel network of
   satellites, which channels the collective psychic energy of the people
   to the Doctor. Martha creates a cover story about finding four
   components to a gun the Master is vulnerable to as part of a plan to
   have Professor Docherty lead Martha back to the Master.

   Martha, together with Docherty and medic Thomas Milligan, capture a
   Toclafane. Upon examination they discover the Toclafane are humans who
   took the rocket to Utopia in the future. They cannibalised their bodies
   into metal spheres and their minds regressed into children. The Master
   created the Paradox Machine to allow them to return to the past and
   kill their ancestors while avoiding the grandfather paradox. Martha and
   Thomas leave to find the last component of the gun, and Docherty
   provides the Master with Martha's location in exchange for information
   on her own son.

   After cornering Martha, the Master destroys the gun and takes her back
   to the Valiant so he can kill her in front of the artificially aged
   Doctor. The collective psychic energy of the people thinking of the
   Doctor rejuvenates him, allowing him to overcome his captivity and
   force the Master to cower in defeat. Jack sets off to destroy the
   Paradox Machine. The destruction of the machine causes time to snap
   back right before the Toclafane appeared. The Doctor and his allies
   consider the Master's fate before the Master is shot by his wife Lucy.
   The Master, despite the Doctor urging him to regenerate, refuses and
   subsequently dies in the Doctor's arms. The Doctor, now the last of his
   species once more, cremates the Master's body on a funeral pyre.

   The Doctor returns Jack to Torchwood. Martha decides to leave the
   Doctor to care for her family, who can still remember their captivity
   on the Valiant. She gives him her mobile phone in case she needs to
   contact him. Afterwards, the bow of a ship called the Titanic bursts
   through a wall of the TARDIS control room.
