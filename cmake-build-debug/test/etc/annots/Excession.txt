   The Excession of the title is a perfect black-body sphere that appears
   mysteriously on the edge of Culture space, appearing to be older than
   the Universe itself and that resists the attempts of the Culture and
   technologically equivalent societies (notably the Zetetic Elench) to
   probe it. The Interesting Times Gang (ITG), an informal group of Minds
   loosely connected with Special Circumstances, try to manage the
   Culture's response to the Excession. The Affront, a rapidly expanding
   race which practises systematic sadism towards subject species and its
   own females and junior males, also try to exploit the Excession by
   infiltrating a store of mothballed Culture warships and using them to
   claim control of the mysterious object.

   The Sleeper Service, an Eccentric General Systems Vehicle (GSV) who had
   nominally left the Culture, is instructed to head to the location of
   the Excession by the ITG. As a condition the Sleeper Service demands
   that Genar-Hofoen, a human member of Contact, attend it to seek a
   resolution with his ex-lover who lives in solitude on the GSV. They had
   had an intense love-affair and, after a series of sex changes, had each
   become impregnated by the other until Genar-Hofoen was unfaithful and
   Dajeil attacked Genar-Hofoen, killing the unborn child. Dajeil then
   suspended her pregnancy and withdrew from society for 40 years and the
   Sleeper Service hopes to effect a reconciliation between them.

   As the stolen Affront fleet approaches the Excession, the Sleeper
   Service deploys a fleet of 80,000 remote controlled warships, in a
   misguided attempt to neutralize the threat. It transpires that the
   Affront have been manipulated into their grab for power by members of
   the ITG who thought it was morally imperative to curb the Affront's
   cruelty by any means, and intend to use the Affront's theft of Culture
   warships as an excuse for war. The Excession releases a wave of
   destructive energy towards the Sleeper Service. In desperation, the
   Sleeper Service transmits a complete copy of its personality, its
   "Mindstate", into the Excession, which has the effect of halting the
   attack. The Excession then vanishes as mysteriously as it appeared and
   the brief war with the Affront is halted.

   During these events, and after speaking with Genar-Hofoen, Dajeil
   decides to complete her pregnancy and remain on the Sleeper Service,
   which sets course for a satellite galaxy. Genar-Hofoen returns to the
   Affront, having been rewarded by being physically transformed into a
   member of the Affront species (whose company he finds more stimulating
   than that of the Culture's people).

   The book's epilogue reveals that the Excession is a sentient entity
   that was acting as a bridge for a procession of beings that travel
   between universes. It also assesses whether the species and societies
   it encounters are suitable to be enlightened about some unknown further
   existence beyond the universe; as a result of events in the story the
   Excession concludes that the civilisations it has encountered in this
   universe are not yet ready. It also takes the name given to it by the
   Culture - The Excession - as its own - in an oblique reference to the
   aforementioned Affront species, who had been named by another species
   in an attempt to label them as a lost cause of hyper-sadistic freaks.
