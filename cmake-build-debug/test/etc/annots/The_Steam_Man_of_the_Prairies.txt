   The first novel starts when Ethan Hopkins and Mickey McSquizzle--a
   "Yankee" and an "Irishman"--encounter a colossal, steam-powered man in
   the American prairies. This steam-man was constructed by Johnny
   Brainerd, a teenaged boy, who uses the steam-man to carry him in a
   carriage on various adventures.

   The steam-powered man also appears in several panels of both The League
   of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Nemo: Heart of Ice. He is also
   referenced in Planetary.
