   Page 5 - Introduction: Cox imparts that lumberjack yarns were carried
   from camp to camp. Also that while much has been written concerning
   lumberjacks, little has been put down concerning the creatures of his
   imagination.

   Page 9 - The Hugag: A large, herbivorous mammal of the northern woods
   having jointless legs that prevents it from lying down.

   Page 11 - The Gumberoo: A nearly hairless, bear-like brute of the
   Pacific coast. The creature is purported to have a rubbery hide that
   bounces back anything thrown on it. Bullets will rebound in the
   direction they were fired. They can be killed when forest fires cause
   them to explode, leaving behind a rubbery smell.

   Page 13 - The Roperite: A flightless bird of the Sierra Nevadas, that
   ropes in its prey with a lasso-like beak.

   Page 15 - The Snoligoster: An enormous crocodilian monster of the
   southern cypress swamps. Being absent of any limbs the creature drives
   itself through the marsh aided by its propeller tipped tail. The
   snoligoster was spared from gun fire by a certain Inman F. Eldredge
   after it impaled a fugitive he had been tracking.

   casket-shaped structure that, after wandering down from the mountains,
   explodes upon contact with the searing sands of the desert.

   Page 21 - The Slide-Rock Bolter: An appendageless leviathan, save for
   two claw-like hooks, that grapples itself atop Colorado slopes awaiting
   anything at the bottom, where after the hungry creature skids down the
   incline with its jaws wide open. After the consumption of its prey, the
   momentum it gained while traveling down the slope will carry it to a
   new one.

   Page 23 - The Toteroad Shagamaw: A northeastern, bipedal beast with
   both hooves and paws that causes much confusion by swapping the two.
   While traveling it leaves behind tracks that abruptly switch from a
   moose, to a bear, and vice versa.

   Page 25 - The Wapaloosie: A petite varmint of the northwest
   distinguished by its ability to scale substantial heights; an ability
   it retains even after being made into a pair of mittens.

   Page 27 - The Cactus cat: A southwestern feline having a coat
   resembling thorns and a tail like branches; notorious for its fondness
   for fermented cactus juice (which it greedily gulps down.) The cat then
   becomes intoxicated and goes shrieking into the night.

   Page 29 - The Hodag: A large animal ranging from Wisconsin to Minnesota
   having a spade-shaped bony growth at end of its nose. It uses this
   growth to level trees containing its natural prey, porcupine.

   Page 31 - The Squonk: A creature of the Pennsylvanian hemlock forests
   so ashamed of its upsetting countenance that it weeps constantly. J. P.
   Wentling once managed to catch one in a sack, but as he began to walk
   away he felt his load lighten. He opened the sack to find the squonk
   had dissolved completely into tears.

   Page 33 - The Whirling Whimpus: A fiend of the Cumberland Mountains
   that spins so rapidly it becomes undetectable save for a buzzing sound.
   In this manner it awaits a victim. When the two come into contact, its
   prey instantly becomes a syrup which the whimpus feeds upon.

   Page 35 - The Agropelter: A creature of the Northwoods resentful of the
   intrusion of the lumberjack. The agropelter hurls branches at passersby
   striking them unconscious or resulting in death. A Big Ole Kittleson
   who was struck by the Agropelter, but hit by a rotted limb was able to
   catch a glimpse of the creature, which he reported as having an
   ape-like countenance and arms like "muscular whiplashes."

   Page 37 - The Splinter Cat: A feline, who during thunderstorms, uses
   its rigid forehead to ram trees. These trees contain its primary
   sources of food (raccoons and honey).

   Page 39 - The Snow Wasset: Awaiting its prey to cross along the snowy
   surface of the Boreal Zone. Just underneath the legless beast burrows,
   springs out from under, then pulls its victim in. It has been known to
   shed its legs while burrowing.

   legs, so to always land feet first.

   Page 43 - Billdad: A varmint of Boundary pond, Maine noted for it

   lake.

   Page 45 - Tripodero: A Californian beast native to the foothill forest.
   Its most prominent features are its extendable, tripod-like legs and
   blow gun like mouth. The latter it fills with balls of clay it uses to
   shoot out its game.

   Page 47 - Hyampom Hog Bear: A bear with a voracious appetite for pork.
   At times taking whole chunks out of them while they squeal in pain.
   Eugene S. Bruce, of the Forest Service, captured one and took it to the
   National Zoo in Washington D.C..
