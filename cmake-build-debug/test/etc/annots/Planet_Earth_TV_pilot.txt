   It is the year 2133, and Earth was devastated by a nuclear war decades
   earlier. A team from PAX is conducting a survey of central California.
   PAX is a science-based society dedicated to restoring civilization and
   peace to the world.

   Returning to PAX headquarters, the team is attacked by a group of
   militaristic mutants known as the Kreeg. After a struggle, the PAX team
   manages to escape in a hyperloop subsurface shuttle, a vehicle that can
   travel between settlements via tubes, built during the early 1990s
   before the final conflict of the 20th century. One of the team, Pater
   Kimbridge (Rai Tasco), is severely wounded. To save his life he
   requires a bioplastic prosthesis to repair the damaged pulmonary artery
   sheared away by a Kreeg rifle shot.

   PAX Team 21, led by Dylan Hunt (John Saxon), with members Baylok
   (Christopher Cary), Isiah (Ted Cassidy reprising his role from Genesis
   II), and Harper-Smythe (Janet Margolin) tries to locate a missing
   doctor, Jonathan Connor (Jim Antonio), the only surgeon who can perform
   the delicate surgery in time. Their search leads the team to the
   Confederacy of Ruth, a society of latter-day Amazons, where women are
   dominant and men are enslaved.

   As a ruse, Harper-Smythe binds Hunt and enters the Confederacy's
   territory with him as her "property". Once there, she meets Marg (Diana
   Muldaur), the leader of the women, who claims Dylan as her own
   property. Harper-Smythe makes her way to a nearby farm and meets a
   woman who explains how the society operates (and how there are fewer
   and fewer children).

   While captive, Hunt learns that the men (referred to as "Dinks") are
   subjugated by a drug in their food. Despite his efforts, he soon
   succumbs to the effects of the drug. Harper-Smythe arrives at the
   village in time to reclaim her "property" by challenging and defeating
   Marg. When Harper-Smythe is unable to find Connor in the village, Marg
   invites her to see Marg's newcomer Dinks. Connor comes forward with an
   antidote for the drug and Hunt recovers. Connor, Hunt and Harper-Smythe
   decide that she should swap Hunt for Connor, allowing the doctor to
   return to PAX. Marg agrees to the exchange and Connor and Harper-Smythe
   leave for PAX after first distributing the antidote in the Dink food
   supply. That evening, free of the influence of the drug, Hunt seduces
   Marg.

   In the morning, a small party of Kreeg arrive and demand the secret to
   making men compliant. Hunt leads the un-drugged men in overpowering the
   invaders. They learn the men in the other households were equally
   successful in fending off the Kreeg. As a result, the women's council
   decides to suspend the drug treatment program on their males. Kimbridge
   soon recovers from the operation.
