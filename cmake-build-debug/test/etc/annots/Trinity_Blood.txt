   When Earth's population drastically increased, humanity, led by the
   United Nations, attempted to colonize Mars. During the colonization,
   they discovered two alien technologies: the Bacillus virus and the
   Crusnik nanomachines. The colonists injected the Bacillus in their
   bodies which transformed them into a vampiric race known as
   "Methuselah". They installed the Crusnik in the bodies of four test
   tube babies: Seth, Cain, Abel and Lilith whose enhanced bodies were the
   only ones able to survive the procedure.

   Continuing wars on Earth eventually led to Armageddon, the apocalyptic
   event that happened 900 years before the start of the story, and the
   colonists returned to Earth to help with rebuilding. However, when the
   colonists returned to Earth, a war broke out between the Methuselah and
   the humans who had remained on Earth. Abel, Cain, and
   Seth sided with the Methuselah--while Lilith supported the Vatican,
   which guarded humanity. During the war, Cain went insane and killed
   Lilith. In grief, Abel took her body to the Vatican where she was
   buried. Abel remained at her side, weeping for her, for 900 years.

   At the start of the story, the Methuselah, still a major political and
   military force, continue to wage war on the "Terrans", as they call the
   human inhabitants of Earth. The Roman Catholic Church is a major
   military power determined to protect humans from the Methuselah, with
   its seat of power based in the Vatican. The Methuselah have their
   capital in Byzantium, which is surrounded by a field of particles to
   filter out UV radiation, protecting the Methuselah population.

   Both groups use "lost technologies", such as airships, missiles, and
   computers, to engage in a cold war with one another. A third great
   power, Albion also plays a role in the war with its superior arsenal of
   lost technology and weapons and higher level of manufacturing ability
   versus the Vatican. The independent monarchy of Albion is a primarily
   human country, however the secret of their expertise in lost technology
   is found in the Ghetto, an underground city of enslaved Methuselah. It
   is these Methuselah who operate and manufacture the lost technology,
   but with the death of the Albion Queen, some of the enslaved vampires
   begin a rebellion for the freedom of all of the Ghetto residents.
