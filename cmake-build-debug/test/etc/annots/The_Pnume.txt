   After many false starts and real tribulations, Adam Reith has nearly
   finished building a spaceship to take him home. He and his two trusted
   companions had been betrayed by Aila Woudiver, the underworld kingpin
   who had provided the necessary men and equipment in return for an
   extortionate amount of money. However, Reith was able to turn the
   tables and take Woudiver captive (as described in The Dirdir).

   Even as a prisoner though, Woudiver is a dangerous enemy. Somehow, he
   manages to interest the Pnume in Reith. The Pnume are the sentient
   native race of Tschai. Driven underground by three separate alien
   invasions (by the Chasch, Wankh and Dirdir), they view the other
   species as welcome additions to the pageantry unfolding on their world
   stage. In the same light, they are intrigued by the Earthman, abducting
   him to become a specimen in their museum.

   Reith is lowered into the vast Pnume underground. He manages to free
   himself and hide before he can be taken by human Pnumekin, servants of
   the Pnume, to the Museum of Foreverness. Perplexed at finding an empty
   bag, they summon a Pnume Sector Warden, who consults its Master Charts,
   detailing all the various tunnels and hidden adits. Determining that
   there is one possible escape route, they leave to check it. Before it
   departs, the Sector Warden hides its maps in a secret compartment, but
   Reith is a witness. He steals them, but is unable to decipher their
   contents.

   He kidnaps a young Pnumekin woman to interpret for him. Once Reith
   forces her to look at the Master Charts, she realizes her life is now
   forfeit if she is captured, so she cooperates. Upon questioning, Reith
   learns that she has no name; she simply belongs to the Zith group in
   the Athan area of the Pagaz zone, with a rank of 210, so he names her
   Zap 210.

   After a journey of indeterminate length, mostly spent on a barge, they
   finally escape to the surface. They make their way toward the city of
   Sivishe, where the spaceship is being built. As their trek continues,
   Zap 210's colorless personality begins to change, free of the peculiar
   constraints of Pnumekin society and the diko she had been fed to keep
   her body from developing normally. Eventually, she and Reith become
   lovers.

   When they reach the city, Reith finds Anacho waiting for him. He learns
   that, shortly after Reith's abduction, Woudiver had been taken to be
   prey for a Dirdir hunt. The ship had been seen, so Traz moved it to a
   location known only to Reith. However, when they prepare to leave, they
   find Zap 210 missing, captured by the Pnume.

   Despite Anacho's protestations, Reith gives himself up to the Pnume
   (after making certain preparations). He bargains with them, threatening
   to give copies of the Master Charts to the Dirdir unless they release
   Zap 210. He also demands that they free all the Pnumekin from their
   freakish existence. The Pnume have no choice; they agree to his terms.
   Reith and Zap 210 return to the surface, link up with Anacho and Traz,
   and finally depart for Earth.
