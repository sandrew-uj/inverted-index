   Appleseed takes place in the 22nd century, after the non-nuclear Third
   World War has led to the destruction of a majority of the Earth's
   people. While countries like Great Britain, USA and China have
   difficulty maintaining order and power, international organizations
   like the "Sacred Republic of Munma" and "Poseidon" have been
   established in the aftermath.

   The main characters are Deunan Knute and Briareos Hecatonchires, former
   SWAT members of the LAPD. They are found in the desolated city and
   invited to join the prestigious ESWAT (Extra Special Weapons And
   Tactics) organization in the utopian city of Olympus, the new world's
   most powerful state. Roughly one half of Olympus's population are
   bionically augmented.

   The series follows Deunan and Briareos as they protect their new home
   from both foreign and domestic threats to its security.
