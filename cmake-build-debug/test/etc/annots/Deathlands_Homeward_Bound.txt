   Earth is devastated by a nuclear war in 2084. The sky is red from
   chemical waste, and what was once the United States has become
   "Deathlands" inhabited by mutants. Communities ruled by powerful
   survivors are called "villes", and the one known as Front Royale had
   been ruled by a good man who is killed by his wife, Lady Rachel Cawdor
   (Traci Elizabeth Lords). His son, Harvey Cawdor (Alan C. Peterson),
   kills one of his brothers and partially blinds his young brother Ryan
   Cawdor (Vincent Spano), who then escapes.

   After spending 20 years in the wastelands, the one-eyed Ryan returns to
   Front Royale accompanied by his girlfriend, Krysty Wroth (Jenya Lano);
   the teenage mutant Jak Laurent (Nathan Carter); and weapons specialist
   J. B. Dix (Cliff Saunders) to face his stepmother and brother and
   avenge his father's murder.
