   After a brief framing scene among characters from The Rebel Angels, the
   novel turns to a conversation between the Recording Angel and the
   daimon in charge of Cornish's life. The main part of the book is that
   life as narrated by the Recording Angel, interspersed with comments in
   which the daimon explains how he worked to make Cornish a great man.

   We follow Cornish's life from his two Canadian grandparents - part of
   "what's bred in the bone" - through his childhood as a wealthy and
   precocious misfit in a small Ontario town, his education in Toronto and
   Oxford, his unusual apprenticeship as a restorer and painter in Nazi
   Germany, his wartime experiences in England, his postwar work with a
   group resembling the Monuments Men, and his collecting and patronage of
   the arts in Toronto. A repeated theme in his mature years is art
   forgery.

   Cornish's daimon believes that people develop through adversity and
   provides Cornish with plenty, most obviously at the hands of his
   childhood classmates and his artistic master in Germany, but also in
   two love affairs and in a friendship with a young man who in some ways
   is Cornish's apprentice. Another form of adversity is Cornish's
   situation as a talented artist whose interests and skills are out of
   fashion.

   First published by Macmillan of Canada in 1985, What's Bred in the Bone
   was on the short list for the 1986 Booker Prize.

   What's Bred in the Bone is the second novel of the Cornish Trilogy. It
   was followed by The Lyre of Orpheus. It is also connected to earlier
   novels; when Cornish is at school in Toronto, one of his teachers is
   Dunstan Ramsay from the Deptford Trilogy. There are many parallels to
   be found in W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage.
