   Libria, a totalitarian city-state established by survivors of World War
   III, blames human emotion as the cause for the war. Any activity or
   object that stimulates emotion is strictly forbidden. Those in
   violation are labelled "Sense Offenders" and sentenced to death. The
   population is forced to take a daily injection of "Prozium II" to
   suppress emotion. Libria is governed by the Tetragrammaton Council, led
   by "Father", who communicates propaganda through giant video screens
   throughout the city. At the pinnacle of law enforcement are the
   Grammaton Clerics, trained in the martial art of gun kata. Clerics
   frequently raid homes to search for and destroy illegal materials -
   art, literature and music - executing violators on the spot. A
   resistance movement, known as the "Underground", emerges to topple
   Father and the Tetragrammaton Council.

   In 2072, John Preston is a high-ranking Cleric whose wife, Viviana, was
   executed as a Sense Offender, leaving him as a single parent of two.
   Following a raid, Preston notices his partner, Errol Partridge, saves a
   book of poems by W. B. Yeats instead of turning it in for incineration.
   He follows Partridge to the Nether - a term for regions outside the
   city - and finds him reading the book. After seeing Preston, Partridge
   claims he gladly pays the heavy price of feeling emotion; Preston
   executes him as Partridge slowly reaches for his gun.

   Preston accidentally breaks a daily vial of Prozium and is unable to
   replace it before going on the next raid. Brief episodes of emotion set
   in evoking memories, stirring feelings, and making him more aware of
   his surroundings. He intentionally skips additional doses of Prozium,
   hiding them behind the mirror in his bathroom. Partridge is replaced
   with an ambitious, career-conscious Brandt, who expresses admiration
   for Preston's "uncompromising" work as a Cleric. On a raid, they arrest
   Sense Offender Mary O'Brien. To Brandt's surprise, Preston prevents him
   from executing O'Brien, saying she should be kept alive for
   interrogation. Brandt grows suspicious of Preston's hesitation.

   Preston begins to feel remorse for killing Partridge and develops an
   emotional relationship with O'Brien. He uncovers clues that lead to
   meeting Jurgen, leader of the Underground. Jurgen is planning to
   disrupt Prozium production to spark a populace uprising and convinces
   Preston that Father must be assassinated. Vice-Counsel DuPont meets
   with Preston to reveal that there is a traitor in the upper ranks of
   the Clerics. Although DuPont appears to know it is Preston, he assigns
   him the task of unmasking the traitor. Relieved, Preston accepts and
   promises to locate the Underground's leadership.

   Meanwhile, O'Brien is set to be executed, and Jurgen advises against
   interfering believing it could sabotage plans for the revolution.
   Unable to bear her death, Preston attempts to stop the execution and
   fails. He has an emotional breakdown and is arrested by Brandt, who
   brings him before DuPont. Preston tricks DuPont into believing that
   Brandt is the traitor. Following Brandt's arrest, Preston is told that
   his home will be searched as a formality. He rushes home to destroy the
   hidden vials only to discover his son, who stopped taking Prozium after
   his mother died, already has.

   Jurgen tells Preston to capture the leaders of the resistance to regain
   government trust, hoping it will get Preston close enough to
   assassinate Father. Preston is granted an exclusive audience with
   Father only to discover that Brandt was not arrested; it was part of a
   ruse to expose Preston and the Underground. DuPont reveals he is
   Father, having secretly replaced the original Father who died, and that
   he doesn't take Prozium to suppress emotion. He taunts Preston, asking
   how it felt to betray the Underground. Enraged, Preston fights his way
   through an army of bodyguards to DuPont's office, confronting and
   killing Brandt in a katana battle. DuPont and Preston engage in a gun
   kata showdown. Preston wins as DuPont pleads for his life asking, "Is
   it really worth the price?" Paying homage to Partridge's last words, he
   responds, "I pay it gladly" and kills DuPont. He destroys the command
   center that broadcasts Father propaganda. Preston watches with
   satisfaction from above as the Underground destroys Prozium
   manufacturing plants, signaling the beginning of the revolution.
