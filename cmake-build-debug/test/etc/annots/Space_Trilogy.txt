   The books in the trilogy are:
     * Out of the Silent Planet (1938), set mostly on Mars (Malacandra).
       In this book, Elwin Ransom voyages to Mars and discovers that Earth
       is exiled from the rest of the Solar System. Far back in Earth's
       past, it fell to an angelic being known as the Bent Oyarsa, and
       now, to prevent contamination of the rest of the Solar System ("The
       Field of Arbol"), it is known as "the silent planet" (Thulcandra).
     * Perelandra (1943), set mostly on Venus. Also known as Voyage to
       Venus. Here Dr Ransom journeys to an unspoiled Venus in which the
       first humanoids have just emerged.
     * That Hideous Strength (1945), set on Earth. A scientific think tank
       called the N.I.C.E. (The National Institute of Co-ordinated
       Experiments) is secretly in touch with demonic entities who plan to
       ravage and lay waste to planet Earth.

   In 1946, the publishing house Avon (now an imprint of HarperCollins)
   published a version of That Hideous Strength specially abridged by C.
   S. Lewis entitled The Tortured Planet.
