   By observing the lives of those around him and recording the goings-on,
   Gould set about compiling an exhaustive record of modern life he called
   the "Oral History." He claimed that oral history held more truth than
   the formalized history of textbooks and professors, as it gave voices
   to the lower classes that were representative of true humanity. In
   the 1920s, Gould had small portions of his "Oral History" published in
   magazines, but in the years that followed he became more secretive and
   eccentric. He was well-known among the local shopkeepers, artists, and
   restaurateurs, many of whom gave him handouts of money or food in
   support of his project.

   Mitchell met Gould in 1942 and wrote the profile "Professor Sea Gull"
   on him for The New Yorker. The first part of Joe Gould's Secret is made
   up of this profile, covering the period from Gould's graduation from
   Harvard University in 1911, leading up to the writing of his "Oral
   History", said to be composed of 20,000 conversations and 9,000,000
   words. The second part of the book is a more personal memoir of
   Mitchell's experiences with Gould, their eventual falling out, and his
   discovery of Joe Gould's secret: that the "Oral History" did not exist.

   Gould suffered from writer's block and hypergraphia; while to those
   around him he appeared to be taking constant notes--a notion he was
   happy to reinforce--he was, in fact, re-writing the same few chapters
   dealing with seemingly trivial events in his own early life. He had
   filled countless notebooks with edited versions of these events,
   evidently searching for meaning in the revisions. Out of respect,
   Mitchell waited several years after Gould's death to reveal the secret.
   He wrote the second article in 1964, and combined it with the original
   article in book form in 1965. Mitchell's pieces on Gould were later
   collected along with many of his other prominent works in the volume Up
   in the Old Hotel, published in 1992.
