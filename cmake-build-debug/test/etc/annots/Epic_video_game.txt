   The plot borrowed heavily from the television series Battlestar
   Galactica, Star Trek and the Star Wars film franchise, focusing on
   a fleet of ships carrying the human inhabitants of a planet threatened
   by an imminent supernova. The escape route leads through the Rexxon
   Empire's territory, however the Rexxons doubt the human's motives and
   refuse safe passage. With no other option, the humans are forced to
   attempt a crossing, leading to war between the two.

   As the game progresses, it becomes apparent to the Rexxon scientists
   monitoring the human's sun that the exodus is indeed genuine. However,
   the Rexxon military suppresses the knowledge and doubles down on their
   efforts to stop the human's fleet, deepening the conflict.

   The player controls the fleet's only hope, one of three experimental
   Epic class fighters. In the final mission, the fighter is also used to
   deploy a cobalt bomb.
