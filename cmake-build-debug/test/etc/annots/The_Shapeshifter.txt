   The Shapeshifter is a series of books by Ali Sparkes. The series
   follows the life of a boy named Dax Jones and is primarily set in
   England, firstly in the Cornwall area and later in the Lake District.
   During the first book, Finding the Fox, Dax discovers his ability to
   shapeshift into a fox, and is whisked away from his hated stepfamily by
   the government. Dax is one of a number of Colas (Children of Limitless
   Ability), young people who possess amazing supernatural powers. Some of
   his classmates are able to heal, move objects with their mind,
   communicate with the dead, or see into the future. These children
   attend a school called Tregarren College in Cornwall, which is later
   destroyed by a tidal wave, and the children move to Fenton Lodge, in
   the Lake District.
