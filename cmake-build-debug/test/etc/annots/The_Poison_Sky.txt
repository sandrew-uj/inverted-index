   400 million cars on Earth equipped with ATMOS devices are suffocating
   humanity with poisonous gas. Sylvia frees Wilfred from her car by
   breaking the windscreen. The Tenth Doctor tells Donna's family to get
   inside and seal the windows and doors as best they can. He and Donna
   return to the ATMOS factory, where the Doctor warns UNIT not to engage
   the Sontarans. The Doctor tells Donna to stay in the TARDIS for her own
   safety, but the Sontarans locate and teleport the TARDIS aboard their
   ship.

   When the Sontarans prevent UNIT from launching a nuclear missile at
   their ship with help from the clone of Martha, the Doctor works out
   that since their ship was safe, the Sontarans were really preventing
   the disruption of their atmospheric conversion. The Sontarans attack
   and take over the factory, easily overwhelming UNIT troops. UNIT
   manages a counterattack and calls in the aircraft carrier Valiant,
   which puts the Sontarans on the defensive. Following UNIT's offensive,
   the Doctor ventures into the factory and discovers the real Martha in
   one of the Sontarans' cloning devices. Having long suspected the truth,
   the Doctor awakens the real Martha, killing the clone in the process.
   Before dying, the clone reveals the gas is clone feed, which the Doctor
   deduces is used to breed billions of Sontaran soldiers on Earth. The
   Doctor tells Martha to keep UNIT from launching any missiles and rushes
   off.

   The Doctor, assisted by Donna, uses the teleport to return the TARDIS
   to Earth. They teleport with Martha to Rattigan's institution, finding
   him distraught over the potential disaster to Earth that he caused. The
   Doctor constructs his own atmospheric converter, which ignites the
   poison gas across the globe and allows the humans to breathe. The
   Doctor is aware the Sontarans will not concede defeat but feels that he
   needs to give them a chance to withdraw. He teleports to the Sontaran
   ship and offers Staal the chance to retreat, but Staal calls the
   Doctor's bluff and encourages him to destroy them. Humbled, Rattigan
   reactivates the teleport and switches places with the Doctor,
   sacrificing himself to activate the device and destroy the Sontarans.

   Afterward, Martha says goodbye to Donna and the Doctor inside the
   TARDIS and prepares to head home. Before she can leave however, the
   TARDIS doors suddenly snap shut and it dematerialises and heads to
   another destination.
