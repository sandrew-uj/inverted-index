   Sir Reginald Styles, a British diplomat trying to organise a peace
   conference to avert World War III, is in his study at Auderly House
   when a soldier wielding a futuristic looking pistol bursts in and holds
   him at gunpoint. However, before the guerrilla can fire, he vanishes,
   leaving Styles to shakily tell his secretary he has been visited by a
   ghost. As the conference is of vital international importance, UNIT is
   called in. The Chinese have pulled out of the conference and Styles
   will be flying to Peking to try to persuade them to rejoin. However,
   when the Third Doctor, Jo and the Brigadier go to Auderly House, Styles
   denies ever seeing the "ghost", even though the Doctor notes the
   presence of muddy footprints in the study.

   The guerrilla reappears on the grounds in a vortex-like effect, but is
   intercepted by two huge humanoid aliens, called Ogrons, who attack him
   and leave him for dead. UNIT soldiers discover the severely injured
   guerrilla and take him to hospital while the Doctor examines his weapon
   and a small black box that was found in a nearby tunnel system. Styles
   leaves for Peking, while the Doctor discovers that the pistol, an
   ultrasonic disintegrator, is made of Earth materials, not alien, and
   that the box is a crude time machine. As he tries to activate it, the
   vortex effect appears again and the guerrilla vanishes.. The Doctor and
   Jo spend the night at Auderly House to monitor any activity.

   The night passes without incident, but in the day, three guerrillas
   appear from the time vortex - Anat, a woman who is in command of the
   mission, and two men, Boaz and Shura. They come across a UNIT patrol
   and disintegrate the two soldiers while making their way to the house.
   In the study, the Doctor tries to reactivate the time machine, causing
   an alert to be sounded in the 22nd century. Shura enters, but the
   Doctor subdues him. Shura begs the Doctor to turn off the box, as in
   the future, a human Controller reports to the Daleks that the machine
   has been activated. The Daleks command that once the spacetime
   coordinates of the box are confirmed, whoever is using that device must
   be exterminated.

   In the present, Anat and Boaz enter with Jo as their prisoner and
   demand the machine be deactivated. The Doctor complies, and the
   conversation makes it apparent that the guerrillas believe he is
   Styles, whom they are apparently here to assassinate. The Doctor shows
   them a newspaper to convince them otherwise, and Anat demands to know
   who the Doctor is. When Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton enter to
   search for the missing patrol, the guerrillas usher the Doctor and Jo
   into the cellar where they are bound and gagged.

   In the future, the Daleks order the Controller to send troops to the
   frequency that they detected earlier, and activate a time vortex
   magnetron, so that anyone travelling between the two time zones will be
   drawn to the Controller's headquarters. In the past, Anat sends Shura
   to contact the future for more orders, but Shura only manages to
   retrieve a bomb from near the tunnel before being attacked by Ogrons.
   He is wounded but manages to stumble away.

   Jo and The Doctor ushered back up to the study after The Brigadier
   calls the house. The Doctor is forced to pretend over the telephone
   that everything is fine at Auderly House. The Brigadier tells the
   Doctor that Styles has convinced the Chinese to rejoin the conference
   and that the delegates will arrive the next day. The Brigadier asks for
   reassurance that everything is all right, and the Doctor tells him it
   is, but the Brigadier gets suspicious when the Doctor asks him to also
   "tell it to the Marines." The Brigadier decides to go to the house and
   see for himself. Jo frees herself from her bonds and threatens to
   destroy the box that the first guerrilla used, but Anat and Boaz tell
   her that it only worked for that person. Suddenly, Jo is taken into the
   future, appearing in the Controller's Headquarters.

   There, the Controller persuades Jo to tell him the exact time and
   location of where she came from. The Daleks use this information and
   send a Dalek supported by Ogrons to the present, where they attack the
   house. Anat and Boaz fire back and flee towards the tunnels. The
   Brigadier arrives just in time to gun down an Ogron, and the Doctor
   commandeers his jeep in pursuit of the two guerrillas. In the tunnels
   he finds Anat and Boaz just as they activate their time machines, and
   is swept up in the vortex. In the 22nd century version of the tunnels,
   the Doctor and the guerrillas are separated when Ogrons pursue them.
   The Doctor climbs out of the tunnels onto the surface, where he sees a
   Dalek order Ogrons to exterminate some rebels. When the Controller
   informs the Daleks that Jo mentioned a "Doctor", the Daleks react
   violently, declaring that the Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks and must
   be exterminated.

   The Doctor stumbles into what appears to be a factory, and is captured
   by an Ogron. The Controller arrives, and takes the Doctor to see Jo.
   The manager of the factory contacts the guerrillas, who have made it
   back to their base with their leader, a man named Monia. The manager
   tells them of the Doctor, but he is discovered by an Ogron and killed.
   Monia decides that they must rescue the Doctor, because he seems to be
   the only man that the Daleks are actually afraid of.

   After an abortive escape attempt, the Doctor is strapped down to a
   Dalek mind analysis device, where images of the two previous Doctors
   are shown to confirm to the Daleks that he is, indeed, their sworn
   enemy. The Controller bursts in, saying that using the mind analysis
   device will kill the Doctor. He then says that they should keep the
   Doctor alive for information on the rebels, and that he will question
   the Doctor personally. The Daleks gloat to the Doctor that they have
   discovered time travel, invaded Earth again, and changed the course of
   history. The Controller explains that at the end of the 20th century,
   100 years of devastating worldwide wars began, killing 7/8ths of the
   population and forcing the rest to live in little more than holes in
   the ground. It was during this period that the Daleks invaded,
   conquering the world and using it for raw materials to fuel the
   expansion of their empire.

   The rebel guerrillas attack the Controller's base and rescue the
   Doctor, though Boaz is killed. The rebels take the Doctor back to their
   hideout and tell him the rest of the story: Styles organised the peace
   conference, and when Auderly House was blown up, everyone was killed.
   The rebels believe that Styles engineered the whole thing and caused
   the century of war that followed. Their plan was to kill Styles before
   he could destroy the peace conference, thus stopping the century of war
   and subsequent Dalek invasion. The Doctor is sceptical, believing
   Styles to be stubborn, but a good man. When the Doctor finds out that
   the rebels had brought a bomb made of dalekanium with them, a powerful
   but unstable explosive that will even affect Dalek body casings, he
   realises that the rebels are caught in a predestination paradox. They
   will cause the very explosion that they went back in time to prevent in
   the first place, and thus create their own history and timeline.
   Indeed, back in the 20th century, Shura has found his way into Auderly
   House and plants the dalekanium bomb in the cellar.

   The Doctor and Jo make their way back to the tunnels so they can travel
   back and stop Shura, only to run into an ambush that the Controller has
   set up. The Doctor convinces the Controller that he has the means to
   stop the Daleks before they have even begun, and the Controller lets
   him go, only to be betrayed by an interrogator and exterminated by the
   Daleks. The Daleks send a strike force to the 20th century to ensure
   that their version of the future is preserved, and, with the Ogrons,
   attack as the delegates arrive at the house. In the ensuing battle
   between the Daleks, Ogrons and UNIT, the Brigadier evacuates the
   delegates. The Doctor, back in the present, makes his way down to the
   cellar to try to convince Shura not to activate the dalekanium bomb;
   Auderly House is empty, and it will all have been for nothing. However,
   once Shura hears that the Daleks and the Ogrons are entering the house,
   he tells the Doctor and Jo to leave. The Brigadier tells his men to
   fall back to the main road as the Daleks and the Ogrons search the
   house for the delegates and Styles, with the Daleks intent on carrying
   out their mission of destroying the peace conference. Shura detonates
   the dalekanium bomb, destroying both the house and everything in it.

   The Doctor tells Styles that it is now up to him to make the conference
   a success. Styles assures the Doctor that it will be, because they know
   what will happen if they fail. The Doctor, nodding at Jo, says that
   they know too.
