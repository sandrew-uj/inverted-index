   In the 22nd century year of 2172, long after the end of the Oil Age,
   the United States of America has become a neo-Victorian oligarchy, with
   the reintroduction of feudal indenture, a rigid class hierarchy,
   property-based representation in the federal United States Senate, de
   facto hereditary succession of the Presidency, establishment of the
   "Dominion of Jesus Christ" (premised on evangelicalism and
   organizationally based at Colorado Springs, Colorado) and the abolition
   of the Supreme Court. With the evacuation of Washington DC due to an
   unspecified cataclysm, Manhattan, New York has become the national
   capital. The United States has also annexed most of Canada and
   comprises sixty states, but is fighting German-controlled Mitteleuropa
   ("the Dutch") in the contested territory of Labrador. Climate change
   and peak oil have caused technological reversion, exacerbated by the
   Dominion's repressive social policies.

   Deklan Comstock, the hereditary President, has already arranged the
   death of his brother Bryce. The latter's widow, Emily, sends her son
   Julian to the remote rural western boreal district of Athabaska, where
   the egalitarian and free-thinking young man befriends Adam Hazzard, a
   fledgling writer. The two travel east by railroad, but are press-ganged
   into the "Army of the Laurentians", and are sent to the campaigns in
   Labrador. Julian becomes a war hero and foils his uncle's machinations.
   During the celebrations in Manhattan that follow, his actual identity
   is disclosed. A coup d'etat deposes his uncle and Julian is appointed
   President. He proceeds to upset the status quo through liberalising
   censorship policy, rehabilitating the image of Charles Darwin (the
   authorities have suppressed the ideas of Darwinian evolution in this
   world) and reimposing separation of church and state as public policy.
   He also emerges as gay, falling for Magnus, a Unitarian-style minister.

   Unfortunately, the Dominion and the armed forces revolt and Julian and
   Magnus catch "the Pox" and die alongside one another, but Adam and
   Calyxa, his equally free-thinking and feminist wife, escape to
   Mediterranean France, where Adam writes his friend's posthumous
   biography twenty years later, in 2192. Julian Comstock's life parallels
   that of Julian the Apostate, with the new America being modeled on the
   Roman Empire. The President is modeled on the Roman Emperor, with
   the military having significant power in the choice of President (as in
   the Roman Empire).
