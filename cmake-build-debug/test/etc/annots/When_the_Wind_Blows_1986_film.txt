   Jim and Hilda Bloggs are an elderly couple living in a tidy isolated
   cottage in rural Sussex, in southeast England. Jim frequently travels
   to the local town to read newspapers and keep abreast of the
   deteriorating international situation regarding the Soviet-Afghan War;
   while frequently misunderstanding some specifics of the conflict, he is
   fully aware of the growing risk of an all-out nuclear war with the
   Soviet Union. Jim is horrified at a radio news report stating that a
   war may be only three days away, and sets about preparing for the worst
   as instructed by his government-issued Protect and Survive pamphlets.
   As Hilda continues her daily routine, and their son Ron (living
   elsewhere), who is implied to have fallen into fatalistic despair,
   dismisses such preparations as pointless (referencing the song "We'll
   All Go Together When We Go" by Tom Lehrer), Jim builds a lean-to
   shelter out of several doors inside their home (which he consistently
   calls the "inner core or refuge" per the pamphlets) and prepares a
   stock of supplies. As Jim goes on a shopping trip for the food
   supplies, he is unable to get any bread, due to "panic purchasing". He
   also follows through seemingly strange instructions such as painting
   his windows with white paint and readying sacks to lie down in when a
   nuclear strike hits. Despite Jim's concerns, he and Hilda are confident
   they can survive the war, as they did World War II in their childhoods,
   and that a Soviet defeat will ensue.

   Hearing a warning on the radio of an imminent ICBM strike, Jim rushes
   himself and Hilda into their shelter, just escaping injury as distant
   shock waves batter their home. They remain in the shelter for a couple
   of nights, and when they emerge, they find all their utilities,
   services and communications have been destroyed by the nuclear blast.
   In spite of the shelter Jim has built, over the following days, they
   gradually grow sick from exposure to the radioactive fallout, resulting
   in radiation poisoning. Ron and his wife Beryl are not heard from
   again, though their deaths are heavily implied.

   In spite of all this, Jim and Hilda stoically attempt to carry on,
   preparing tea and dinners on a camping stove, noting numerous errands
   they will have to run once the crisis passes, and trying to renew their
   evaporated water stock with (contaminated) rainwater. Jim keeps faith
   that a rescue operation will be launched to help civilians. They step
   out into the garden, where radioactive ash has blocked out the sun and
   caused heavy fog. They are oblivious to the dead animals and the few
   remaining animals suffering from the radiation (or feeding on the dead
   in the case of rats), the destroyed buildings of the nearby town and
   scorched, dead vegetation outside their cottage (aside from their own
   garden). The couple initially remains optimistic; however, as they take
   in the debris of their home, prolonged isolation, lack of food and
   water, growing radiation sickness, and confusion about the events that
   have taken place, they begin to fall into a state of despair.

   As they continue to attempt to survive, Jim worries that the Russian
   military will come to attack their house (having a vision where a tall,
   red eyed Russian soldier with a bayoneted tommy gun breaks into their
   house), and that they will have to kill them or be sent to a
   concentration camp. Hilda humorously suggests offering a cup of tea to
   them, saying that "Russians like tea". The Russian military never comes
   however, as they too were wiped out by the nuclear war.

   As Hilda's symptoms are worsening, she encounters a rat in the dried
   toilet, which frightens her severely. Her encounter with the rat, as
   well as her worrying symptoms - bloody diarrhoea (which Jim says is
   haemorrhoids), and her bleeding gums (which Jim says is caused by
   ill-fitting dentures) - cause her to be become slightly more suspicious
   of her impending fate. Jim still tries to comfort her, still optimistic
   that he may be able to get medications for her from the chemist.

   After a few days, the Bloggs are practically bedridden, and Hilda is
   despondent when her hair begins to fall out, after vomiting, developing
   painful sores and lesions. Either in denial, unaware of the extent of
   the nuclear holocaust, unable to comprehend it, or trying to comfort
   Hilda. Jim is still confident that emergency services will eventually
   arrive, but they never do. Hilda is subliminally aware of her fate, and
   suggests getting back into the paper sacks. Jim, now losing the last of
   his optimism, agrees to Hilda's suggestion. The film ends with the
   dying Jim and Hilda getting into the paper sacks, crawling back into
   the shelter, and praying. Jim tries several different prayers as well
   as Psalm 23, but, forgetting the lines, ends with "The Charge of the
   Light Brigade." The line "into the valley of the shadow of death"
   distresses the dying Hilda, who weakly asks him not to continue.
   Finally, Jim's voice mumbles away into silence as he finishes the line,
   "...rode the Six Hundred..."

   Outside the shelter, the smoke and ash-filled sky begins to clear,
   revealing the sun rising through the gloom. At the very end of the
   credits, a Morse code signal taps out "MAD", which stands for mutual
   assured destruction, implying that the world has indeed ended.
