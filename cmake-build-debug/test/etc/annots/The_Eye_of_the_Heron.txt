   The Eye of the Heron is a science fiction novel set on the fictional
   planet of Victoria in a speculative future, probably sometime in the
   22nd century, when the planet has been colonized for about a century
   and has no communication with Earth. The protagonist is a young woman
   called Luz but the story is told in the third person and the reader
   sees events from the point of view of several different characters. The
   Eye of the Heron is usually treated as one of Le Guin's minor novels
   although it exhibits her characteristic prose style and themes.
