   Jagang, Emperor of the Imperial Order, has invoked a bound fork
   prophecy binding Richard and Kahlan to a fate of pain, betrayal, and a
   path to the Underworld. At Jagang's behest a Sister of the Dark gains
   access into the fabled Temple of the Winds and has unleashed a plague
   that sweeps across the lands like a firestorm consuming lives at an
   alarming rate. To stop the plague Richard and Kahlan are forced to
   sacrifice everything they have between them.
