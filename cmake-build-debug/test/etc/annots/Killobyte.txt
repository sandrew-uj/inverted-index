   The novel cuts between Walter Toland, a former police officer, and Baal
   Curran, an angst-ridden teenage girl. Both are playing Killobyte from
   their own home, hooked to the network through a telephone modem. Walter
   notices Baal's name on a list and initially assumes she is a man.
   Indeed, each of them first poses as the other sex.

   Walter is learning the game as he goes, having neglected to read the
   instruction manual. He narrowly survives attacks by gunslingers,
   snakes, and runaway vehicles. Each time he destroys an enemy, he
   receives a point, and a door to a new setting appears. Eventually he
   must solve a more complicated problem when he finds himself in a
   women's prison, evading execution and a possible mole.

   In the meantime, Baal enters a fantasy setting in which a knight must
   rescue a princess from an evil sorcerer in a castle guarded by a
   dragon. She first goes through the adventure as the knight and fails.
   When she tries again, this time in the role of the princess, Walter has
   entered the setting as the sorcerer. He captures Baal under the ruse
   that he is the hero, but when she makes sexual advances at him, he
   tells her the truth, too honourable to take advantage of her even if it
   is only within a game.

   They begin telling each other about their real lives. In his days as a
   cop, he had an affair with a battered woman he was protecting, and the
   jealous husband ran him down with a car, leaving him paralysed from the
   waist down. He still has sexual feelings but is unable to perform.
   Baal, a plain girl despite her voluptuous appearance in the game, has
   type I diabetes and is depressed from having recently broken up with
   her boyfriend, who couldn't handle her disease. She pursued the game as
   a way of flirting with suicide.

   They discover that he may be capable of sex within the game, but they
   are interrupted by a hacker who has infiltrated the software. Calling
   himself Phreak, the hacker targets specific individuals and locks them
   in the game so that he can harass them. Walter receives an error
   message every time he attempts to return to the real world. Aided by
   his police training, he remains calm and talks to Phreak, even though
   he knows his real body is in danger of eventual dehydration.

   Baal temporarily quits the game after agreeing to meet Walter later in
   the game's next section, where they would use signals to identify each
   other, since they would have a different appearance. After
   unsuccessfully trying to get the police involved, she contacts the
   game's company, who want Walter to stay in the game as bait so that
   they can capture Phreak, who has eluded authorities for years. They
   give Baal a patch that will lock Phreak in the game along with Walter,
   so that they can force him to give the code that will free Walter.

   We learn that Phreak is a 15-year-old boy whose father was part of a
   snake handling sect and died of a rattlesnake bite. The mother
   eventually died, and Phreak is convinced that she was also killed by
   snakes, which he believes lurk in the shadows waiting to pounce on him.
   He lives in his aunt's house, secretly using his own telephone line to
   hack into games, but he avoids experiencing the games directly for fear
   of being traced, despite the temptations of online sex.

   Baal reenters the game world. Unfortunately, the next section is
   especially violent and unpredictable, modelled after Beirut. She poses
   as an Israeli spy, he as a Druze, and after several dangerous
   adventures they find each other, but not before Phreak catches up with
   them. Baal successfully sets the patch on Phreak, locking him in the
   game, though he has now locked her inside as well. They all end up in a
   prison together, and Walter tries to force the information out of
   Phreak, while Baal makes motions to seduce him, but he resists their
   methods.

   Walter bombs the prison, causing their virtual deaths (so that they
   will no longer be imprisoned when they reappear). Walter believes that
   if his character dies again, he will die for real, for the electric
   shocks are interfering with his pacemaker and causing heart
   palpitations. Baal, meanwhile, is in danger of insulin shock if she
   does not exit the game soon. Phreak is traumatised by the game's
   simulated death and is terrified of experiencing it again, but he will
   not volunteer that information to Walter, whom he decides to kill.

   They all end up in a special section called Potpourri, which mixes
   elements of various other sections. Baal is able to track the
   approximate locations of Walter and Phreak. Walter and Baal decide they
   are in love and want to marry if they manage to survive their current
   ordeal and meet in the real world. They chase Phreak across Potpourri,
   evading various obstacles he places in their path. Baal goes into
   insulin shock and her game body becomes still. Walter finally corners
   Phreak on a train and threatens to encase him in a box with snakes.
   Phreak finally relents.

   Baal wakes up in a hospital, recovering from the insulin shock. She
   tries calling Walter, whose number she has memorised, but she gets no
   answer. She has her ex-boyfriend drive her across the country, and it
   gives him a chance to assuage his guilty conscience as he is comforted
   that she has found love again. Phreak has manipulated police records so
   that there is a phony arrest warrant on Walter, but the friends he met
   in Killobyte show up and refute the charges. A small party is held
   where Walter and Baal meet face-to-face at last.
