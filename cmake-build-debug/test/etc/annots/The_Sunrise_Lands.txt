   Ingolf Vogeler, a mercenary from the Republic of Richland arrives in
   Mackenzie lands in the Willamette River region of Oregon. He is being
   stalked by soldiers from the Church Universal and Triumphant (known as
   Cutters), which is located in Paradise Valley, Montana, and controls
   parts of Montana and Wyoming. Ingolf arrives in a tavern run by Tom
   Brannigan, and during the night, is attacked by these soldiers. As he
   is attacked, Rudi Mackenzie, Mathilda Arminger, Odard Liu, and the
   twins Ritva and Mary Havel join the fray. Odard and Rudi kill several
   assassins until Rudi shouts to take one alive. The assassins realize
   they can't escape and commit suicide before the party can react. Odard
   and Rudi break the door that Ingolf is hidden behind, and take him to a
   hospital. Ingolf is saved, and he relates his tale to the Mackenzies.

   It turns out that he had traveled to Nantucket with his mercenary
   company during an expedition to collect pre-Change relics. Along with
   two mercenary scouts (Kaur and Singh) and Kuttner, a guard of the
   bossman of Iowa travelling with the company, Ingolf saw a vision that
   told him to: Travel from sunrise to the sunset, and seek the Son of the
   Bear Who Rules. The Sword of the Lady waits for him.

   The party traveled back to the mainland to hook up with the remainder
   of the mercenaries, but they were all found dead somewhere in Illinois.
   Ingolf led the party west, but they are stopped by Cutter forces. The
   party is then betrayed by the guard, Kuttner, who turns out to be a
   Cutter officer. While fleeing, Kaur is wounded, and she and her brother
   dismount and turn to hold off the Cutters while Ingolf flees. Kaur and
   Singh make Ingolf swear to avenge them. Ingolf is able to escape the
   Cutter forces due to the sacrifice of the scouts, however he is later
   captured and taken to the C.U.T capitol, but manages to escape later
   on.

   Ingolf then arrived at Mackenzie territory and tells Juniper and Rudi
   Mackenzie his story. Both interpret the vision to mean that Rudi, who
   was prophesied to be the Sword of the Lady, has to go east to
   Nantucket. After a brief debate, Rudi, Ingolf, Mary, Ritva, and Edain
   Aylward, set off for Nantucket. As they travel, they split up, and meet
   back up at the house of John Brown, an important member of the Central
   Oregon Ranchers Association and ally of the Mackenzies. In the meantime
   Mathilda, Odard, as well as Odard's servant Alex, and the monk Father
   Ignatius, have joined the party, fleeing Protectorate territory and
   avoiding being brought back by Regent Arminger's men-at-arms.

   The party travels further east saving a group of Mormons from Rovers,
   nomadic brigands of southeastern Oregon. They learn that the Church
   Universal and Triumphant are at war with the Mormon state of New
   Deseret and are on the verge of defeating them. Later the party runs
   into a Cutter army in southern Idaho. They warn President Thurston,
   leader of the United States of "Boise", who defeats the force with his
   personal soldiers while Rudi and Edain save him from an assassination
   attempt by his own guards.

   The party travels to Boise to figure out why the Church wants Thurston
   dead, while Boise prepares for war against the Church. Taking the army
   of Boise south, Thurston meets with a demoralized Deseret army and
   agree to fight together against Cutter forces besieging the Deseret
   city of Twin Falls. During the combat, President Thurston is
   assassinated by his son, Martin Thurston, who is allied with the
   Cutters in an effort to make himself the dictator of Boise. Rudi and
   Thurston's younger son witness this and flee, warning the rest of the
   party. The party splits up to avoid being captured by the Cutters,
   traveling east and planning to meet up at a rally point. Mathilda,
   Odard, and Alex are cornered in a rocky ravine when Odard's horse is
   killed and Odard becomes injured. He and Mathilda turn to make a last
   stand, but Alex, under orders from Odard's mother to protect him at all
   costs, betrays them to the Cutters, and the trio are captured. Edain,
   Father Ignatius, Thurston's youngest son, Mary, and Ritva arrive at the
   rendezvous point but flee because of advancing Cutters. They encounter
   Boise forces and are taken in a pedal-powered airship to save Rudi from
   pursuing Cutter forces. In the meantime, Ingolf is captured by the
   Cutters, who are led by Kuttner, who mysteriously forces Ingolf to drop
   his machete and takes him prisoner.

   Meanwhile, the forces of the C.U.T. succeed in breaching the walls of
   Twin Falls, capturing the city and on the orders of their leader the
   Prophet Sethaz, massacres the entire population.^[2]
