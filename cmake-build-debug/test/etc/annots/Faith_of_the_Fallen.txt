   The Imperial Order continues to bring an undesired war upon the New
   World. Its mission is to enslave the world in a system in which no
   human being can aspire to anything more than mediocrity. Meanwhile,
   Richard, Cara and Kahlan return to Westland. Richard believes that if
   he leads the armies of the New World directly into a confrontation with
   the armies of the Imperial Order, he will lose the battle and the New
   World will fall prey to the grasp of death and slavery.

   Kahlan is nursed back to health after a brutal beating she received at
   the hands of Anderith's messengers at the end of the last book, Soul of
   the Fire. Just as she achieves her recovery, Nicci, a long time slave
   of Jagang and the Imperial Order, arrives to take Richard away.

   Kahlan and Cara pack their things and decide to return to the D'Haran
   armies. There they, too, will battle with the Imperial Order.
