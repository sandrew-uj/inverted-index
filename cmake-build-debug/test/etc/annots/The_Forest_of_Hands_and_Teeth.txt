   Mary lives in a town ruled by the Sisterhood and the Guardians. The
   village is surrounded by fences; beyond lies only forest. There are
   only three ways through the fence: gates that open on paths that are
   themselves enclosed by fencing, expelling those who've been infected.
   Where the two paths lead, no one knows, for the Sisterhood says the
   village is the only human habitation left on Earth.

   Mary has been raised on stories passed down from her
   great-great-great-grandmother about life before the coming of zombies.
   She is especially fascinated by the ocean and believes if she could
   reach it, she would be free.

   Her adventure starts when there is a breaching in the fence. Mary must
   escape, find true love, and friendship while figuring out the mystery
   behind the other gates and fences. After a sad, hectic, twisted turn of
   events she finds the ocean, but it isn't at all what she expected.
