   Stingo, a novelist who is recalling the summer when he began his first
   novel, has been fired from his low-level reader's job at the publisher
   McGraw-Hill and has moved into a cheap boarding house in Brooklyn,
   where he hopes to devote some months to his writing. While he is
   working on his novel, he is drawn into the lives of the lovers Nathan
   Landau and Sophie Zawistowska, fellow boarders at the house, who are
   involved in an intense and difficult relationship. Sophie is beautiful,
   Polish, and Catholic, and a survivor of the Holocaust and Nazi
   concentration camps; Nathan is a Jewish-American, and, purportedly, a
   genius. Although Nathan claims to be a Harvard graduate and a cellular
   biologist with a pharmaceutical company, it is later revealed that this
   is a fabrication. Almost no one--including Sophie and Stingo--knows
   that Nathan has paranoid schizophrenia and is abusing stimulants. He
   sometimes behaves quite normally and generously, but there are times
   when he becomes frighteningly jealous, violent, abusive and delusional.

   As the story progresses, Sophie tells Stingo of her past. She describes
   her violently anti-Semitic father, a law professor in Krakow; her
   unwillingness to help him spread his ideas; her arrest by the Nazis;
   and particularly, her brief stint as a stenographer-typist in the home
   of Rudolf Hoess, the commander of Auschwitz, where she was interned.
   She specifically relates her attempts to seduce Hoess in an effort to
   persuade him that her blond, blue-eyed, German-speaking son should be
   allowed to leave the camp and enter the Lebensborn program, in which he
   would be raised as a German child. She failed in this attempt and,
   ultimately, never learned of her son's fate. Only at the end of the
   book does the reader also learn what became of Sophie's daughter, named
   Eva.

   Later, Nathan's delusions have led him to believe that Stingo is having
   an affair with Sophie, and he threatens to kill them both.

   As Sophie and Stingo attempt to flee New York, Sophie reveals her
   deepest, darkest secret: on the night that she arrived at Auschwitz, a
   camp doctor made her choose which of her two children would die
   immediately by gassing and which would continue to live, albeit in the
   camp. Of her two children, Sophie chose to sacrifice her eight-year-old
   daughter, Eva, in a decision that has left her in mourning and filled
   with a guilt that she cannot overcome. By now alcoholic and deeply
   depressed, she is clearly willing to self-destruct with Nathan, who has
   already tried to persuade her to commit suicide with him. Despite the
   fact that Stingo proposes marriage to her, and despite a shared night
   that relieves Stingo of his virginity and fulfills many of his sexual
   fantasies, Sophie disappears, leaving only a note in which she says
   that she must return to Nathan.

   Upon arriving back in Brooklyn, Stingo is devastated to discover that
   Sophie and Nathan have committed suicide by ingesting sodium cyanide.
