   The film is set in a town after a nuclear war, the town is destroyed
   and polluted with radioactive elements. The main character, Professor
   Larsen, played by Rolan Bykov, is a Nobel Prize in Physics laureate,
   who lives in the basement of a museum along with his sick wife and
   several other people who used to work at the museum. He often writes
   letters to his son Eric, though he has no way of contacting him. Larsen
   believes the war has ended and that more surviving humans exist outside
   the central bunker, but nobody else believes his theories.

   Larsen visits an orphanage where the current caretaker of the surviving
   children explains that she's thinking of evacuating to the central
   bunker, though may have to leave the children behind as they likely
   won't be allowed in since they're sick, to Larsen's disapproval. Larsen
   is informed that he also might be rejected from entering the central
   bunker due to his old age. With his wife's health declining, Larsen
   sneaks past several soldiers during curfew hours and attempts to find
   medicine for his wife, escaping from a military raid in the process.
   When he returns to the museum's basement, however, he finds that his
   wife died. The other museum employees bury her body.

   In one of his letters to Eric, Larsen tells a darkly humorous story on
   how someone failed to prevent the nuclear war. According to him, an
   operator from an electronics center had a chance to cancel the first
   missile launch (which happened due to a computer error), but was unable
   to reach the computer in time to abort the launch as he was slowed down
   by a cup of coffee in his hands. The operator then hung himself in
   return.

   Larsen makes a trip to the central bunker in an effort to find Eric.
   After sneaking into a medical facility, he enters the children's
   department, only to find all the children sick, injured, and screaming
   in agony, much to Larsen's horror (it's assumed he didn't find Eric
   amongst them).

   After returning to the museum's basement, he finds that a museum
   employee is about to take his life as he thinks the history of mankind
   has ended and that mankind was doomed from the very beginning. He then
   leaves the group, lies down in a grave, and shoots himself dead, to the
   horror of his son. Later, while salvaging books from a flooded library,
   Larsen talks with a man who disagrees with his theory on how there's
   hope for mankind, referencing how Jesus said mankind was doomed.

   Larsen visits the orphanage where he learns the children were rejected
   from entering the central bunker. The caretaker leaves the children for
   Larsen to look after, as she is evacuating to the central bunker
   herself. The remaining museum employees also evacuate to the central
   bunker, though Larsen stays behind to look after the children (it's
   assumed they're the only people left in the town). On Christmas Day,
   Larsen creates a makeshift Christmas tree out of sticks and candles
   while the children design Christmas ornaments to decorate it with. In
   his final letter to Eric, Larsen writes that he finally found purpose
   in life and that he hopes his son doesn't leave him alone in the world.

   The final scene is narrated by one of the children Larsen looked after,
   who explains that Larsen died some time later. On his deathbed, he told
   the children to leave the museum and find somewhere else to go while
   they have the strength, still believing that life exists elsewhere. The
   film ends with the children wandering through the apocalyptic landscape
   together, their fates unknown.
