   Jane Eyre is divided into 38 chapters. It was originally published in
   three volumes in the 19th century, comprising chapters 1 to 15, 16 to
   27, and 28 to 38.

   The second edition was dedicated to William Makepeace Thackeray.

   The novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title
   character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in
   the reign of George III (1760-1820). It has five distinct stages:
   Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and
   physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood
   School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations
   and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she
   falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester;
   her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman
   cousin, St. John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion
   with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these
   sections, it provides perspectives on a number of important social
   issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.
