   The novel's protagonist, Iris Chase, and her sister Laura, grow up
   well-off but motherless in a small town in southern Ontario. As an old
   woman, Iris recalls the events and relationships of her childhood,
   youth and middle age, including her unhappy marriage to Toronto
   businessman Richard Griffen. The book includes a novel within a novel,
   the eponymous Blind Assassin, a roman `a clef attributed to Laura but
   published by Iris. It is about Alex Thomas, a politically radical
   author of pulp science fiction who has an ambiguous relationship with
   the sisters. That embedded story itself contains a third tale, a
   science fiction story told by Alex's fictional counterpart to the
   second novel's protagonist, believed to be Laura's fictional
   counterpart.

   The novel takes the form of a gradual revelation illuminating both
   Iris's youth and her old age before coming to the pivotal events of her
   and Laura's lives around the time of the Second World War. Laura and
   Iris live in a house called Avilion. Their mother dies at a young age
   leaving Reenie, the caretaker, to take on full responsibility for the
   girls. As the novel unfolds, and the novel-within-a-novel becomes ever
   more obviously inspired by real events, Iris, not Laura, is revealed to
   be the novel-within-a-novel's true author and protagonist. Though the
   novel-within-a-novel had long been believed to be inspired by Laura's
   romance with Alex, it is revealed that The Blind Assassin was written
   by Iris based on her extramarital affair with Alex. Iris later
   published the work in Laura's name after Laura committed suicide upon
   learning of Alex's death in the war. Following the suicide, Iris
   realizes through her sister's journals that Richard had been raping
   Laura for much of their marriage, blackmailing her to comply with him
   by threatening to turn Alex in to the authorities. Iris takes her young
   daughter Aimee and flees her home, threatening to reveal that Richard
   had impregnated Laura and forced an abortion on her. This move
   estranges Iris from the last people who were supporting her, and
   creates bitterness between her and the grown Aimee. Iris deceives
   Richard into believing that Laura was the one having an affair with
   Alex Thomas, which drives him to commit suicide. The novel ends as Iris
   dies, leaving the truth to be discovered in her unpublished
   autobiography that she leaves to her sole surviving granddaughter.

   The book is set in the fictional Ontario town of Port Ticonderoga and
   in the Toronto of the 1930s and 1940s. It is a work of historical
   fiction with the major events of Canadian history forming an important
   backdrop. Greater verisimilitude is given by a series of newspaper
   articles commenting on events and on the novel's characters from a
   distance.
