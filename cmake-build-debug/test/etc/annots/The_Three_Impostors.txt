   The novel comprises several weird tales and culminates in a final
   denouement of deadly horror, connected with a secret society devoted to
   debauched pagan rites. The three impostors of the title are members of
   this society who weave a web of deception in the streets of
   London--relating the aforementioned weird tales in the process--as they
   search for a missing Roman coin commemorating an infamous orgy by the
   Emperor Tiberius and close in on their prey: "the young man with
   spectacles".^[1]
