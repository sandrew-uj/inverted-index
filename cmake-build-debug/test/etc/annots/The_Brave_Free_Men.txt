   The land of Shant on the planet Durdane is ruled by a purposely
   anonymous dictator called the Anome or Faceless Man. He maintains
   control by virtue of the torc, a ring of explosive placed around the
   neck of every adult in Shant.

   The Anome is the product of a self-perpetuating, self-selecting
   dynasty. When one Anome grows old, he chooses his successor, a system
   hundreds of years old. The reason for this harsh system of government
   is the extreme individuality of the folk of Shant. They are divided
   into dozens of different cantons, each with very distinctive customs
   and laws, united only by a common language. Prior to the ascendancy of
   the Faceless Man, Shant was plagued by constant civil war and
   dissension. The Faceless Man not only provides the glue that holds
   Shant together; he communicates anonymously with the cantonal leaders.
   Those who lose their heads are largely those who have violated local
   law.

   The protagonist of the trilogy is Gastel Etzwane, the son of a
   prostitute and an anonymous musician. The first two volumes chronicle
   his coming of age, his discovery of the identity of his father, his
   struggles to become a musician himself, the murder of his mother and
   sister by a race of alien barbarian invaders known as the Roguskhoi,
   and his struggle for revenge against them. This leads to Etzwane's
   discovering the identity of the Anome, who, strangely passive, refuses
   to mobilize the armies of Shant against the aliens. Etzwane is forced
   to assume the role of Anome himself and, through luck and
   improvisation, leads an eventually successful struggle against the
   invaders. In response to the social upheaval caused by the war, Etzwane
   lays down his office, and the torc system is abolished.

   In the third and final volume, Etzwane learns - the hard way - that the
   invaders were the creation of an alien race known as the Asutra, who
   designed these caricatures of humanity in a first assay at biological
   warfare against the peoples of Durdane. Since the Roguskhoi are all
   males, they can only reproduce by sexual intercourse with human women,
   and they are insanely lustful. The resulting "imps" have no genetic
   relationship to the human mother, who is a host only. This process, by
   design, also renders the woman sterile.

   The trilogy is set in the same broad Gaean Reach milieu of many of
   Vance's books. Like most of his work, it is full of color, ornately
   bizarre cultures and heroic adventure.
