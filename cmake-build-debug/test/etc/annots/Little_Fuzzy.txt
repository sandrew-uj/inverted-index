   Protagonist Jack Holloway lives a solitary life mining valuable
   "sunstones" in the wilderness of the planet Zarathustra, managed by
   Victor Grego's Chartered Zarathustra Company, which built colonial
   outposts there and now reaps the benefits of the planet's resources.
   One day, Holloway meets a small golden-furred humanoid whom he names
   "Little Fuzzy", who soon introduces Holloway to his family. Holloway
   cares for the Fuzzies and spreads word of their apparently intelligent
   behavior. When the Company discovers that the Fuzzies' intelligence may
   qualify them as a sapient species, the Company moves against them, as
   the discovery of sapient native Zarathustrans would turn the planet
   into a protected aboriginal zone, install a proper government there,
   and deprive the Company of its complete control of the planet's
   resources.

   Leonard Kellogg, one of Grego's staff, manages a team of scientists
   working to legally disprove the Fuzzies' sapience at all costs.
   Holloway suspects Kellogg's intentions and resists him. When Kellogg
   kills a Fuzzy in anger, Holloway has him charged with murder, leaving
   the Fuzzies' sapience to be determined in court. In the midst of the
   proceedings, it is proven that Fuzzies have at least the mental
   capacity of a ten-year-old human child and speak to each other
   ultrasonically. Kellogg kills himself in his cell, but the prosecution
   continues, and the court officially rules that the Fuzzies are sapient
   beings, invalidating the Company's charter. Holloway and his allies are
   given Fuzzy-related positions in the new government.
