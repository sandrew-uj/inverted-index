   The story is set in between the events of Resident Evil 6 and Resident
   Evil 7: Biohazard. BSAA agent Chris Redfield is tracking Glenn Arias, a
   Brazilian-American death merchant and a former CIA operative who is
   wanted by both the Interpol and FBI. Arias is on a mission of vengeance
   against the U.S. government for killing his friends and family in a
   drone strike at his wedding. Chris and his fellow agents infiltrate a
   mansion in Mexico, to rescue their missing undercover source, Cathy
   White. Inside the mansion, Chris's fellow agents are ambushed by
   zombies and death traps, with Chris being the sole survivor and barely
   making it out alive. Chris then comes face-to-face with Arias outside
   the mansion and is defeated by him in close quarters combat. Arias then
   reveals that Cathy has become a zombie under his control. As Arias
   leaves with his associates, Maria and Diego Gomez, the BSAA rescues
   Chris by slaughtering Cathy and the remaining zombie horde. Four months
   later, Professor Rebecca Chambers, former S.T.A.R.S. unit member and
   survivor of the Mansion incident, studies a new virus coined the
   "Animality Virus"--"A-virus" for short--that is capable of laying
   dormant inside any individual until the right trigger is presented. She
   identifies three components to the virus: the base virus, the
   triggering virus, and the vaccine. The research labs are attacked by
   Maria and releases the virus via aerosol form. While her colleagues
   quickly turn into zombies, Rebecca is able to formulate a vaccine to
   make herself immune. After fending off some zombies, Rebecca is then
   rescued by Chris, who briefs her on his mission.

   Rebecca recognizes the zombies' loyalty to the host and makes a
   connection to Las Plagas, the bioweapon used by the Los Illuminados who
   Leon once encountered in Europe, and theorizes that the remaining
   members of the cult are providing information to Arias in developing
   the A-virus. Both make contact with DSO agent Leon S. Kennedy in
   Colorado. Chris and Rebecca try to get a guilt-ridden Leon on board the
   mission, but the trio is soon attacked by Maria and Diego. They succeed
   in capturing Rebecca, while Chris and Leon, who finally agrees to help
   to finish the mission once and for all, team up to plan a rescue
   operation and decrypt Arias's plan of a large-scale attack on New York
   City.

   Arias intends to make Rebecca his bride as she shares a striking
   resemblance to his late wife. It is also revealed here that Diego and
   Maria are father and daughter, and close friends of Arias who also
   survived the wedding massacre. Arias develops a new strain of the
   A-virus which resists Rebeccas' vaccine, and injects it into her. Arias
   then challenges Chris to rescue Rebecca within twenty minutes, after
   which the virus will take full effect on Rebecca. As Arias's associates
   initiate their attack on New York City by releasing the virus-laden gas
   via tankers, Leon and Chris's new BSAA team--D.C., Damian, and
   Nadia--manage to destroy the vehicles, contain the virus and
   incapacitate Maria in the process, although Damian is brutally
   decapitated by zombie dogs in the process. Chris, later joined by Leon,
   then infiltrates Arias's safe house, defeats Diego and rescues Rebecca.
   On the terrace, Chris engages Arias in close-quarter combat and throws
   Arias through the glass terrace below to his demise. Diego then arrives
   and, despite being badly injured after being defeated by Chris, merges
   with Arias to form a new Tyrant monster. Chris is no match against the
   Tyrant until Leon joins the fight after working his way through the
   safe house, mowing down zombies. With the assistance of D.C. and Nadia,
   they manage to trap the Tyrant, at which point Chris finishes it off
   with a grenade launcher. They are then able to locate the antidote that
   Arias kept and successfully cure Rebecca before escaping by helicopter.
   As the team spreads the antidote across the city to cure the rest of
   the infected, Leon and Chris wonder what may lie ahead.

   The epilogue features Maria being alive and vowing vengeance for her
   father's and Arias' deaths.
