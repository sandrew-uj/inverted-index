   Snow-White and Rose-Red are two little girls living with their mother,
   a poor widow, in a small cottage by the woods. Fair-haired Snow-White
   is quiet and shy and prefers to spend her time indoors, doing housework
   and reading. Dark-haired Rose-Red is outspoken, lively and cheerful,
   and prefers to be outside. They are both very good girls who love each
   other and their mother dearly, and their mother is very fond of them as
   well.

   One winter night, there is a knock at the door. Rose-Red opens the door
   to find a bear. At first, she is terrified, but the bear tells her not
   to be afraid. "I'm half frozen and I merely want to warm up a little at
   your place," he says. They let the bear in, and he lies down in front
   of the fire. Snow-White and Rose-Red beat the snow off the bear, and
   they quickly become quite friendly with him. They play with the bear
   and roll him around playfully. They let the bear spend the night in
   front of the fire. In the morning, he leaves trotting out into the
   woods. The bear comes back every night for the rest of that winter and
   the family grows used to him.

   When summer comes, the bear tells them that he must go away for a while
   to guard his treasure from a wicked dwarf. During the summer, when the
   girls are walking through the forest, they find a dwarf whose beard is
   stuck in a tree. The girls rescue him by cutting his beard free, but
   the dwarf is ungrateful and yells at them for cutting his beautiful
   beard. The girls encounter the dwarf several times that summer, rescue
   him from some peril each time and the dwarf is ungrateful.

   Then one day, they meet the dwarf once again. This time, he is
   terrified because the bear is about to kill him. The dwarf pleads with
   the bear and begs it to eat the girls. Instead, the bear pays no heed
   to his plea and kills the dwarf with one swipe of his paw. Instantly,
   the bear turns into a prince. The dwarf had previously put a spell on
   the prince by stealing his precious stones and turning him into a bear.
   The curse is broken with the death of the dwarf. Snow-White marries the
   prince and Rose-Red marries the prince's brother.
