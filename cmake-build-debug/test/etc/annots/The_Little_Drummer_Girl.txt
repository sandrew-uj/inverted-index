   Martin Kurtz, an Israeli spy working in a clandestine agency to allow
   plausible deniability for his superiors, recruits Charlie, a
   26-year-old radical left-wing English actress, as part of an elaborate
   scheme to discover the whereabouts of Khalil, a Palestinian terrorist.
   Joseph is Charlie's case officer. Khalil's younger brother Salim is
   abducted, interrogated, and killed by Kurtz's unit. Joseph impersonates
   Salim and travels through Europe with Charlie to make Khalil believe
   that Charlie and Salim are lovers. When Khalil discovers the affair and
   contacts Charlie, the Israelis are able to track him down.

   Charlie is taken to Palestinian refugee camps to be trained as a
   bomber. She becomes more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and her
   divided loyalties bring her close to collapse. Charlie is sent on a
   mission to place a bomb at a lecture given by an Israeli moderate whose
   peace proposals are not to Khalil's liking. She carries out the mission
   under the Israelis' supervision. As a result, Joseph kills Khalil.
   Charlie subsequently has a mental breakdown caused by the strain of her
   mission and her own internal contradictions.
