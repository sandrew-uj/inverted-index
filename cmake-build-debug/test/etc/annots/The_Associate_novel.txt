   As an idealistic graduate of Yale Law School, where he was
   editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal, Kyle McAvoy has the promise of
   a highly successful career, although after graduation, he intends to
   devote three years to public service before applying for employment
   with a prestigious firm.

   His plans are derailed when he is approached by two FBI agents (or such
   they seem) who interrogate him and then pass him on to a mysterious man
   known only as Bennie Wright. Bennie has a videotape of a party that
   took place in Kyle's apartment five years earlier, when he was an
   undergraduate student at Duquesne University. In it, two of Kyle's
   fraternity brothers, Joey Bernardo and Baxter Tate, are seen having
   sexual relations with Elaine Keenan, a co-ed who later claimed she was
   raped while unconscious, a charge seemingly supported by Joey's asking
   Baxter, "Is she awake?" on the tape.

   At the time, the incident was investigated by local police, who
   determined there had been no assault and declined to take further
   action. With the tape now in his possession, Bennie threatens to expose
   Kyle's secret unless he cooperates with Bennie and his associates.

   Bennie's plan is to have Kyle accept a position at New York City-based
   Scully & Pershing, the world's largest law firm, which is representing
   Trylon Aeronautics in its case against Bartin Dynamics. The two defense
   contractors had joined forces to design the B-10 HyperSonic Bomber for
   The Pentagon, and when they won the contract over Lockheed, the
   competitor sought support from senators and lobbyists. Legal battles
   ensued, and Trylon and Bartin, each laying claim to ownership of the
   design and technologies developed for the project, are now ready to
   wage battle against each other in court. Kyle will be required to
   infiltrate Scully & Pershing's files and deliver to Bennie crucial
   information desired by the people he represents.

   His first instinct is to ignore Bennie's blackmail threats and deal
   with whatever consequences might arise, but the thought of the shame
   and embarrassment his family would suffer if he is indicted for the
   incident in his past, not to mention the negative impact on his own
   future, leads him to agree to Bennie's demands.

   Constantly under surveillance while outdoors and living in an apartment
   in which he knows bugs and cameras have been hidden, Kyle slowly learns
   how to trick those who are trailing him into believing he is unaware of
   their presence. He seeks help from Joey, who has more to lose than Kyle
   does if the videotape is made public, and with his old friend as a
   somewhat unwilling accomplice, plots to outwit his blackmailer. He
   creates an interest in different spy novels, and buys them at a used
   book store. He learns about all the different technical components and
   devices used for spying and learns about a shop nearby, whose owners
   claimed to be "Ex-CIA," specializing in gadgets and devices specially
   used for surveillance.

   What he doesn't anticipate is the re-emergence of Elaine, who still
   maintains she was raped, and Baxter, who has completed a lengthy stint
   in rehab and, as part of his twelve-step program, wants to make amends
   to the girl he raped. His admission of guilt will give Elaine the proof
   she needs to file charges, and with Kyle drawn into the spotlight, his
   position at Scully & Pershing will be jeopardized, a risk Bennie must
   eliminate by any means. Baxter is found shot dead, with no evidence of
   the murderer's identity, although Kyle is certain that Bennie ordered
   it.

   After working at the law firm's 'boot camp' for some months, as do all
   new associates, Kyle eventually gets drawn into the Trylon case and is
   granted access to the highly secure computer room where the
   confidential information is stored. Bennie and Nigel, a computer
   expert, force him to use a thumbdrive to download the files, which he
   does. But by this time, realizing that Bennie is nearly always one step
   ahead of him, Kyle has spoken to Roy Benedict, a criminal lawyer and
   former FBI operative. He tells Roy the whole story.

   Roy still has good connections within the FBI, and they set up an
   operation to catch Bennie while Roy transfers information that is not
   sensitive. But it misfires; Bennie and his associates vanish and remain
   unidentified and unapprehended, although Kyle thinks he's working for
   some other branch of the government.

   Kyle admits his actions to the firm's partners, and agrees to leave
   their employ immediately and not practice law in New York. He also
   voices his belief that one of the firm's partners has acted as a
   'mole,' passing information to Bennie.

   Refusing the FBI's offer of witness protection, Kyle goes home to his
   father, also a lawyer, who knows the whole sorry saga and had already
   signed a deal with Elaine and her lawyer. Kyle plans to become a
   partner in his father's law firm, namely McAvoy & McAvoy. Roy, himself
   a highly paid New York lawyer, is a bit surprised at Kyle's decision:
   "The Editor of the Yale Law Journal - practicing law on Main Street in
   York, Pennsylvania?" to which Kyle answers exuberantly: "I have never
   been more serious! Real clients. Real people. Real cases. Deer hunting
   on Saturdays, Steelers on Sundays. A real life."
