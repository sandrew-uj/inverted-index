   The series followed the exploits of Jack Tenrec and his crew of
   ecological freedom fighters known as the "Mechanics". His
   often-reluctant companion is the foreign ambassador Hannah Dundee. She
   hires Jack as a liaison, while she attempts to create clear
   communication between her land and the modern civilization. Together,
   they confront the serious issues facing the futuristic environment that
   humanity has come to inhabit.

   Jack also has Hermes, a juvenile "cutter" that Jack hand-reared after
   the latter's mother's death. Gentle with Jack and Hannah, he can still
   be rather fierce when angered. The show also includes a race of
   intelligent lizards called "Griths".

   Jack and his crew square off against opposition, including the Council
   of Governors and Hammer Terhune's gang.
