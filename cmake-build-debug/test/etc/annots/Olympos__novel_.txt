   The novel centers on three main character groups; that of the scholic
   Hockenberry, Helen and Greek and Trojan warriors from the Iliad;
   Daeman, Harman, Ada and the other humans of Earth; and the moravecs,
   specifically Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io. The novel is written
   in present-tense when centered on Hockenberry's character, but features
   third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. Much like
   Simmons' Hyperion where the actual events serve as a frame, the three
   groups of characters' stories are told over the course of the novel and
   their stories do not begin to converge until the end.
