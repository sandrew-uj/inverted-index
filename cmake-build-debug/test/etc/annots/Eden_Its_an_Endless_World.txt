   Elijah and Cherubim gaze at the city in this early page from the manga.
   Endo has been noted for the amount of detail he puts into his work.

   The series begins with a long introduction, with the characters Ennoia
   and Hannah living a peaceful life on a remote and isolated island
   called Eden, with researcher Lane Morris, who is their guardian and a
   victim of the pandemic, the so-called "Closure Virus", which has killed
   15% of mankind. The events that led to this situation are revealed in
   flashbacks, leading up to the return of Ennoia's father, along with the
   forces of the Propater Federation.

   Following this, the story moves forwards twenty years, and focuses on
   Ennoia's son, Elijah, the main character, and his own conflict with the
   powerful and monopolistic Propater federation to save his sister, Mana
   Ballard, kidnapped by Propater when he was very young. She is being
   held to threaten Ennoia Ballard, father of the two characters, who has
   become a powerful drug lord in South America, feared and despised by
   many, including, to an extent, his own family. During a terrorist
   attack, Elijah, at the aged 15, is separated from his mother and his
   sister is kidnapped, along with his mother Hannah and now has to handle
   things on his own. Eden is about his coming-of-age as a man and trying
   to survive both bodily and morally in world that is too complex for
   mere "black and white". He encounters many other characters, both
   allies and enemies, all sharing the same struggle to survive in a
   post-apocalyptic dystopian world.

   Many stories are included of the people Elijah meets, telling their
   past or following life, sometimes volumes later, furthering
   understanding of the characters and giving increased depth to the world
   of the book as a whole.

   Later in the series, the story once again moves forwards in time,
   jumping four more years ahead. The Closure Virus, the cause of the
   original pandemic, mutates, this time assimilating non-organic matter
   as well as organic, known as "colloid" (or "Disclosure Virus"). The
   story rejoins Elijah, now 19 years old, as well as many other old
   characters, and some new, as the world begins to deal with this new
   threat that is swallowing many cities in the world, leaving lakes and
   craters, and many people. It is later discovered that the several
   colloids in the world, are linked with a net of underground auto-built
   "cables," and that the colloid itself, stores all the memories of the
   people it swallows.
