   The President of the United States is visiting America's most secret
   military installation, Area 7. Assigned to his protective detail is
   Shane Schofield and his team of Marines including Gunnery Sergeant Gena
   'Mother' Newman, Staff Sergeant Elizabeth 'Fox' Gant and Buck 'Book II'
   Riley Jr. They are plunged into a race for survival when an Air Force
   general, Charles "Caesar" Russell, unleashes a plan he has been working
   on for over 15 years. Despite being 'executed' on the day of the
   president's inauguration, Caesar is revived, and with a squadron of 50
   elite Air Force soldiers (the 7th Squadron), have taken control of Area
   7 and initiated a lockdown. A transmitter, attached to the president's
   heart before he was elected, has been activated; a satellite sends and
   receives messages to and from this transmitter, which is powered by the
   kinetic energy of the president's heart beating. If the satellite does
   not receive the messages from the transmitter, 14 Type-240 Blast
   Plasma-based nuclear warheads in the airports of the major cities of
   the United States will explode, destroying these cities, and making way
   for a new, racist, Confederate America. As long as the President's
   heart beats, the messages will be sent to the satellite, and the
   nuclear warheads will not detonate. To prevent the president from
   trying to escape Area 7, Caesar also overrode the launch codes on the
   Nuclear Football so that to prevent the detonation of the warheads, the
   president must place his hand on the fingerprint sensor on the Football
   (that is being kept in Caesar's possession) every 90 minutes.

   While moving through the underground complex Gant and her group,
   including the president, come to a cell block and find a scientist
   locked inside one of the cells. After being released and questioned, it
   is discovered that the prisoners being held at Area 7 are "volunteers"
   that the scientists use to carry out experiments. It soon comes to
   light that there are ways of opening exits out of Area 7, and that two
   have already been opened by another scientist, Dr Gunther Botha. In
   addition to opening two exits, Botha has also shut down main power to
   the complex, so that it is now running on auxiliary power. Meanwhile,
   Schofield and his group, after fleeing from the ground level hangar,
   make their way into the sublevels where they find a bedroom of a
   6-year-old boy named Kevin who lives in a cube. Schofield's group then
   meets up with Riley's group, and the president reveals that the reason
   for his visit to Area 7 is to check on the progress of a vaccine being
   developed for the Sinovirus, a genetically engineered virus that
   differentiates between the amount of pigmentation in a person's skin,
   allowing it to target only people of a specific race (however people of
   Asian descent are immune). The president explains that to develop a
   vaccine for the Sinovirus (and protect America from biological weapons
   containing the Sinovirus) the scientists had to create a genetically
   engineered human, a boy named Kevin, whose blood could be used to
   produce antibodies, and the prisoners being held at Area 7 are used as
   guinea pigs to test the vaccine. Botha is killed during a chase on Lake
   Powell the President and Scarecrow escape to Area 8. When they reach it
   they realize Echo unit from the 7th squadron are being paid 120 million
   American dollars by the Chinese government to bring Kevin to them.
   Schofield and the President follow onto the 747 which has a mounted
   X-38 in an attempt to rescue Kevin. Schofield hijacks the X-38,
   escaping with the president and Kevin. Later, Schofield and Gant
   finally face off with Caesar back in Area 7.
