   The Scar opens with the journey of a small ship which has set out from
   the city New Crobuzon (the setting of Perdido Street Station). It is
   heading to the city's new colony, Nova Esperium, which lies across the
   Swollen Ocean of Bas-Lag. On board the ship are:
     * Bellis Coldwine, a cold, reserved linguist who is fleeing for her
       life for her alleged connection to the events in Perdido Street
       Station.
     * Johannes Tearfly, a scientist whose interests lie in megafauna and
       underwater sealife.
     * Tanner Sack, a Remade criminal (that is, he has had his body
       surgically and magically altered as punishment for his crime) who
       is bound for slavery.
     * Shekel, a young cabin boy who befriends Tanner.

   Before the ship reaches Nova Esperium, it is captured by pirates, and
   the passengers, crew and prisoners are all press-ganged into being
   citizens of Armada, a floating city made of thousands of ships. Tanner
   uses his newfound freedom to embrace his remaking. He has his body
   further remade and the earlier, rough work perfected, becoming an
   amphibious sea-creature. Treated now as an equal citizen rather than a
   prisoner or slave, Tanner's loyalties fiercely lie in Armada.

   Bellis meanwhile despises her new life as a librarian for the city's
   vast collection of stolen books, and yearns for home. She gains the
   attention of the powerful Uther Doul, who is a bodyguard to the
   mysterious, scarred leaders of Armada known as the Lovers. Doul, for
   his own reasons, involves Bellis much more closely in the city's
   matters. She soon becomes privy to a plan formulated by the Lovers to
   raise a mythical sea creature known as the avanc. Simultaneously, she
   becomes involved with a New Crobuzonian spy named Silas Fennec, who
   reveals that the grindylow of the Cold Claw Sea are planning war on New
   Crobuzon. Silas was on his way home to warn his leaders of this war
   (thus saving the millions of innocents who might be slaughtered by the
   grindylow) when he was captured by Armada. Bellis and Silas find
   physical release in each other, and commiserate that they are powerless
   to save their home city.

   Shekel, who is learning to read with Bellis's help, finds a strange
   book in the Armada's library. He brings it to Bellis, and she realizes
   that it is the book the Lovers need to raise the avanc. Knowing that
   she must get a message home, Bellis destroys a large part of the
   Appendix which shows the equations and methods to raise the avanc.

   With the book destroyed, the Lovers seek the book's writer, Krueach
   Aum, the only person who knows how to summon the mythical creature.
   Armada mounts an expedition to his unnamed island home, which is the
   island of the dreaded Anophelii (a horrific and deadly race of
   mosquito-people). The Lovers find Aum and the information they need,
   while Bellis uses their time on the island, away from Armada, to get a
   message home warning of the impending grindylow invasion. Armada then
   successfully raises the avanc and captures it - no mean feat, as the
   avanc is an immense creature, several miles long. The Lovers' true plan
   is finally revealed: to use the great speed and pulling power of the
   avanc to find the fabled Scar, a place in the world where reality
   breaks down and anything is possible. The Lovers see this as a source
   of ultimate power.

   On the journey far into unmapped waters, numerous matters threaten the
   city. Silas Fennec's actions, which have been far from honest,
   single-handedly bring down the fury of the New Crobuzon navy and the
   inhuman wrath of the grindylows. Following this, a civil war breaks out
   within the city. Terribly damaged, Armada finally nears the Scar, and
   faces the unsettling horrors that accompany the breakdown of
   possibility. They pick up a shipwrecked friend from a different train
   of possibilities, chances and choices, who warns them of The Scar and
   that he saw the city fall into the wound of the world and everybody was
   killed. Mutiny follows and the people of Armada finally force the city
   to turn around and head back to the Swollen Ocean, the life of quiet
   and piracy, that they all want.

   The last chapter of the book is another excerpt of Bellis's letter
   home, in which she realizes how much she was being used by Doul. The
   reader is left to question how much Uther Doul actually was in control
   of the events in the book, which events were simply chance and which
   were 'planned' possibility.
