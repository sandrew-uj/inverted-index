   The narrator, 16-year-old Jeremy Grant, who has been recently orphaned,
   travels from Australia to Scotland to stay with his scientist uncle, Dr
   Lachlan McKinnon, at his estate, Inverard. He discovers that the
   irascible McKinnon and his colleagues, including Swedish Professor Lars
   Bergman, American engineer Spike Stranahan, science student Janet
   Campbell, Cockney housekeeper Madge Smith and engineer Kurt Oppenheim,
   are building an atomic-powered spaceship to travel to Hesikos, the
   wandering 'lost planet' which is now within a few days' flight of
   Earth, and which is known to have near-Earth gravity and a breathable
   atmosphere.

   It transpires that Oppenheim is a spy and saboteur working for a rival
   expedition, led by Professor Hermanoff, from an Eastern European
   country. Oppenheim is dismissed, and later Hermanoff visits Inverard to
   try and persuade the two expeditions to join forces, but there is too
   much suspicion and animosity. Oppenheim's place is taken by Grant.

   Their take-off and voyage are trouble free, but a mechanical fault
   causes a crash-landing on Hesikos, damaging the radio, and making it
   almost certain that the ship cannot take off again. Nevertheless, the
   crew start to explore the area, finding an atmosphere of peace which
   calms their anxieties and tempers. They gradually realise that much of
   the planet is covered by deep snow and ice in the winter, making all
   but plant life impossible and their own survival unlikely.

   On one trip they encounter Hermanoff and his assistant, Andrieff, whose
   spaceship has landed a few miles away. Hermanoff's personality has also
   mellowed, and he immediately offers to take McKinnon and his colleagues
   back to Earth before the imminent onset of winter. McKinnon is worried
   about overloading the spaceship, and at the last minute, unbeknown to
   the rest, he leaves the ship to return to his own, hoping to survive
   the cold until a relief expedition can be organised.

   Safely back on Earth, Grant and Campbell pick up a Morse code radio
   message from Hesikos confirming that McKinnon is alive. Within a few
   days Hermanoff and Stranahan have taken off to rescue him. The sequel
   Return to the Lost Planet continues from this point.
