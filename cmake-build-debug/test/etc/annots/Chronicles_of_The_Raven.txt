   The Raven are band of mercenaries, from the continent of Balaia, who
   are famous, with a reputation for being the best at what they do. As a
   result, they already have all the money they need and so the fights and
   missions they choose to do during the books are what they choose to do
   and not what they are paid to do - this means that they do what they
   consider to be the just and right thing to do. The Raven have been
   together ten years before the beginning of DawnThief, and have already
   lost two members named Kirst and Halyn.

   Each time a member of the Raven dies they observe their own private
   rituals, holding a Vigil and promising never to forget the dead member.
