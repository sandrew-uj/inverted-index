   Fifteen hundred years have passed since the 3,500-year reign of the God
   Emperor Leto II Atreides ended with his assassination; humanity is
   firmly on the Golden Path, Leto's plan to save humanity from
   destruction. By crushing the aspirations of humans for over three
   thousand years, Leto caused the Scattering, an explosion of humanity
   into the rest of the universe upon his death. Now, some of those who
   went out into the universe are coming back, bent on conquest. Only the
   Bene Gesserit perceive the Golden Path and are therefore faced with a
   choice: keep to their traditional role of hidden manipulators who
   quietly ease tensions and guide human progress while struggling for
   their own survival, or embrace the Golden Path and push humanity onward
   into a new future where humans are free from the threat of extinction.
