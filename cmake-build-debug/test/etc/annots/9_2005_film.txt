   9 is a sentient rag doll who appears to be the last of his kind, living
   in the ruins of a decaying, post-apocalyptic Earth. Hunting 9
   relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's
   skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman
   which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the
   mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.

   In the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor, 5, a one-eyed
   rag doll. The Cat Beast attacks the pair and consequently kills 5 by
   sucking his soul out from his mouth and 9 escapes.

   9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored
   talisman. The Cat Beast chases 9 into a building and reveals that it
   has not only taken the other rag dolls' souls, but also wears their
   numbered skins like a garment. Eventually, it falls into 9's trap and
   falls to its death.

   9 salvages the skins of the other rag dolls and prepares them to be
   ceremonially burned. As he looks sadly at the skin of 5, the two
   talismans begin to glow. 9 realizes that they are two halves of a whole
   and puts them together. A beam of green light erupts from the united
   talisman, and the spirits of the eight slain rag dolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
   6, 7 and 8 emerge, returning to their rag doll skins to be at peace.
   Before disappearing, 5's soul turns to 9 and nods in approval.

   In the morning, 9 walks off into the wasteland, leaving the empty
   talisman behind in the sand.
