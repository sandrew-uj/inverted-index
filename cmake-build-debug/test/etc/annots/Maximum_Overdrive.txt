   As the Earth crosses the tail of a comet, previously inanimate machines
   suddenly spring to life; an ATM insults a customer (King in a cameo)
   and a bascule bridge rises during heavy traffic, causing all vehicles
   upon the bridge to fall into the river or collide. Chaos sets in as
   machines of all kinds begin attacking humans worldwide. At the Dixie
   Boy Truck Stop just outside Wilmington, North Carolina, employee Duncan
   Keller is blinded after a gas dispenser sprays diesel in his eyes. An
   electric knife injures waitress Wanda June, and arcade machines in the
   back room electrocute a customer. Cook and paroled ex-convict Bill
   Robinson begins to suspect something is wrong. Meanwhile, at a Little
   League game, a vending machine kills the coach by firing canned soda
   point-blank at him. A driverless roller compactor flattens one of the
   fleeing children, but Duncan's son Deke manages to escape on his bike.

   Newlyweds Connie and Curt stop at a gas station, where a brown tow
   truck tries to kill Curt, but he and Connie escape in their car. Deke
   rides through his town as humans and even pets are brutally killed by
   lawnmowers, chainsaws, electric hair dryers, pocket radios, RC cars and
   an ice cream truck. At the Dixie Boy, a black Western Star 4800
   sporting a giant Green Goblin mask on its grille runs over bible
   salesman Camp Loman after a red garbage truck kills Duncan. Later,
   several big rig trucks encircle the truck stop.

   Meanwhile, a truck pursues Connie and Curt, but they make it crash off
   the side of the road as it explodes. They arrive at the truck stop and
   try to pass between the trucks, but their car is hit and overturns.
   Bill and Brett Graham, a hitchhiker, rush to help them, but the trucks
   attack them. The owner Bubba Hendershot uses M72 LAW rockets he had
   stored in a bunker hidden under the diner to destroy many of the
   trucks. Deke makes it to the truck stop later that evening and tries to
   enter via the sewers, but is obstructed by the wire mesh covering the
   opening. That night, the survivors hear Loman screaming in a ditch, and
   Bill and Curt sneak out to help him by climbing through the sewers.
   Deke finds Loman and believes he is dead, but he suddenly jumps up and
   attacks Deke. Bill and Curt rescue Deke, and a truck chases them back
   into the pipe.

   The next morning, a Caterpillar D7G bulldozer and an M274 Mule drive to
   the truck stop (the former pushes Hendershot's Cadillac inside). The
   angered Hendershot uses the rocket launcher to blow up the bulldozer,
   but the Mule fires its post-mounted M60 machine gun into the building,
   killing several people, including Hendershot and Wanda. The Mule then
   demands, via sending morse code signals through its horn that Deke
   deciphers, that the humans pump the trucks' diesel for them in exchange
   for their lives. The survivors soon realize their own machines have
   enslaved them. Bill suggests they escape to a local island just off the
   coast, on which no motorized vehicles are permitted. While the crew is
   resting, Bill theorizes that the comet is actually a "broom" operated
   by interstellar aliens that are using our machines to destroy humanity
   so the aliens can repopulate the Earth. During a fueling operation,
   Bill sneaks a grenade onto the Mule vehicle, destroying it, then leads
   the party out of the diner via a sewer hatch to the main road just as
   the trucks demolish the entire truck stop. The Green Goblin truck
   pursues the survivors to the docks, managing to kill trucker Brad when
   he falls behind. After Bill destroys the truck with a direct hit from
   an M72 LAW rocket shot, the survivors then sail off to safety. A title
   card epilogue explains that two days later, a UFO was destroyed by a
   Soviet "weather satellite" conveniently equipped with class IV nuclear
   missiles and a laser cannon. Six days later, the Earth passes out of
   the comet's tail, and the survivors are still alive.
