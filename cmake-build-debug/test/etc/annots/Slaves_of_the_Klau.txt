   Roy Barch is a young Earth man who is the son of a scientist. His
   dreams of following his father's profession have been ended by the
   arrival on Earth of a benevolent alien race, the Lekthwan, which is far
   more advanced than humans. The Lekthwan pass on enough of their
   advanced science that many Earth scientists find that their knowledge
   has become obsolete, including Roy, who becomes a servant for a
   Lekthwan. One day, the alien's wife and two daughters arrive on Earth
   in a spaceship. The 20-year-old daughter, who Roy calls Ellen, is a
   cultural anthropologist and scientist. Roy asks her out on a date to
   hear a jazz band.

   When they arrive home, her family has been killed by huge aliens from
   the Klau race, who kidnap Roy and Ellen. The pair are transported to
   Magarak, a grim, dank Klau mining and manufacturing planet to work as
   slaves. Ellen is resigned to her fate, and says escape is impossible,
   but Roy insists that he will escape and get back to Earth. They escape
   to the wilderness, where they meet a tribe of other fugitive slaves led
   by a towering Klau named Clet. Every week, Klau and their Podruods (a
   subspecies of Klau used as warriors and fighters) come on flying rafts
   to hunt slave fugitives for sport. Roy suggests to Clet that the tribe
   fight back against the Klau hunters, but Clet wants to continue the
   statu quo.

   Roy leaves the tribe's cave, intending to become an exile. While he is
   in the woods, he spots a flying raft of Klau hunters coming towards the
   cave. He shoots the Klau and takes their alien rifles, which he uses to
   kill Clet (who Roy believes will never agree to fight the Klau). Roy
   announces he is the new leader of the tribe and tells them that they
   can escape from Magarak. While many dismiss his plan as hopeless, Roy
   argues that if they steal flying barges, they may be able to jury-rig
   an airtight enclosure and fly through space. He leads raiding
   expeditions to steal barges and equipment and they weld two barges face
   to face and mount life-supporters inside. As their raids continue, Roy
   realizes that the Klau will likely soon strike back. He mines the bluff
   overlooking the cave mouth with explosives and has a third barge filled
   with high explosives.

   When the Klau attack, they fly to the bluff, and Roy triggers the
   explosions. Roy orders the tribe to make the final preparations on
   their improvised space vessel, and then he sets out to take the
   explosives-filled air barge to the command and control center of the
   Klau on Magarek. Roy destroys it the Klau headquarters and returns to
   the cave. However, the tribe has left, including Ellen, and the
   improvised spaceship is gone. After a period, another air barge arrives
   filled with new fugitive slaves. Roy leads the creation of a second
   improvised spaceship, and they get back to Earth. He is hailed as a
   hero in the war against the Klau slavers. He goes to see Ellen again,
   and she asks him to marry her. At first he refuses, on the grounds that
   they are too different, and he fears that her advanced alien race looks
   down on humans. In the end he decides to take a risk and marry her.
