   Maia, youngest and least-favored son of the Emperor of the Elflands and
   of mixed Elven and Goblin heritage, unexpectedly ascends to the throne
   after his father and half-brothers are killed in an airship crash.
   Having been brought up entirely in exile from the court, living with an
   abusive cousin, the court is alien to him and his lack of social polish
   and connections make it difficult to take up his new responsibilities.

   In the course of the first few months of his reign, Maia agrees to
   marry the noblewoman Csethiro; is seized by a crush on the opera singer
   Vechin; is visited by his maternal grandfather, the ruler of the
   Goblins; and slowly comes to terms with the loss of privacy that comes
   with being accompanied by bodyguards and retainers at all times. He
   survives an attempted coup by his half-brother's widow and his lord
   chancellor because his young nephew Idra refuses to usurp the throne,
   and his investigation into the death of his father uncovers a
   conspiracy by disaffected noblemen that had been using a group of
   worker revolutionaries to kill the previous Emperor.

   The end of the novel sees Maia survive an assassination attempt by the
   conspiracy's ringleader, and push through a controversial project to
   bridge the realm's principal river. An epithet accorded to him by a
   courtier, "the bridgebuilder", represents his efforts to connect
   emotionally with the people surrounding him slowly coming to fruition.
