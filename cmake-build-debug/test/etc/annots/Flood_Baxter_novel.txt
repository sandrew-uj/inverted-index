   The above effects are catastrophic, and exceed current estimates of
   climate change-related sea level rise. In the opening chapter, four
   main characters (former USAF Captain Lily Brooke, British military
   officer Piers Michaelmas, English tourist Helen Gray, and NASA
   scientist Gary Boyle) are liberated by a private megacorporation called
   AxysCorp from a Christian extremist Catalan terrorist bunker in
   Barcelona in 2016, after five years of captivity. AxysCorp was hoping
   to save a fifth prisoner, John Foreshaw, but he was executed minutes
   before the rescue. Nonetheless, the corporation continues to look after
   the four hostages and search for Helen's daughter, Grace, who was
   conceived in captivity by the son of a Saudi royal and taken by his
   family. Helen befriends Foreign Office official Michael Thurley in the
   hopes of finding her daughter, and the four rescued hostages make a
   pact to keep in contact.

   At this point, sea level changes have already submerged Tuvalu, a low
   lying South Pacific island, whose inhabitants have been evacuated to
   New Zealand. London and Sydney are prone to constant flooding. However,
   as a tidal surge hits London and Sydney, killing hundreds of thousands
   in both cities, scientists become aware that this cannot be explained
   solely by the consequences of climate change. American oceanographer
   Thandie Jones uncovers the truth - through deep sea diving missions to
   oceanic ridges and trenches reveal that the seabed has fragmented, and
   there is turbulence that can only be attributable to the infusion of
   vast subterranean reservoirs of hitherto hypothesised but undetected
   oceanic masses of water (see below).

   Over the next three decades, ocean waters rise exponentially and
   inundate the whole world, as the main characters struggle for survival
   in a vast and continuously altering environment. Lily and her sister
   Amanda, as well as her children Benj and Kristie experience the
   flooding and abandonment of London. Amanda and her children settle into
   a refugee resettlement in Dartmoor, but the rising floodwaters make
   that only a temporary respite. In 2019, a tsunami obliterates western
   coastal cities in the United Kingdom, killing Helen Gray and tens of
   thousands of others. At the same time, New York City is demolished by
   an Atlantic tidal wave (with hundreds of thousands killed in New York
   and the city levelled in the process), and Washington, D.C. is
   evacuated. For the next twenty years, Denver, Colorado becomes the
   capital of the steadily diminishing United States, which fragments as
   individual states assert their own survival needs.

   By 2020, much of the eastern coast of the United States is underwater,
   as well as Sacramento, California, on its western coast. AxysCorp CEO
   Nathan Lammockson, the man who ordered the main characters' rescue and
   indirect friend of Lily, has a contingency plan for survival of an
   affluent western minority, which involves evacuation to the mountainous
   Peruvian Andes. Lily, Amanda with her children, and Piers tag along to
   the settlement, where Nathan discloses that he is aware of the extent
   of global inundation, which will not stop until all land on Earth is
   submerged, apart from the Greenland and eastern Antarctica ice sheets.
   As the United States is eroded away, a contingent of refugees which
   includes Gary, Thandie, and Grace, heads south to meet Lily. When they
   reach Nathan's 'Project City' in Peru, they are swept up in a revolt
   that tries to seize control of the former elite settlement which
   results in the deaths of Amanda, Benj, and Kristie's husband, Ollantay,
   a self-claimed Inca descendant who leads the revolt. Gary parts ways
   with Lily as he hands over Grace, so they, along with Piers and Kristie
   board Nathan's "Ark Three", a Queen Mary sized (and shaped) ocean
   vessel that sets sail in 2035. By then, little of Western Europe,
   Russia, the Americas, Oceania, and Africa remain above the water.

   Ark Three sails the global ocean in search for trading and finding
   higher ground, despite running into skirmishes with pirates that lead
   to Lily falling overboard and staying on a submarine with Thandie for a
   year, the survivors head for Tibet. However, when they arrive, Nepal's
   Maoist rulers have devastating news - Tibet is ruled by a Khmer
   Rouge-like regime that practices human slavery and cannibalism. Ark
   Three heads back out to sea but has nowhere to go, given that the
   floods are now lapping around the Rocky Mountains. Seaborn piracy is
   rife from those refugee seaborn populations who have taken to
   scavenging the refuse from the posthumous remains of human
   civilization; and after a visit to coastal Colorado, the pirates
   ultimately board and destroy Ark Three. By this time, over five billion
   people have perished from the floods.

   By 2048, the Andes, Rocky Mountains and elsewhere have been submerged.
   Tibet's regime is no more, and Australia, North America, South America,
   Africa, and most of Asia except for the highest mountains in the
   Himalayas have been flooded. As Lily, Gary, and Thandie settle into
   life as sea-dwelling survivors; Piers, Nathan, and Kirstie die in
   staggered succession since the sinking of Ark Three. The novel ends in
   2052, as a group of survivors watch the submergence of the peak of
   Mount Everest. Lily has survived, and wonders what the grandchildren of
   her late-sister's family and her old hostage comrades from three
   decades ago will make of post-deluge Earth, now at a new environmental
   equilibrium, with a vast global storm system that is reminiscent of
   those on Jupiter and Neptune.

   Civilization is virtually dead at the novel's end. Survivors continue
   to exist only on the rafts and some decrepit surviving former navy
   vessels. The children of the rafts, raised on the water, start building
   their own aquatic culture. By the end of the novel, extinction seems
   certain for humanity on Earth. However, we learn later in the book that
   Ark Three (the aforementioned ocean liner) was one of many projects
   created by AxysCorp and a few other groups. One of these (Ark One) was
   a starship project, which was taken over by the remnant government of
   the United States, and launched as Denver flooded in 2041; and at that
   time earlier in the novel, Lily had managed to get Grace aboard it just
   before it launched, and at the time she was unwillingly pregnant with
   the child of Nathan's snobbish and estranged son, Hammond. In 2044, a
   lunar eclipse occurs, just as a massive burst of light is sighted near
   Jupiter and the survivors realise it must be Ark One, and Grace's
   survival is thus ensured.

   As they prepare to leave the former site of Mount Everest Lily realizes
   something. She sailed on Ark Three, and Ark One is a starship. In
   closing, she asks "What is Ark Two?" The question ends the novel, and
   sets the scene for Baxter's sequel, Ark, in which it is resolved.
