   The action takes place in Battle Hill, outside London,^[1] amidst the
   townspeople's staging of a new play by Peter Stanhope. The hill seems
   to reside at the crux of time, as characters from the past appear, and
   perhaps at a doorway to the beyond, as characters are alternately
   summoned Heavenwards or descend into Hell.

   Pauline Anstruther, the heroine of the novel, lives in fear of meeting
   her own doppelgaenger, which has appeared to her throughout her life.
   But Stanhope, in an action central to the author's own theology, takes
   the burden of her fears upon himself--Williams called this the Doctrine
   of Substituted Love--and enables Pauline, at long last, to face her
   true self. Williams drew this idea from the biblical verse, "Ye shall
   bear one another's burdens"^[2]

   And so, Stanhope does take the weight, with no surreptitious motive, in
   the most affecting scene in the novel, and Pauline, liberated, is able
   to accept truth.

   On the other hand, Lawrence Wentworth, a local historian, finding his
   desire for Adela Hunt to be unrequited, falls in love instead with a
   spirit form of Adela, which seems to represent a kind of extreme
   self-love on his part. As he isolates himself more and more with this
   insubstantial figure, and dreams of descending a silver rope into a
   dark pit, Wentworth begins the descent into Hell.
