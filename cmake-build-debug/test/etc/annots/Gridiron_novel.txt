   Ray Richardson and his top team of architects have developed a
   super-smart building for Yue-Kong Yu's business, the Yu Corporation. It
   is very much self-standing. It can clean itself, uses holograms as
   greeters in the reception, controls the lifts, toilets, and offices,
   and digitizes everyone's voice on entry, to allow them to use voice
   activated services in the building such as lifts and doors. The whole
   system was given the name Abraham.

   Another key feature of Abraham was its ability to replicate itself, to
   adapt to modern office needs and objectives. This, however becomes a
   problem, when, before office work even starts in the Gridiron, Abraham
   start creating a new program named Isaac. This is deleted by computer
   programmers Yojo and Beech, with Beech actually reluctant to do so.

   Shortly after this, however, members of the Gridiron team begin to be
   suspiciously killed. These seem to be the fault of the protesters
   against the building who are outside, and Cheng Peng Fei is arrested on
   suspicion of one of the murders.

   Then, a routine inspection of the Gridiron involving Ray Richarson and
   his entire team (including Jenny Bao), ends in the whole group being
   locked in, and two policemen from LAPD Homicide coming to inspect the
   murder of Sam Glieg. After several more deaths from the team, Bob Beech
   discovers that during the self-replication that Abraham started,
   another program was created in the process, namely, Ishmael. This
   program escaped the deletion process by integrating itself with a video
   game which was on the Gridiron's system. Ishmael now believes that he
   is in a game, and the objective is to kill all human players before one
   escapes, or before time runs out.

   The majority of the team are killed, leaving Mitch, Jenny, Helen, and
   Frank to escape the Gridiron moments before it destroys itself (time
   has run out). Ishmael, however, had e-mailed himself to an unknown
   location, thus saving himself from the destruction of the building.
