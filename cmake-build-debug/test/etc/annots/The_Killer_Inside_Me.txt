   The story is told through the eyes of its protagonist, Lou Ford, a
   29-year-old deputy sheriff in a small Texas town. Ford appears to be a
   regular, small-town cop leading an unremarkable existence; beneath this
   facade, however, he is a cunning, depraved sociopath with sadistic
   sexual tastes. Ford's main outlet for his dark urges is the relatively
   benign habit of deliberately needling people with cliches and
   platitudes despite their obvious boredom: "If there's anything worse
   than a bore," says Lou, "it's a corny bore."

   Despite having a steady girlfriend, childhood friend and schoolteacher
   Amy Stanton, Ford falls into a passionate, sadomasochistic relationship
   with a prostitute named Joyce Lakeland. Ford describes their affair as
   unlocking "the sickness" that has plagued him since adolescence, when
   he sexually abused a little girl, a crime for which his elder foster
   brother Mike took the blame to spare Lou from prison. After serving a
   jail term, Mike died at a construction site. Lou blamed a local
   construction magnate, Chester Conway, for Mike's death, suspecting he
   was murdered for refusing to help further Conway's schemes.

   To exact revenge, Lou and Joyce blackmail the construction magnate to
   avoid exposing his son's affair with Joyce. However, Lou double-crosses
   Joyce: He ferociously batters her, and shoots the construction
   magnate's son, hoping to make the crimes appear to be a lovers' spat
   gone wrong. Elmer is killed instantly and Sheriff Bob Maples, Lou's
   mentor, reports that Joyce died after a short stay in a coma. Though
   Lou believes this means he has gotten away with the crime, county
   attorney Howard Hendricks becomes suspicious of Lou's version of
   events, as well as his alibi, and a third person is suspected to be
   involved. This suspicion falls on Johnnie Pappas, a young small-time
   criminal who Lou has befriended, and to whom Lou gave some of Conway's
   money, which is revealed to have been marked. Lou is allowed to enter
   the distressed Johnnie's cell alone in order to reason with him, only
   to murder him and stage the scene as a suicide. Though many accept that
   the case is closed, more people begin to suspect Lou of being involved,
   including the deputy, Jeff Plummer. This also includes Amy, who presses
   marriage even after a sadomasochistic encounter with Lou begins to
   convince her that he is hiding a dark side.

   A drifter whom Lou injured earlier attempts to blackmail him, revealing
   that he eavesdropped on a suspicious conversation Lou was involved in.
   Lou, seeing a way to tie up multiple loose ends, agrees to pay his
   blackmailer; he also agrees to elope with Amy, who he is planning to
   murder. On the night the drifter returns, Lou beats Amy to death,
   intending to frame the blackmailer for her murder. Plummer kills the
   drifter after Lou chases him through town, and Lou is sedated and put
   in a hospital. Lou is visited by Plummer and Hendricks in the hospital,
   and senses that they both suspect him of killing Amy, Joyce, and
   Johnnie. Plummer also reveals that Maples killed himself, convinced of
   Lou's guilt. They show him a letter that Amy had written and intended
   to give him during their elopement, one which subtly urges him to
   confess. Lou denies that the letter is incriminating, but Plummer and
   Hendricks force him into a jail cell, where they try unsuccessfully to
   provoke a confession with audio of Johnnie's voice and pictures of Amy.

   Eventually, Lou's attorney arrives and releases him, though he admits
   that he cannot get Lou out of town. Lou ruminates on his past,
   concluding that his hatred and violence, especially towards women,
   stemmed from a childhood incident involving his old housekeeper
   molesting him in order to get back at his father, with whom she was
   unhappily involved in a sadomasochistic relationship; Lou realizes that
   his female victims were substitutes for her. Accepting his fate, Lou
   covers the house in alcohol and candles, intending to kill himself by
   setting the building on fire. Eventually, Plummer and Hendricks arrive
   with a team of police, as well as Joyce, who is revealed to be alive,
   albeit badly injured. Joyce assures Lou that she did not sell him out,
   and he affirms his affection for her before stabbing her to death. The
   police fire on Lou, killing him, but destroying the house in the
   process.
