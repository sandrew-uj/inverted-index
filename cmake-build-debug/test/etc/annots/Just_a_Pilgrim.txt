   The setting of the series is one in which the Sun experienced coronal
   expansion (referred to as 'The Burn') growing to the point where the
   Earth was scorched and the oceans evaporated, and only a few pockets of
   humanity have survived. The first series is narrated by Billy Shepard,
   a child who is with a refugee group attempting to cross the now empty
   Atlantic Basin, in hopes of finding sources of water on the other side.
