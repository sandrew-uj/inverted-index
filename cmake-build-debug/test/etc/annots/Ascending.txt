   The novel opens with "A Word About Oar", a brief recap of the earlier
   story. At the end of Expendable, Festina left the apparently deceased
   Oar lying in one of the Towers of Ancestors on her planet, where her
   people absorb high-energy radiations that sustain their lives. At the
   start of Ascending, Oar regains consciousness in the tower where
   Festina left her, to find that she is being accosted by a diminutive
   and odd-looking orange being. This is Uclodda Unorr, a professional
   smuggler who has been hired to gather evidence on past misdeeds of the
   Technocracy's Outward Fleet--and who is surprised to discover that Oar
   is alive. He informs her that four years have passed since Festina left
   Melaquin, which makes the year 2456 A.D. Unorr has been sent to gather
   evidence before representatives of the Outward Fleet can arrive to
   destroy or conceal it; thanks to Festina's activities, a scandal has
   erupted that will expose the corruption of the High Council of Admirals
   (events recounted in Gardner's Hunted). Unorr and Oar find it in their
   interest to escape the planet forthwith; but as they and Unorr's large
   and muscular (but demur) wife Lajooli are leaving in a bioneural
   spacecraft, they are confronted by the Shaddill, who have come to use
   Oar's corpse in an experiment and are also surprised that she is alive.

   The little party of Oar, Unorr, and Lajooli manage to escape from the
   Shaddill for the present; and so they find themselves fleeing across
   space from both the Shaddill and the Outward Fleet. In the process, Oar
   is contacted mentally by a very strange alien being who calls himself
   the Pollisand; he, or it, has a form resembling a headless white
   rhinoceros, but seems to be one of the very advanced and cryptic
   galactic beings who exist far above the mundane material level. The
   Pollisand claims responsibility for Oar's recovery from death; and it,
   or he, enlists Oar's help in a grand plan to destroy the Shaddill. Oar
   lets her animus outweigh her suspicion, and agrees to work with him.

   Fortunately, Admiral Ramos is also rushing to Melaquin to prevent the
   destruction of evidence; Oar and friends detect her approach and race
   to the Admiral's ship to escape the pursuing Shaddill. They sacrifice
   their own ship to incapacitate the Shaddill's enormous vessel (though
   only temporarily), and are rescued by the humans. Festina is astonished
   to find that Oar is "alive and causing trouble again".

   Trouble, however, approaches from all sides. The Outward Fleet has been
   deeply corrupted from the top down, and Festina's ship is soon
   sabotaged by a rather incompetent saboteur. Indeed, it becomes clear
   that the human society of New Earth, which calls itself the
   Technocracy, is rife with incompetence and corruption on all
   levels--part of a pattern of degeneracy that is afflicting other
   societies helped by the Shaddill, societies that have grown
   increasingly "decadent, temperamental, and culturally sterile", and
   filled with "wicked, arrogant, self-centered" individuals.

   Festina tries to rescue the situation by contacting an eccentric and
   unpleasant species called the Cashlings; but before her plan can
   succeed, humans and Cashlings, Oar and Uclod and all are captured by
   the technologically overwhelming Shaddill. Human and Melaquin
   resourcefulness, however, manage to outwit and outmaneuver the enemy;
   Oar and Festina learn the secrets behind the Shaddill's malicious
   manipulation of humanity and other species. Oar triumphs over her
   adversaries, and also fulfills her bargain with the Pollisand, who in
   turn presents her with a remedy for the "Tired Brain" syndrome that
   leaves her people comatose in the Towers of Ancestors. With a new
   maturity of her own, she brings the cure back to Melaquin, becoming
   something very close to the savior of her people. Festina is more than
   a little amazed at the change in her old friend, back from the dead.
