   Life looks good for Becky Bloomwood. She has a great relationship with
   boyfriend Luke as well as a steady job giving financial advice on
   television. Furthermore, she is on good terms with her bank manager,
   Derek Smeath. Life becomes problematic for Becky when Mr. Smeath
   retires from Endwich Bank and Luke announces he wants to make it big in
   New York, big changes are in store for Becky. She takes to New York
   like an angel to heaven. Becky has never been happier and the reader is
   treated to Becky seeing the Guggenheim in a unique way, winning the
   attention of employees at Barney's and discovering sample sales. Becky
   spends a substantial amount of money, but is sure she's financially
   secure, with the job offers on T.V. piling up. She also justifies her
   expenses by convincing herself that the items are an investment in the
   future.

   An article in the Daily World reveals her high debts, calls her a fraud
   for telling people how to manage their money when she is herself
   feckless. This causes a fight between her and Luke, as there are
   current rumours about that his PR company, Brandon Communications, will
   lose Bank of London as their client, and her being revealed as in debt
   (and Luke not even knowing about it) doesn't help situations. More and
   more opportunities are ruled out, when more and more people read the
   article. She even loses her current job on Morning Coffee, and is
   replaced by her former co-worker Clare Edwards, who Becky never liked,
   being boring and smug. She returns home to her roommate and best friend
   Suze, while Luke remains in New York, and their relationship comes to
   an apparent end.

   Becky and Suze go to Becky's new bank manager to ask for a bigger
   overdraft, but are met with nothing but hostility and disgust. A woman
   who worked for her former employers Morning Coffee contacts her and
   asks her to lunch, Becky becomes hopeful, but it turns out she only
   wants her to come on and be told off by Clare for TV. She becomes
   depressed and Suze tries to comfort her. On a trip to Luke's office to
   collect a package for her delivered there, Becky decides that she will
   see Mel, Luke's secretary, for a bit because she missed her. She
   collects her package, but also notices how quiet it is with no moral.
   She hides in Mel's desk just in time so no one catches her in the
   office. During that time, she overhears Alicia's conversation with her
   fiance, Ben Bridges, and another Brandon C. worker, which confuses her.
   Becky discovers she, along with her colleagues and Bridges, are
   planning to steal Luke's clients, along with Bank of London, and run
   the company out of business to embarrass Luke. She waits for them to
   leave, which they do after a few tense minutes and she safely leaves
   Brandon C.

   Instead of going home to Suze and tell her about what she had
   witnessed, Becky decides to do a little detective work and find out
   more about Alicia's plans. She heads down to King Street and ask a
   tenant about any new businesses coming into the street. He tells Becky
   the empty 2nd floor of the building he owns, will be the future home of
   a financial public relations business called "Bridges and Billington"
   and the Bank of London will be one of their future clients. Furious at
   Alicia's actions for what she did to Luke as well as herself, Becky
   thanks the tenant for his help and leave for home. After returning
   home, she immediately contacts Luke's colleague in America, Michael
   Ellis, and tells him the truth about what she had seen. He thanks her
   for informing him, but Becky requests that Michael does not tell him
   that it was her. When asked about her reasons against it, Becky admits
   that she's concerned that Luke will think she's spreading rumors by
   gossiping behind his back to prove a point after a remark she made
   about Elinor. Michael agrees to cover for her by telling Luke that he
   found out from an anonymous tip and will look into it.

   The next day, Suze suggests for a healing and empowering exercise that
   Becky throw out all her unnecessary possessions. She was against it at
   first, but later agrees when she saw how cluttered her room is and
   needed something to take her mind off of losing her job and Alicia's
   plans. While trying to tidy up, Becky comes up with a better idea after
   watching an art sale auction on TV. When Suze and Tarquin comes in to
   her room, Becky tells them the great idea that she had in mind. She has
   decided to sell off all her unnecessary possessions in a sales auction
   to make a lot of money. To her surprise and relief, Suze and Tarquin
   are on board to helping her advertise the sale. During that time, Becky
   gets a call from Michael, who invites her to lunch at the Savoy Hotel.

   At the Savoy Hotel, he congratulates her for helping them out because
   her information saved Brandon C. from being run out of business by
   exposing Alicia and her colleagues for trying to ruin the company's
   reputation with their clients. Michael reveals that Luke has returned
   to London to try and salvage his company's reputation with his clients
   while trying to keep interest open in America. He also mentions that
   because of Alicia's fiance's wealth, Ben was a key player in her plans
   and he was able to finance the project that they've been working on for
   some time. They were planning to steal all of Brandon C.'s clients and
   set up business elsewhere in King Street. As soon as Luke left with
   Becky for New York, she and her colleagues got to work immediately by
   telling their co-workers and clients a bunch of rumours that he will
   close the UK branch. As a result, clients are threatening to sue him
   and workers were leaving earlier, all the while she was telling him a
   different story. Once Michael told Luke the truth, he immediately
   returned to the UK branch of Brandon C. to search their desks and found
   plenty of evidence. Furious, he took Alicia and her colleagues by
   surprise in the meeting room and he fired them for it. Michael mentions
   that Luke plans to press charges of embezzlement against Alicia, Ben
   and four others involved in their scheme. Noticing that Becky has no
   job and is in debt, he offers her a job in Washington D.C. and can help
   her with immigration as he's got a good lawyer and friends in
   immigration to convince them. Michael also offers her good advice in
   finding work that she's real passionate about and not fall into a job
   she doesn't like.

   That night, Becky holds an auction for her clothes and items. She sells
   all of it, even her Denny and George scarf, a big symbol for her and
   Luke's relationship, which makes more than three times her money back
   to pay off her debts. Becky accepts the slot on Morning Coffee, but
   shocks them all by telling them she has no more financial problems, has
   paid of all her debt, and is heading off to New York now to work at
   Barneys as a personal shopper (all of which is now true). Her former
   co-workers beg her to stay and answer questions from people on the
   phone wanting to know how she got out of debt. Becky refuses and heads
   to the airport with her travelling luggage ready to head to New York.
   Though unable to get an upgrade, the clerk was able to get her a window
   seat near the emergency exit with plenty of leg room. Becky comes
   across an article from the Financial Times, detailing Luke's risky
   business plans to save his company. Though feeling bad for him, she
   also accepts the fact it's over between them and she must move on with
   her own life.

   Luke turns up at the airport and tells Becky that Michael told him all
   about what she did for his company. He thanks her, although Luke admits
   he was angry about it because she should have told him. Becky defends
   herself by stating she was worried that Luke wouldn't believe her if
   she came to him about Alicia and would think she was gossiping behind
   his back. Thus, she thought telling Michael about Alicia's plans was a
   safer bet since he would not betray her. While having a drink at the
   airport bar, Luke revealed that he confronted the reporter from Daily
   World that wrote the bad article about Becky to reveal her source and
   was enraged when he found out Alicia was involved. After returning to
   London, Luke did extensive search in her desk and had found bank
   statements that belonged to Becky. This revelation makes her feel bad
   for leaving her bank statements behind, unaware of the trouble it and
   the excessive shopping caused her. However, Luke reveals that he was
   Alicia's real target and she was a mere stepping stone. He admits he
   realized his mistake in accusing Becky for ruining his deal and
   apologizes after learning Alicia ruined her T.V. career intentionally
   so she had an easier shot at embarrassing him by ruining Brandon C's
   reputation with their clients and running it out of business. She tells
   Luke that it was also her own fault, because if she had been keeping
   tabs on her money and not gone shopping excessively in New York, she
   wouldn't have put herself in the mess she was in. In a lot of ways,
   Becky was glad she read the article because she realized she had to
   grow up and start paying back her debts. Luke begs her to stay, to come
   and work at Brandon Communications. He also reveals how much Alicia
   decimated his staff, including firing his trustworthy secretary, Mel,
   when she suspected Alicia and a few others for lying to him. Becky
   refuses and tells Luke that she doesn't want to settle down at a job
   she doesn't want, as she's too young for that. When he asks her reasons
   against it and starts to believe she has taken up Michael's offer to
   live in Washington DC, Becky reveals her intent to return to New York
   to work at Barneys as a personal shopper. She also admits that she
   didn't take Michael's offer and that he was being a good friend in
   giving her good advice in finding a job she is passionate in working
   at. Realizing this, Luke apologizes to Becky again for his assumption.
   Before she leaves, Luke gives Becky back her Denny and George scarf,
   revealing that the two bidders pitting against each other were him.
   Becky leaves for New York to accept a job at Barneys.

   Some time later, Becky is working as a personal shopper at Barneys in
   New York. She has regular TV appearances representing fashion styles,
   which gains her more than three times her viewers back. Becky is
   helping out a female customer to accessorise an outfit, when Luke shows
   up as a customer. Becky soon realizes she really missed him and they
   get back together.
