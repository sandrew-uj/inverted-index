   Aremis Slake lives in a room underground in the subway station Grand
   Central - 42nd Street. It soon becomes the home he has never known. He
   collects used newspapers off passing trains and makes a living selling
   them. He has two regular customers: the cleaning lady, and a man with a
   turban. A major theme throughout the book is Slake's low self-esteem
   and lack of experiences with empathy, which are dealt with throughout
   the course of the book.

   With the money that he gets from doing this, he buys food from the
   local diner, and soon becomes a regular customer. The people at the
   luncheonette see him there every day and have sympathy for this
   homeless boy. They offer him a sweeping job and pay him with food
   sufficient to meet his needs. Also, whatever he finds on the floor he
   gets to keep, so Slake eventually has quite a collection of various
   items he's organized and used to decorate his cave.

   There are also occasionally sections of the book entitled "On Another
   Track", about the parallel life of a man named Willis Joe Whinny.

   Willis Joe is a middle-class motor man who also has an internal
   dilemma. He conducts trains with the depressing mindset that people are
   like sheep, lacking the empathy essential for psychological health.

   At the climax of the book, Willis Joe meets Slake and their paths
   coincide due to a railway accident that was thought to have been caused
   by holes in the subway walls. Terrified, Slake scrambles on the subway
   track because he has pneumonia and needs help, because his home was
   doomed to be sealed up due to repairs needed in the subway. He
   scrambles onto the track with a sign that says STOP and Willis Joe
   saves him, stopping the train with a determination he had not
   experienced for years.

   When Slake awakes in a hospital, he decides to flee for the rooftops.
   He sees his symbolic bird fly away, ending a miserable period in his
   life and signifying depression. He then departs with renewed hopes and
   purposes.
