   A reflective statue is found at the bottom of one of Earth's oceans,
   having lain there for 1.5 billion years. Since humans have recently
   developed a time-slowing field and found that one such field cannot
   function within another, it is suspected that the "Sea Statue" is
   actually a space traveler within one of these time fields. Larry
   Greenberg, a telepath, agrees to participate in an experiment: a
   time-slowing field is generated around both Greenberg and the statue,
   shutting off the stasis field and revealing Kzanol. Kzanol is a living
   Thrint, a member of a telepathic race that once ruled the galaxy
   through the Power (mind control).

   Eons ago, Kzanol's spaceship had suffered a catastrophic failure; its
   reactive drive system failed and the navigation computer automatically
   jettisoned it. Faced with insufficient power to use hyperspace, Kzanol
   aimed his ship at the nearest uninhabited Thrint planet used to grow
   yeast for food (Earth), and turned his spacesuit's emergency stasis
   field on to survive the long journey and impact. He also arranged for
   his ship to change course for the system's eighth planet (Neptune)
   after he was in stasis, with his amplifier helmet and other valuables
   stashed inside his spare suit (in order to hide these valuables from
   any rescuers).

   Although he assumed that the resident Thrint overseer would be able to
   rescue him after seeing the plume of gas created by his impact, his
   timing could not have been worse; while he was in stasis, the races
   enslaved by the Thrint revolted. Facing extinction, the Thrint decided
   to take their enemies with them by constructing a telepathic amplifier
   powerful enough to command all sentient species in the galaxy to commit
   suicide. (Only the artificially created Bandersnatchi survived, having
   been secretly designed to be resistant to the Power.) After hundreds of
   millions of years, the yeast food mutated and evolved into complex life
   on Earth.

   The telepathic encounter with the Thrint left the confused Greenberg
   with two sets of memories, his own and Kzanol's. He instinctively
   assumed he was Kzanol, the much more powerful telepath. Both Greenberg
   and the real Kzanol stole spaceships and raced to reclaim the
   thought-amplifying machine on Neptune, which was powerful enough to
   enable a single Thrint to control every thinking being in the Solar
   System. The chase led to Pluto, which had been a moon of Neptune before
   it was knocked into its own orbit by the impact of Kzanol's ship.
   Eventually, Greenberg's personality reasserted itself and, armed with
   the knowledge of how to resist the Power (from Kzanol's own memories),
   Greenberg trapped Kzanol again in a stasis field.

   A major element of the story was the Cold War existing between Earth
   and the "Belters", which threatened to burst into a highly destructive
   war over control of the telepathic amplifier. The mutually accepted
   compromise was to throw the spacesuit containing the dangerous device,
   still in a stasis field, onto Jupiter, where no one could recover it.
