   Revelation Space begins with three seemingly-unrelated narrative
   strands that merge as the novel progresses. This plot structure is
   characteristic of many of Reynolds's works.

   The first strand centres around Dan Sylveste, beginning in the year
   2551. Sylveste is an archaeologist excavating the remains of the
   long-dead Amarantin race. Over the course of decades, Sylveste learns
   that the Amarantin may have become technologically sophisticated before
   their sun destroyed life on the planet Resurgam nearly a million years
   prior.

   The next strand centres around Ilia Volyova aboard the Nostalgia for
   Infinity, a large ship capable of interstellar travel. Volyova and the
   other members of her skeleton crew wish to find Sylveste because they
   believe he can help them with their captain, who has been infected with
   the Melding Plague, a nanotech virus that attacks human cells and
   machine implants to pervert them into grotesque combinations.

   The third strand focuses on Ana Khouri, an assassin living on the
   planet Yellowstone (in the Epsilon Eridani system). Khouri is hired by
   a mysterious figure known as the Mademoiselle to assassinate Sylveste.

   With help from the Mademoiselle, Khouri infiltrates the crew of the
   Nostalgia for Infinity as it reaches orbit around Yellowstone, knowing
   that they will then travel to Resurgam. The Nostalgia for Infinity
   arrives in orbit around Resurgam in 2566. Desperate to secure
   Sylveste's expertise to help cure her captain, Volyova and the other
   two members of the ship's ruling triumvirate (Sajaki and Hegazi)
   threaten the defenceless Resurgam civilisation, prompting its rulers to
   turn Sylveste over to them.

   Once aboard, however, Sylveste informs the triumvirs that he has
   antimatter bombs hidden inside the implants in his artificial eyes that
   could destroy the Nostalgia for Infinity. He then agrees to attempt to
   cure their captain in exchange for a trip to Cerberus, a mysterious
   nearby planet that he believes holds the secret to the truth of
   Amarantin civilisation. They soon discover that Cerberus is actually a
   massive beacon aimed at alerting a machine sentience of the appearance
   of new star-faring cultures so that it can destroy them. It is that
   sentience, Sylveste belatedly realises, that caused the demise of the
   Amarantin.
