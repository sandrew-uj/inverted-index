   The opening of the game shows the New York City skyline in 2002 and
   depicts it being attacked by a mysterious force. The main game is set
   in the futuristic year of 2004, when Earth has been enslaved by a race
   of aliens known as the Orbs. The Orbs, who look like giant floating
   eyeballs, have implanted all humans with global tracking devices,
   forced them to wear nondescript robes, and forbidden them from speaking
   or communicating. The protagonist has been assigned by the Orbs to
   track down fellow humans who are believed to be forming an underground
   resistance. Over the course of the game, the player discovers that the
   Orbs are not the benevolent rulers they claim to be; they are actually
   harvesting humans as a food source. The player then "switches sides"
   and works to overthrow the Orbs. The player works against Phil, the
   antagonist, who is murdering members of the resistance. The game ends
   with the player flying an Orb ship and bombing various locations in
   Manhattan, before Phil escapes, chased by the player.

   The ending sets up the game for a sequel, Manhunter: San Francisco.
