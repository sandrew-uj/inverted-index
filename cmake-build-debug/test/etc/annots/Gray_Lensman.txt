   The action in Gray Lensman picks up immediately where Galactic Patrol
   left off, in the middle of the battle to destroy Helmuth's Main Base
   and, it is hoped, fully end the threat of Boskone. After the base
   falls, Kinnison finds some clues that lead him to think that Helmuth
   was perhaps not the head of Boskone after all. The clues lead Kinnison
   to mount an expedition aboard the newly constructed super-dreadnought
   Dauntless, into the Second Galaxy where he thinks the true head of
   Boskone might reside. The Dauntless locates a planet under attack and
   comes to its aid, destroying the Boskonian forces and discovering that
   the entire planet is capable of going "free" (that is, inertialess, the
   method used in the Lensman books to achieve interstellar and
   intergalactic space travel). The Lensman returns to the First Galaxy
   with the space-faring planet and its grateful residents.

   Kinnison decides that since the Patrol is not yet strong enough to
   attack the Second Galaxy militarily, he will follow leads to the upper
   levels of Boskone through the traffic in the illegal drug thionite.

   The novel then follows Kinnison as he tries to infiltrate the Boskonian
   drug network. Along the way, Kinnison learns something else new: as a
   Second Stage Lensman he no longer needs his Lens to do Lensman things
   such as read minds or communicate telepathically, although he works
   better while wearing it. Kinnison suffers some setbacks, and has to
   assume different identities, eventually one requiring him to drink and
   use drugs. Even though he tries to drink while actually letting the
   people around him empty the bottles, and uses the least harmful drug he
   can, it still takes him a while to get over their effects. Eventually
   he uncovers the information he was looking for: the name and the
   location of Jalte, the boss of all Boskonian drug traffic in the First
   Galaxy.

   There is a minor interlude in which the Delgonian Overlords seem to
   have returned. Because he had fought the Overlords before, Kinnison is
   asked to lead the expedition to hunt them down, and the reptilian
   Worsel comes along. The Delgonians are dispatched in fairly short
   order, but only after the loss of many good men. Kinnison agonizes over
   the casualties that they suffered because, although he and Worsel were
   mentally strong enough to resist the Overlords, his men were not.

   Realizing that the Patrol will need new and much more powerful weapons
   before it can take on Boskone in the Second Galaxy, Kinnison convenes
   50 of the greatest scientists in the galaxy to work on new
   weapon-development projects. The weapon they invent, whose theory
   requires the development of a wholly new mathematics, is called a
   "negasphere", composed of something combining the attributes of
   antimatter and negative matter. It totally consumes absolutely anything
   it touches, in mutual annihilation. They plan to make a negasphere of
   planetary dimensions and use it against the leaders of Boskone.

   Kinnison infiltrates Jalte's base and gets the information he had been
   hoping for since his trip to the Second Galaxy: the location of the
   leaders of Boskone, a group made up of members of a race called the
   Eich. He and Worsel set out on what amounts to an almost suicide
   mission to infiltrate Jarnevon, the homeworld of the Eich. Kinnison is
   captured and tortured. Unknown to the Eich, Worsel is hiding close by
   and finds a way to rescue Kinnison, and they get away. Infected by
   something that requires the Patrol doctors to amputate all four limbs,
   blinded, and tortured almost to death, Kinnison is nonetheless saved,
   but he will most likely be a basket case.

   Earlier in the book, a Posenian physician called "Phillips" was
   financed by the Patrol to try to develop a way to allow higher beings
   to regenerate body parts in the same way that lower animals (starfish,
   flatworms, salamanders, etc.) can. When Kinnison was injured, Phillips
   was ready to try his procedure on humans. It works and Kinnison is
   brought back to full health. During his convalescence Clarissa
   MacDougall is again his nurse, and their love grows stronger.

   He then leads an expedition to destroy Jalte's base, using the
   negasphere. He continues to the Boskonian home ground in the Second
   Galaxy, to destroy their fleet and then the Eich's home base using a
   "nutcracker"--a pair of planets with diametrically opposed velocities,
   released to crush Jarnevon between them. And so pass the Eich and the
   Council of Boskone. It is thought that finally the long struggle is
   finished and Civilization is triumphant.

   Kinnison and MacDougall make plans to get married and the book ends
   with them walking off, hand in hand, into a bright and happy future.
