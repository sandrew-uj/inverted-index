   After society was almost destroyed in a robot rebellion in 2033, the
   remnants are either slaves to the Dark One in the one city that remains
   or nomads in the outside world. Slaves either work to power the city or
   fight in death matches for the other slaves to watch and for the Dark
   One's entertainment. While the winner of these matches is promised a
   reward, they receive death instead. The games are used to weed out of
   the population the biggest and the strongest to prevent rebellion in
   New Terra, the last city on Earth.

   Just outside New Terra (New York City), Neo, a drifter from the
   atomic-blasted wastelands and his klutzy robot sidekick arrive at a
   factory where slaves labor to fuel the Dark One's Power Station. He
   meets Deeja (Nadine Hart), who convinces him to help rescue her father.
   Her father is a scientist (Michael Dowend) who has invented a device
   that can break the Dark One's control over the factory slaves.
   Gathering a motley crew of allies on the way, Neo and Deeja go to the
   Power Station to confront the Dark One's evil servants. They find her
   father's body has been forcibly linked to the Dark One and was beyond
   saving, forcing Neo to kill both the Dark One and Deeja's father. With
   the Dark One dead and the slaves are free, Deeja stays behind to
   continue her father's work while Neo returns to the wastelands with his
   robot sidekick.
