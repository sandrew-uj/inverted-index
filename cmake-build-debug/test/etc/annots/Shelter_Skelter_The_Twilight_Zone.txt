   Harry Dobbs is a family man obsessed with surviving a nuclear war, and
   he has even built himself a fallout shelter in his basement. One
   afternoon, his wife Sally makes plans to visit her sister in Kansas
   City and to take their two kids with her. Harry and their son Jason are
   downstairs in the shelter teaching him to shoot a gun when Sally
   decides to leave. Harry and Sally argue about her leaving and him
   teaching a seven-year-old to shoot. He becomes frantic when he thinks
   Sally might have revealed the shelter's existence to her sister, as he
   wants it to remain secret.

   Nick, who runs Harry's gun and ammo store, comes by that evening and
   talks about the escalating tension in the Middle East. He is afraid
   that it could lead to nuclear war. They learn from the news that the
   President has left the White House to stay in an undisclosed location.
   Harry then talks about how he wishes the bomb would come so the world
   could be rid of pimps, cowards, rock stars, hair-dressers and
   bureaucrats (i.e. the scum of the world according to Harry). He talks
   about how he and his son would start over in a "purified" world
   (somehow leaving out his wife and daughter). While drunk, Harry reveals
   the existence of his shelter to Nick and shows him the whole operation
   while mentioning that nobody knows about it. Harry also shows Nick the
   fallout shelter's communications which includes a hydraulic system that
   can raise and lower an antenna through tons of rubble, so he could
   tentatively communicate with other survivors after a nuclear attack.

   Harry then turns on his communication system and raises its antenna
   while turning on the TV. On the news, Harry and Nick learn that World
   War III could be imminent. Harry frantically tries to get Sally to come
   home but she refuses saying that Harry "cries wolf" far too often.
   Without warning, a massive explosion occurs and Harry runs back to the
   shelter with Nick and shuts the door. The blast, however, destroys the
   raised antenna cutting off all information about what is happening
   outside. Believing that a nuclear weapon has hit the local air force
   base and that World War III has begun, Harry and Nick believe they are
   the only ones left alive.

   Six weeks later, Nick hears something moving above and Harry surmises
   it to be the walking dead or scavengers. Nick tries to get whatever is
   moving above to come down into the shelter and Harry goes ballistic.
   After ten months, the radiation has not gone down at all and Nick is
   going stir crazy. Harry decides to kill him but Nick leaves the
   shelter. After a while, Nick returns to tell Harry of what it is like
   outside. Everything is gone, there is no more daylight and it is
   freezing outside. Harry refuses to let Nick back in as he is afraid
   he'll contaminate him. Sometime after Nick dies, Harry's paranoia gets
   worse, and he prepares for battle in the event of outsiders attacking.

   Things are quite different from what Nick and Harry believed as the
   explosion was not a nuclear attack, but the result of a Broken Arrow
   incident in which a bomb accidentally detonated at the local Air Force
   base destroying the entire town. The accident actually shocked the
   world from the brink of war. The blast crater has been contained under
   a radiation proof dome memorial - The Peace Dome - which has sealed the
   debris and radiation inside of it and proved to the world the folly of
   war. The memorial was built on top of the Dobbs' house.

   The episode ends when Sally and the kids place flowers on the memorial.
   Jason asks Sally if that's where his daddy is buried. She says, "Yes
   dear, that's where Daddy is buried," and smiles, as if she knows he's
   essentially buried alive.
