   Sam Spade is a private detective in San Francisco, in partnership with
   Miles Archer. The beautiful "Miss Wonderley" hires them to follow Floyd
   Thursby, who has run off with her sister. Archer takes the first stint
   but is found shot dead that night. Thursby is also killed later and
   Spade is a suspect. The next morning, Spade coolly tells his office
   secretary, Effie Perine, to have the office door repainted to read
   simply "Samuel Spade".

   "Miss Wonderley" is soon revealed to be an acquisitive adventuress
   named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who is involved in the search for a black
   statuette of unknown but substantial value. Others are after this
   falcon, including Joel Cairo, an effeminate Levantine homosexual, and
   Casper Gutman, a fat man accompanied by a vicious young gunman, Wilmer
   Cook. O'Shaughnessy begs for Spade's protection while telling him as
   little as possible. They meet with Cairo at Spade's apartment, and
   Spade again presses O'Shaughnessy for details; again she stalls but
   kisses Spade. The next morning, she is asleep in his bed. Leaving her
   there, Spade slips out to search her apartment.

   Effie believes O'Shaughnessy "is all right" and Spade should help her.
   Effie agrees to hide her at her own home, but O'Shaughnessy disappears
   again. When Spade meets Gutman in his hotel room, neither will tell
   what he knows. Spade implies he is looking out for himself, not
   O'Shaughnessy. Red herrings abound. The police suspect Spade in the
   shootings: he was bedding Archer's wife, Iva. The District Attorney
   ties the shootings to Dixie Monahan, a Chicago gambler who had employed
   Thursby as a bodyguard in the Far East.

   At a second meeting, Gutman tells Spade the history of the falcon. It
   was made of gold and jewels by the 16th-century Knights of Malta as a
   gift to the King of Spain but was captured by pirates. After passing
   from owner to owner, at some time it was coated with black enamel to
   conceal its value. Gutman traced the falcon to General Kemidov, a
   Russian exile in Constantinople and hired O'Shaughnessy to get it; she
   brought in Cairo to help. O'Shaughnessy and Thursby fled with the
   falcon to Hong Kong and from there to San Francisco. During this
   conversation, Gutman drugs Spade, who passes out on the floor.

   Spade awakens alone and returns to his office where a wounded ship's
   captain staggers in with a package containing the falcon and dies.
   O'Shaughnessy calls the office, begs for Spade's help, but sends him on
   a wild goose chase. When he returns, O'Shaughnessy is waiting in front
   of Spade's apartment building. Inside Spade's apartment they find
   Gutman, Wilmer, and Cairo in wait with guns drawn. Gutman presents
   $10,000 in cash for the falcon, but Spade argues that the police must
   arrest someone for the murders. During a fight, Spade knocks Wilmer
   out, and Gutman agrees to give Wilmer to the police.

   Spade has Effie fetch the falcon. But Gutman discovers it is a fake (a
   decoy made by General Kemidov). During the excitement, Wilmer escapes.
   Gutman decides to go to Constantinople for the real falcon; Cairo joins
   him and they leave. Spade then calls the police and tells them the
   story, adding that he has Wilmer's guns and other evidence. While they
   are waiting, he bullies O'Shaughnessy into confessing her real role.

   Archer was shot with Thursby's gun, but by her. She has lied to him and
   double-crossed him. O'Shaughnessy admits all this, but pleads that she
   is in love with Spade. Maybe he does care for her, Spade admits, but "I
   won't play the sap for you" - for personal as well as professional
   reasons. If she can get off with a long prison term, he'll wait for
   her; but if she hangs, so be it. When the police arrive, he turns her
   in, and the police tell him Wilmer has just shot Gutman dead.
