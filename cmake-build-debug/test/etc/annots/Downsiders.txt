   The Downsiders are a secret community of an unknown population (either
   native-born or "fallers" from the topside) dwelling underneath New York
   City. They are a proud, noble community who get by on giving new life
   to things and people thrown away by the Topsiders (the surface people).
   Downsiders are not allowed to travel to the surface, and every contact
   with Topsiders is strictly forbidden, since it is said that it would
   lead to the fall of the Downside. Talon, a fourteen-year-old Downsider,
   is curious about the Topside; he travels to the Topside and meets a
   fourteen-year-old girl named Lindsay Matthias, who just moved from
   Texas to live in NY with her father after her mother went to Africa
   with her professor for three years to study the white rhino. After a
   rocky beginning, they become interested in each other and eventually
   fall in love. However, when Talon brings Lindsay to the Downside, the
   Wise Advisors (a circle of corrupted people serving as the government
   for the Downsiders, since there has not been a proper leader for ages)
   find out Talon's transgression and sentence him to death by sending him
   down the pipe system. Talon survives; he winds up on Coney Island
   "under the boardwalk," and has the time of his life, experiencing the
   "strange Topside rituals" for the first time.

   Meanwhile, the construction workers who work under Lindstay's father
   (an engineer who aims to build a new, massive aqueduct for the
   residents of New York) end up finding traces of some mysterious people
   dwelling underside the city, and the Topsiders become aware of the
   Downsiders and want to catch them. As Talon heads for the Downside, the
   Downsiders meet at the city hall ("Hall of Action") and plan to take
   action against the Topsiders. Railborn Skinner, Talon's former friend
   and the person who ratted Talon out, suggests knocking out the
   Topside's utilities to punish them for their "ungratefulness." Talon
   comes back and tells the Downsiders, who thought he was dead, about
   what he saw in the Topside; when the Wise Advisors ask Railborn what to
   do, Railborn orders for Talon to be sent to the Chamber of Soft Walls
   (the Downside mental ward).

   In the midst of the events, the Topside's utilities are knocked out
   (which include electricity, gas and water). However, rather than
   panicking, the New Yorkers decide to party instead, and the mayor
   passes an order that the utilities be shut down once per year in a
   celebration known as "The Festival of Outages". Meanwhile, Lindsay, who
   has become curious about the Downsiders, searches for info about the
   Downside's origin, and eventually finds that the Downside was created
   over 100 years ago by an eccentric engineer named Alfred Ely Beach, who
   faked his death and sook refuge to the Downside along with his
   supporters after being chased away by the corrupt mayor of NY. Lindsay
   sneaks into the Downside and gives the information to Talon, hoping
   that it may bring peace with the Topside. At first, Talon is angry at
   this information; he soon, however, realizes what to do. He demands to
   the guard to be released and travels to the Chamber of First Runes,
   where only a Most-Beloved (the true Downside's leader) is allowed in.
   In the secret room, Talon sees the grave of the late Alfred Ely Beach,
   the forgotten creator of the Downside and the first Most-Beloved, and
   after having a "conversation" with him, he leaves, deciding what to do
   with his people. At the same time, a large piece of rock impales Gutta,
   and leaves her severely wounded. Railborn carries Gutta to a hospital
   on the Topside, and they are both labelled wards of the state. At the
   hospital, Railborn does a ritual swearing he would cut all ties with
   the Downside. Once Gutta is healed, the both of them are sent to an
   orphanage where they begin a new life as people of the Topside.

   Meanwhile, on the surface, Mark, Lindsay's father, is being blamed for
   the outages. The city orders his resignation, and he signs the
   resignation papers after rekindling his strained relation with Lindsay.
   As the two share the moment, an explosion is heard and felt. The
   explosion is actually half of the Downside, which was destroyed, and
   sealed up as a result, in a plan by Talon to keep the Topsiders out.
   The plan works, and Talon, who is now Most-Beloved, later returns to
   the Chamber of First Runes and leaves Lindsay's information at Beach's
   grave, deciding not to divulge the true origin of the Downside; he sees
   Beach's journal there, and though as tempting as it is to read it,
   Talon leaves it. Upon exiting the chamber, Talon tells the guards to
   never let anyone (himself included) in until a new Most-Beloved arises.

   Talon and Lindsay meet up again months later. Talon takes Lindsay to
   the top of an abandoned skyscraper; Downsiders are now living atop
   them, and this area is called the Highside. Talon tells Lindsay that
   once the Downsiders know what all the Topsiders know and are on equal
   ground with them, they will reveal themselves to the world, but until
   then, they have to be left alone. As such, Talon and Lindsay must cease
   to see each other; they spend their last moments together by gazing at
   a beautiful sunset.
