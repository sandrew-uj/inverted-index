   The novel begins as John Jasper leaves a London opium den. The next
   evening, Edwin Drood visits Jasper, who is the choirmaster at
   Cloisterham Cathedral and also his uncle. Edwin confides that he has
   misgivings about his betrothal to Rosa Bud, which had been previously
   arranged by their respective fathers. The next day, Edwin visits Rosa
   at the Nuns' House, the boarding school where she lives. They quarrel
   good-naturedly, which they apparently do frequently during his visits.
   Meanwhile, Jasper, having an interest in the cathedral crypt, seeks the
   company of Durdles, a man who knows more about the crypt than anyone
   else.

   Neville Landless and his twin sister Helena are sent to Cloisterham for
   their education. Neville will study with the minor canon Rev.
   Crisparkle; Helena will live at the Nuns' House with Rosa. Neville
   confides to Rev. Crisparkle that he had hated his cruel stepfather,
   while Rosa confides to Helena that she loathes and fears her
   music-master, Jasper. Neville is immediately smitten with Rosa and is
   indignant that Edwin prizes his betrothal lightly. Edwin provokes him
   and he reacts violently, giving Jasper the opportunity to spread
   rumours about Neville's having a violent temper. Rev. Crisparkle tries
   to reconcile Edwin and Neville, who agrees to apologise to Edwin if the
   former will forgive him. It is arranged that they will dine together
   for this purpose on Christmas Eve at Jasper's home.

   Rosa's guardian, Mr. Grewgious, tells her that she has a substantial
   inheritance from her father. When she asks whether there would be any
   forfeiture if she did not marry Edwin, he replies that there would be
   none on either side. Back at his office in London, Mr. Grewgious gives
   Edwin a ring which Rosa's father had given to her mother, with the
   proviso that Edwin must either give the ring to Rosa as a sign of his
   irrevocable commitment to her or return it to Mr. Grewgious. Mr.
   Bazzard, Mr. Grewgious's clerk, witnesses this transaction.

   Next day, Rosa and Edwin amicably agree to end their betrothal. They
   decide to ask Mr. Grewgious to break the news to Jasper, and Edwin
   intends to return the ring to Mr. Grewgious. Meanwhile, Durdles takes
   Jasper into the cathedral crypt. On the way there Durdles points out a
   mound of quicklime. Jasper provides a bottle of wine to Durdles. The
   wine is mysteriously potent and Durdles soon loses consciousness; while
   unconscious he dreams that Jasper goes off by himself in the crypt. As
   they return from the crypt, they encounter a boy called Deputy, and
   Jasper, thinking he was spying on them, takes him by the throat - but,
   seeing that this will strangle him, lets him go.

   On Christmas Eve, Neville buys himself a heavy walking stick; he plans
   to spend his Christmas break hiking around the countryside. Meanwhile,
   Edwin visits a jeweller to repair his pocket watch; it is mentioned
   that the only pieces of jewellery that he wears are the watch and chain
   and a shirt pin. By chance he meets a woman who is an opium user from
   London. She asks Drood's Christian name and he replies that it is
   "Edwin"; she says he is fortunate it is not "Ned," for "Ned" is in
   great danger. He thinks nothing of this, for the only person who calls
   him "Ned" is Jasper. Meanwhile, Jasper buys himself a black scarf of
   strong silk, which is not seen again during the course of the novel.
   The reconciliation dinner is successful and at midnight, Drood and
   Neville Landless leave together to go down to the river and look at a
   wind storm that rages that night.

   The next morning Edwin is missing and Jasper spreads suspicion that
   Neville has killed him. Neville leaves early in the morning for his
   hike; the townspeople overtake him and forcibly bring him back to the
   city. Rev. Crisparkle keeps Neville out of jail by taking
   responsibility for him, stating that he will produce Neville anytime
   his presence is required. That night, Jasper is grief-stricken when Mr.
   Grewgious informs him that Edwin and Rosa had ended their betrothal; he
   reacts more strongly to this news than to the prospect that Edwin may
   be dead. The next morning, Rev. Crisparkle goes to the river weir and
   finds Edwin's watch and chain and shirt pin.

   A half-year later, Neville is living in London near Mr. Grewgious's
   office. Lieutenant Tartar introduces himself and offers to share his
   garden with Landless; Lt. Tartar's chambers are adjacent to Neville's
   above a common courtyard. A white-haired and -whiskered stranger
   calling himself Dick Datchery arrives in Cloisterham. He rents a room
   below Jasper and observes the comings and goings in the area. On his
   way to the lodging the first time, Mr. Datchery asks directions from
   Deputy. Deputy will not go near there for fear that Jasper will choke
   him again.

   Jasper visits Rosa at the Nuns' House and professes his love for her.
   She rejects him but he persists, telling her that if she gives him no
   hope he will destroy Neville, the brother of her dear friend Helena. In
   fear of Jasper, Rosa goes to Mr. Grewgious in London.

   The next day Rev. Crisparkle follows Rosa to London. When he is with
   Mr. Grewgious and Rosa, Lt. Tartar calls and asks if he remembers him.
   Rev. Crisparkle does remember him as the one who years before saved him
   from drowning. They do not dare let Rosa contact Neville and Helena
   directly, for fear that Jasper may be watching Neville, but Mr. Tartar
   allows Rosa to visit his chambers to contact Helena above the
   courtyard. Mr. Grewgious arranges for Rosa to rent a place from Mrs.
   Billickin and for Miss Twinkleton to live with her there so that she
   can live there respectably.

   Jasper visits the London opium den again for the first time since
   Edwin's disappearance. When he leaves at dawn, the woman who runs the
   opium den follows him. She vows to herself that she will not lose his
   trail again as she did after his last visit. This time, she follows him
   all the way to his home in Cloisterham; outside she meets Datchery, who
   tells her Jasper's name and that he will sing the next morning in the
   cathedral service. On inquiry, Datchery learns she is called "Princess
   Puffer." The next morning she attends the service and shakes her fists
   at Jasper from behind a pillar.

   Dickens's death leaves the rest of the story unknown. According to his
   friend and biographer John Forster, after Dickens had written him two
   brief letters which relate to the plot (but not the murder), he had
   supplied Forster with an outline of the full plot:

     His first fancy for the tale was expressed in a letter in the middle
     of July. "What should you think of the idea of a story beginning in
     this way?--Two people, boy and girl, or very young, going apart from
     one another, pledged to be married after many years--at the end of
     the book. The interest to arise out of the tracing of their separate
     ways, and the impossibility of telling what will be done with that
     impending fate." This was laid aside; but it left a marked trace on
     the story as afterwards designed, in the position of Edwin Drood and
     his betrothed. I first heard of the later design in a letter dated
     "Friday the 6th of August 1869", in which after speaking, with the
     usual unstinted praise he bestowed always on what moved him in
     others, of a little tale he had received for his journal, he spoke
     of the change that had occurred to him for the new tale by himself.
     "I laid aside the fancy I told you of, and have a very curious and
     new idea for my new story. Not a communicable idea (or the interest
     of the book would be gone), but a very strong one, though difficult
     to work." The story, I learnt immediately afterward, was to be that
     of the murder of a nephew by his uncle; the originality of which was
     to consist in the review of the murderer's career by himself at the
     close, when its temptations were to be dwelt upon as if, not he the
     culprit, but some other man, were the tempted. The last chapters
     were to be written in the condemned cell, to which his wickedness,
     all elaborately elicited from him as if told of another, had brought
     him. Discovery by the murderer of the utter needlessness of the
     murder for its object, was to follow hard upon commission of the
     deed; but all discovery of the murderer was to be baffled till
     towards the close, when, by means of a gold ring which had resisted
     the corrosive effects of the lime into which he had thrown the body,
     not only the person murdered was to be identified but the locality
     of the crime and the man who committed it. So much was told to me
     before any of the book was written; and it will be recollected that
     the ring, taken by Drood to be given to his betrothed only if their
     engagement went on, was brought away with him from their last
     interview. Rosa was to marry Tartar, and Crisparkle the sister of
     Landless, who was himself, I think, to have perished in assisting
     Tartar finally to unmask and seize the murderer.
