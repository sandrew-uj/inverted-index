   Underlying the Basin and Range province of North America, giant
   caverns, some many miles in diameter, form a network that is occupied
   by people who have evolved the adaptations (such as pale skin) for
   living underground. Completely isolated from the upper world, the
   people have created a civilization that is technologically more
   advanced than that of 1935 America.
