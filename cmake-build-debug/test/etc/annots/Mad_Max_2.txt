   Following a global war and the collapse of civilization after oil
   supplies were nearly exhausted, the world is in a state of barbarism.
   Haunted by the death of his family, former policeman Max Rockatansky
   now roams the desert wilderness of a post-apocalyptic Australia in a
   scarred, black, supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special. Scavenging for food
   and petrol, Max's only companion is an Australian Cattle Dog. After
   driving off a gang led by the unhinged biker warrior Wez, and taking
   petrol from one of their wrecked vehicles, Max finds an apparently
   abandoned gyrocopter and decides to collect its fuel, but is ambushed
   by the pilot. Max manages to overpower him and spares his life in
   return for being led to an oil refinery that the pilot has discovered.
   When they arrive, Max finds the compound under siege by the Marauders,
   a motley gang of drivers and motorcyclists of which Wez is a member.
   The Marauders' leader, a large masked man called "Lord Humungus", has
   his gang attacking the complex daily, believing that the compound
   contains fuel reserves.

   Biding his time, Max sees an opportunity when several groups of the
   settlers attempt to break out of the besieged compound and are chased
   down by the Marauders. Max rescues the single survivor of one group and
   strikes a deal to return him to the complex in exchange for fuel. The
   man dies from his wounds shortly after Max takes him back, and the
   settlers' leader Papagallo reneges on the deal. The settlers are on the
   verge of killing Max when the Marauders return. Although Wez wants to
   kill all the settlers after his partner is killed by a metal boomerang
   thrown by a feral child living within the complex, Humungus offers the
   settlers safe passage in exchange for the fuel supply.

   Max offers an alternative deal to Papagallo: he will procure a vehicle
   to haul the settler's tanker if they return his car and give him as
   much fuel as he can carry. The settlers accept, but keep his car until
   he returns. That night, carrying fuel for the truck, Max sneaks out on
   foot with the Feral Kid's help. He again encounters the Gyro Captain
   and forces him to carry the fuel to the truck, a Mack semi which Max
   discovered after his initial encounter with Wez. With aerial support
   from the Gyro Captain, Max drives the semi through the Marauders'
   encampment into the compound. Though the settlers want Max to escape
   with them to the far North, Max opts to collect his fuel and car and
   leave. However, while attempting to break through the siege, Max is
   seriously injured when his car is wrecked after being run off the road
   by Wez in Lord Humungus's nitrous oxide-equipped vehicle. One of the
   Marauders kills Max's dog with a crossbow and is about to kill Max when
   Toady's attempt to siphon the fuel from the Pursuit Special's tanks
   triggers the car to self-destruct; both Marauders are killed in the
   explosion. Max is left for dead, but the Gyro Captain rescues him and
   flies him back to the compound.

   Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired and now
   armored truck with the fuel tanker. He leaves the compound, accompanied
   by the Feral Kid with Papagallo and several of the settlers in armored
   vehicles to provide protection. Lord Humungus and most of his warriors
   pursue the tanker, leaving the remaining settlers free to flee the
   compound in a ramshackle bus, rigging the compound to explode. After
   Papagallo and the defenders are killed during the chase, and the Gyro
   Captain shot down, Max and the Feral Kid find themselves alone against
   the Marauders as Wez boards the truck to kill the two of them.

   However, the semi's head-on collision with Humungus' car kills both him
   and Wez as the out-of-control truck rolls off the road while the
   surviving Marauders leave. As the injured Max carries the Feral Kid
   from the wrecked tanker, he sees not oil, but sand, leaking from the
   tank, revealing it to be a decoy which allowed the other settlers to
   escape with the fuel in oil drums hidden inside their vehicles. With
   Papagallo dead, the Gyro Captain succeeds him as their chief and leads
   the settlers to the coast, where they establish the "Great Northern
   Tribe". The Feral Kid (as an adult and the Northern Tribe's new leader)
   is revealed as the film's narrator, reminiscing about the Road Warrior,
   who departed for parts unknown, and now lives on only in legend.
