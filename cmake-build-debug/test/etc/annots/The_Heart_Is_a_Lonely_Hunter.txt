   The book begins with a focus on the relationship between two close
   friends, John Singer and Spiros Antonapoulos, deaf-mutes who have lived
   together for several years. Antonapoulos becomes mentally ill,
   misbehaves, and despite attempts at intervention from Singer, is
   eventually put into an insane asylum away from town. Now alone, Singer
   moves into a new room.

   The remainder of the narrative centers on the struggles of four of John
   Singer's acquaintances: Mick Kelly, a tomboyish girl who loves music
   and dreams of buying a piano; Jake Blount, an alcoholic labor agitator;
   Biff Brannon, the observant owner of a diner; and Dr. Benedict Mady
   Copeland, an idealistic physician.
