   The story is told out of chronological order.

   Aqib, a distant relative of the royal family of Olorum, is the
   assistant keeper of the royal Menagerie. He meets Lucrio, an ambassador
   from the Daluc,an kingdom. An attraction develops between then, despite
   an Olorumi prohibition against same-sex relationships. Ten days later,
   Lucrio boards a ship to return to his homeland with his new Olorumi
   wife. Aqib attempts to swim out to the ship, but is dragged back to
   shore by his brother, the Corporal.

   Aqib and Lucrio make love on the night after they meet; they continue
   to have nightly trysts for the duration of Lucrio's stay. Three days
   after Lucrio leaves, the princess Femysade chooses Aqib as her husband;
   they marry and have a daughter, Lucretia. Aqib is summoned to a meeting
   with two Olorumi deities, who grant him the ability to communicate with
   animals. Femysade leaves her family to live with the gods.

   In the Royal Menagerie, Lucrio asks Aqib to leave Olorum with him. Torn
   between love for Lucrio and loyalty to his family and religion, Aqib
   declines. Later that night, he regrets this choice and attempts to
   leave, but is prevented by his father and the Corporal. Due to
   Femysade's jealousy, the gods erase all memories of Lucrio from Aqib's
   mind. At the age of 89, Aqib dies.

   It is revealed that Aqib actually chose to leave the Menagerie with
   Lucrio. For decades, he wondered if he had made the correct choice.
   Once per lifetime, a Sibylline Oracle allows supplicants to ask for one
   miracle. The Oracle offered Aqib the chance to live another life as if
   he had stayed in Olorum. In return for this vision, Aqib dips his hand
   into a jar of honey, and the Oracle consumes it. Aqib realizes that he
   made the correct choice. Despite the fact that Lucretia does not exist,
   he and Lucrio have made their own family in Daluz. Aqib realizes that
   he can now understand the language of animals, just as he did in his
   vision of another life.^[4]
