   Caith mac Sliabhin, condemned by the Sidhe in "The Brothers" for
   committing patricide, wanders along the river Guagach, accompanied and
   tormented by Dubhain, a mischievous pooka. Their journey takes them to
   Gleann Fiain where a beast from the river chases Caith up a hill to an
   isolated cottage. The occupants, twins Ceannann and Firinne, let Caith
   and Dubhain in and allow them to spend the night. Unbeknown to Caith,
   the birth of the twins 21 years ago set in motion a sequence of events
   that damned Gleann Fiain and cast a shadow over Faery.

   The twins were born to Fianna, queen of Gleann Fiain in Dun Glas. But
   unbeknown to her husband, Ceannann mac Ceannann, Fianna was unable to
   conceive and had sought help from a wise-women, Moragacht. Moragacht
   struck a bargain with her, promising her twins if she lay down with a
   selkie, in exchange for one of the twins when they were born. But when
   the twins arrived (a human and a selkie) and Moragacht came to claim
   one of them, Fianna denied any knowledge of her, and mac Ceannann
   turned Moragacht away. From that day onwards, grief and misery struck
   the family, and mac Ceannann and Fianna were forced to vacate Dun Glas
   and flee with the twins to an abandoned hilltop fortress. But the loch
   beast, under Moragacht's control, found them there and killed them all,
   except the twins, now aged 14, who escaped to the cottage. The witch
   then seized control of Dun Glas from where she damned all of Gleann
   Fiain.

   But the wards that had protected the cottage from Moragacht fall when
   Caith and Dubhain arrive. Riders from Dun Glas come and capture the
   twins. Caith and Dubhain (as a horse) give chase, but as they approach
   the riders, Dubhain is overcome by the witch's magic and falls into the
   loch, abandoning Caith. Caith and the twins are taken to Dun Glas where
   they are locked in cells bordering the loch. Caith lapses into a dream
   where he enters the loch to find Dubhain duelling with the loch beast.
   He draws Dubhain back to his cell, who in turn calls Nuallan from
   Faery, the bright Sidhe controlling their destinies. Nuallan gives
   Caith a silver key to unlock the iron cells and so lifts a spell
   enabling Nuallan to cast Caith, Dubhain and the twins out of Dun Glas.
   Moragacht allows her prisoners to escape because with her magic she now
   holds Nuallan, a bigger catch and her means to controlling Faery.

   The twins lead Caith and Dubhain to the ruins of the hilltop fortress,
   their former home. There they make a fire with the remains of a
   staircase, but a ghost appears out of the smoke that transports Caith
   back to the night of the fall of the fortress and into the body of
   Padraic, head of mac Ceannann's household. There he relives the last
   few hours of the family until he is killed by the beast. Firinne
   retrieves one of the burning timbers from the fire as a keepsake, and
   the twins set off for the sea to search for their selkie father, with
   Caith and Dubhain in pursuit. Caith finds the selkie first, a whale
   floundering on the beach. But when the selkie shapeshifts to a man, he
   is killed by one of Moragacht's pursuing riders. In the ensuing
   confusion, Caith accidentally kills Ceannann. Firinne is devastated by
   the loss of her twin brother and gives Caith her keepsake from the
   fortress. Then, revealing her selkie birth, she changes into a whale
   and heads out to sea.

   Caith rides Dubhain back to Dun Glas to free Nuallan. Once again
   Dubhain is weakened by the witch's spells and Caith has to enter the
   keep on his own. He sees Nuallan helpless in his cell, but Nuallan asks
   him to unlock it with the silver key Caith unknowingly still had all
   this time, the key that would have given Moragacht access to Faery.
   Nuallan takes the key and flees the keep, leaving Caith to fend for
   himself. Moragacht, furious at the loss of the Sidhe, prepares to deal
   with Caith, but he throws the charred piece of wood Firinne gave him
   into the fireplace which releases Padraic, the ghost from the hilltop
   fortress. In an act of revenge, it begins destroying Dun Glas and all
   in it. With the witch's spell now diminishing, Dubhain rescues Caith
   from the keep, while in the loch a whale from the sea turns on the
   beast. The shadow over Faery lifts and Caith and Dubhain resume their
   travels.
