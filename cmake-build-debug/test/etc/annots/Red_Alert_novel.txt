   In a paranoid delusion, moribund US Air Force general Quinten
   unilaterally launches an airborne preventive nuclear attack upon the
   Soviet Union from his command at the Sonora, Texas, Strategic Air
   Command (SAC) bomber base by ordering the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack
   using war plan "Wing Attack Plan R", which authorises a lower-echelon
   SAC commander to retaliate after an enemy first strike has decapitated
   the US government. He attacks with the entire B-52 bomber wing of new
   aircraft, each armed with two nuclear weapons and protected with
   electronic countermeasures to prevent the Soviets from shooting them
   down.

   When the US President and cabinet become aware the attack is underway,
   they assist the Soviet defence interception of the USAF bombers, to
   little effect, because the Soviets destroy only two bombers and damage
   one, the Alabama Angel, which remains airborne and en route to its
   target.

   The US government reestablishes the SAC airbase chain of command, but
   the general who launched the attack, the only man knowing the recall
   code, kills himself before capture and interrogation. His executive
   officer correctly deduces the recall code from among the general's desk
   pad doodles. The code is received by the surviving bomber aircraft, and
   they are successfully recalled, minutes before bombing their targets in
   the Soviet Union, save for the Alabama Angel, whose earlier-damaged
   radio prevents its recalling; it progresses to its target.

   In a last effort to avert a Soviet-American nuclear war, the US
   President offers the Soviet Premier the compensatory right to destroy
   Atlantic City, New Jersey; at the final moment, the Alabama Angel fails
   to destroy its target, and nuclear catastrophe is averted.
