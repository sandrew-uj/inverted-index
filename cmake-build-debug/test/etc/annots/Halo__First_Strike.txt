   The novel begins in orbit above planet Reach, as humanity fights the
   Covenant invasion forces. The last line of defense for the planet is an
   array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The
   Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface of Reach to
   protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the
   Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the
   planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the
   planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden
   headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr.
   Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a
   strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners.
   Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse
   the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant
   forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.

   The book then shifts to events occurring soon after Halo, as the Master
   Chief and Cortana drift through the ruins of Halo, they discover other
   survivors including Sergeant Johnson and Corporal Locklear. The group
   commandeer the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice and use its
   slipspace capabilities to return to the Reach system. To prevent the
   Covenant finding Earth with a tracking device, the humans plan to find
   a suitably undamaged human ship to take them to Earth. Upon arrival the
   group receive a radio signal used by the Spartans in their training
   days. On the surface, they find three Spartans and Vice Admiral
   Danforth Whitcomb, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. The Vice
   Admiral arms a "Nova thermonuclear mine", a weapon that would destroy
   the planet. The Master Chief and his newly acquired team of Spartans
   then proceed to rescue Dr. Halsey and the other Spartans that were
   trapped under the surface of the planet. Meanwhile, Cortana, still
   aboard Ascendant Justice, learns that the Covenant already know the
   location of Earth and are preparing an invasion fleet. For additional
   power, Cortana salvages the derelict UNSC frigate Gettysburg, in effect
   creating a hybrid vessel referred to throughout the book as
   Gettysburg-Ascendant Justice.

   Seeking the Forerunner shard, the Covenant attack, severely damaging
   Ascendant Justice, but are temporarily defeated. In order to make
   repairs, the UNSC forge an alliance with human separatists hidden in an
   asteroid field whose help also allows them to partially repair the
   crippled Gettysburg. Halsey, after saving the clinically-dead Spartan
   Linda-058, abducts Spartan Kelly-087 and flees in a stolen ship,
   leaving Corporal Locklear with instructions to stop the crystal from
   falling into Covenant hands. Locklear decides to destroy the crystal,
   inadvertently killing himself, but stopping the Covenant from tracking
   the crystal's radioactive emissions and by extension the Ascendant
   Justice. However, the Covenant attack the asteroid base in overwhelming
   force, forcing the UNSC forces to flee into slipspace and abandon the
   separatists to destruction.

   With the knowledge that the Covenant are en route to Earth, the Master
   Chief and his fellow Spartans decide to disrupt the invasion force at
   their rendezvous point. The Spartans successfully infiltrate the
   Covenant space station, Unyielding Hierophant, set it to self-destruct
   and escape in a drop-ship. On board the Ascendant Justice, Whitcomb
   tricks the Covenant fleet into following the ship closer to the
   Unyielding Hierophant; when the station explodes the entire Covenant
   armada is destroyed or damaged. Master Chief and the surviving Spartans
   take the partially repaired Gettysburg, which has been equipped with
   Ascendant Justice's slipspace drive, back to Earth with Sgt. Johnson
   and Cortana to warn of the approaching invasion. Meanwhile, the
   Covenant leadership discuss the fate of the "incompetent one," an Elite
   who allowed Halo to be destroyed and Ascendant Justice to be captured;
   setting the stage for Halo 2.
