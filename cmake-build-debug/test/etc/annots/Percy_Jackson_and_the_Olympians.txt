   The book follows the entire story of Percy Jackson, a boy set in modern
   times who discovers he is a demigod. Son of Poseidon, he was abandoned
   by his father because of an oath to not father any more kids, since the
   resulting demigods are too powerful. Percy's journey turns even more
   electrifying when he discovers that numerous people and monsters are
   trying to kill him, as he was the son of one of the big three
   (Poseidon, Zeus, Hades) who were ultimately forbidden to have any kids.
   Percy also finds out that there are even more 'Demigods' in Camp
   Half-Blood at Long Island.

   With his friend  Annabeth by his side, his best
   friend and companion Grover, a satyr, who Percy finds out is actually
   his bodyguard, his journey across the frightening mystic worlds begins.
   Percy soon finds himself fulfilling extraordinary quests and fighting
   battles with the gods.
