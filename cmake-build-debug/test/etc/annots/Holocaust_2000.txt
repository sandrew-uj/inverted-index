   Despite doomsday warnings from throngs of locals, wealthy industrialist
   Robert Caine makes the controversial decision to build a nuclear power
   plant near a sacred cave in the Middle East. But before Caine can reap
   the benefits of his latest bid for global domination, he discovers that
   his son, Angel, is the Antichrist, who is planning to use his father's
   project to trigger the end of the world. As Caine digs deeper, a string
   of suspicious accidents occur that kill off prominent figures who
   criticized the project. He also notes similarities between the design
   of the plant and features of a biblically-prophesied beast that will
   herald the apocalypse. During a dream, Caine envisions the plant rising
   from the sea, then sees its circle of towers take on the form of a
   multiheaded monster.

   The film was released with 2 endings. The European general release
   version of the film features an open ending, with Kirk Douglas in exile
   with his newborn child, and his adult son now successfully developing
   the plant intended to cause Armageddon.

   In the shortened version released in U.S. theaters, home video, and
   network television, a new ending was added where Douglas returns to the
   company and enters a board meeting having explosives hidden on him. In
   the final scene, Angel's face is overlaid with an image of an
   explosion, showing that Robert has successfully thwarted the
   apocalypse. The U.S. DVD from Lionsgate retains the original darker
   ending.
