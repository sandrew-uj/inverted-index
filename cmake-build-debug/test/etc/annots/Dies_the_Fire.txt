   Dies the Fire is a 2004 alternate history and post-apocalyptic novel
   written by S. M. Stirling. It is the first installment of the
   Emberverse series and is a spin-off from S. M. Stirling's Nantucket
   series in which the Massachusetts island of Nantucket is thrown back in
   time from March 17, 1998 to the Bronze Age.

   In Dies the Fire, S. M. Stirling chronicles two groups during "The
   Change", a mysterious worldwide event suddenly alters physical laws so
   electricity, gunpowder, and most other forms of high-energy-density
   technology no longer work. As a result of this, modern civilization
   comes crashing down.
