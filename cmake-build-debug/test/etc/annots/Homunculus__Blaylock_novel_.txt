   A dirigible with a dead pilot has been passing over Victorian London in
   a decaying orbit for some years, arousing the interest of the Royal
   Society, as well as scientist-explorer Langdon St. Ives and the
   evangelist/counterfeiter Shiloh. Shiloh is convinced that the dirigible
   carries his father, a tiny space alien, but withholds this knowledge
   from vivisectionist Dr. Ignacio Narbondo, who he is paying to reanimate
   Shiloh's dead mother, none other than Joanna Southcott. Narbondo and
   the evil millionaire Kelso Drake have their own interest in the alien;
   Drake possesses its spacecraft, which he uses for perverse purposes in
   one of his chain of stop-and-go brothels.

   St. Ives and his friends of the Trismegistus Club are more concerned
   with the inheritance of Jack Owlesby, a fine young fellow affianced to
   Dorothy, the beautiful daughter of toymaker/inventor William Keeble,
   who builds jolly boxes for space aliens, oxygenators, and gigantic
   emeralds. Jack's late father bequeathed him just such a gem, but also
   left behind dark knowledge developed in association with the evil
   Narbondo. St. Ives and the heroic tobacconist Theophilus Godal suspect
   that Narbondo and his assistant, the pimply Willis Pule, are using this
   knowledge to raise the dead, possibly for nefarious purposes. When poor
   Bill Kraken steals what everyone assumes to be Owlesby's emerald in a
   fit of alien-induced delirium tremens, the ambitions of Shiloh,
   Narbondo, Drake, and Pule collide with the heroism of St Ives and Godal
   and the scientific greed of Parsons of the Royal Academy as Hampstead
   Heath turns into a carnival of flying skulls, crumbling ghouls,
   crashing spaceships, and the sparking perversity of the dreadful
   Marseilles Pinkle.^[2]
