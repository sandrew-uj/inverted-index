   Each chapter describes an adventure in Rose's life as she learns to
   help herself and others make good choices. Rose must define for herself
   her role as the only woman of her generation in her family and as an
   heiress in Boston's elite society.

   Motherless for most of her life, 13-year-old Rose looks to her many
   aunts, her friends, and the housemaid Phebe as feminine role models. At
   the same time, she is suddenly confronted with a male guardian and
   seven male cousins, none of whom she knows well, after losing her
   beloved father, the only man in her life.

   Like all of Alcott's books for young people, the story takes a high
   moral tone. Various chapters illustrate the evils of cigar-smoking,
   "yellow-back" novels, high fashion, billiards, and patent nostrums,
   while promoting exercise, a healthy diet, and wholesome experiences of
   many kinds for girls as well as boys. Alcott uses the novel to promote
   education theories and feminist ideas, many of which appear in her
   other books. For example, in choosing Rose's wardrobe, Uncle Alec
   rejects current women's fashions (such as corsets, high heels, veils,
   and bustles) in favor of less restrictive, healthier clothing. Although
   he discourages her from the professional study of medicine, he educates
   her in physiology, a subject her aunts consider inappropriate for
   girls, so she can understand and take charge of her own health. Rose is
   prepared for a career as a wife and mother, yet is taught that she must
   take active, thoughtful control of her fortune so she can use it and
   social position to the best advantage of the larger community. Written
   in an age when few women had control of their own money, property, or
   destinies, Alcott's portrayal of Rose's upbringing is a good deal more
   revolutionary than 21st-century readers may realize.

   The sequel to Eight Cousins is Rose in Bloom (1876), which continues
   Rose's story into young adulthood, depicting courtship and marriage,
   poverty and charity, transcendental poetry and prose, and illness and
   death among her family and friends.
