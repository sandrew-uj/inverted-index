   Concept art illustrating the conflicts between Skynet and the
   Resistance in a post-apocalyptic, futuristic setting, envisioned by
   creator James Cameron for the 1984 film The Terminator

   The central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between
   the nearly-extinct human race and the world-spanning synthetic
   intelligence that is Skynet. Skynet is positioned in the first film,
   The Terminator (1984), as a U.S. strategic "Global Digital Defense
   Network" computer system by Cyberdyne Systems which becomes self-aware.
   Shortly after activation, Skynet perceives all humans as a threat to
   its existence and formulates a plan to systematically wipe out humanity
   itself. The system initiates a nuclear first strike against Russia,
   thereby ensuring a devastating second strike and a nuclear holocaust
   which wipes out much of humanity in the resulting nuclear war. In the
   post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet later builds up its own autonomous
   machine-based military capability which includes the Terminators used
   against individual human targets and therefore proceeds to wage a
   persistent total war against the surviving elements of humanity, some
   of whom have militarily organized themselves into a Resistance. At some
   point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of time travel, and
   both it and the Resistance seek to use this technology in order to win
   the war; either by altering or accelerating past events, or by
   preventing the apocalyptic timeline.
