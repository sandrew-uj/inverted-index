   Robert Blair, a local solicitor, is called on to defend two women,
   Marion Sharpe and her mother, who are accused of kidnapping and beating
   a fifteen-year-old war orphan named Betty Kane. Set in Milford, the
   novel opens with the Sharpes about to be interviewed by local police
   and Scotland Yard, represented by Inspector Alan Grant (who is the
   protagonist of five other Tey novels). Marion calls Blair and, although
   his firm does not do criminal cases, he agrees to come out to their
   home, "The Franchise", to look out for their interests during the
   questioning.

   Betty's account is that during the Easter holidays, she went to stay
   with her aunt and uncle, the Tilsits, near Larborough. After a week,
   she wrote to her adoptive parents, the Wynns, to say she was enjoying
   herself and would spend another three weeks with the Tilsits. Then one
   evening, waiting for a bus, the Sharpe women approached her in their
   car and offered her a lift. They took her to the Franchise, demanded
   that she become a domestic worker, and, upon her refusal, imprisoned
   her in the attic. Betty alleges that they starved and beat her until
   she escaped.

   When Blair meets Marion and Mrs. Sharpe, who are sensible and
   forthright, he believes them innocent, and he distrusts Betty. Yet
   Betty does have bruises from a beating, and she describes items and
   rooms inside the Franchise accurately.

   Later in the week, a newspaper runs a long story from Betty's side,
   based on an interview with her vengeful brother, Leslie. Robert Blair
   now finds that the townspeople of Milford are mostly against the
   Sharpes. An exception is Stanley Peters, a local car mechanic and
   friend of Blair, who says that Betty reminds him of an ex-girlfriend
   who was promiscuous and deceitful.

   As interest in the case builds over a few weeks, locals engage in overt
   hostility against the Sharpes: public snubbing, then graffiti on their
   walls, then smashing of the windows; the vandalism culminates when the
   Franchise is destroyed by arson. Stanley has become a friend and ally
   to the Sharpes, serving as a night guard for them, and then providing
   them shelter when their home is burned down.

   Blair is assisted in his search for clues against Betty Kane by his
   cousin, Nevil Bennet, who also works at the law firm, and his friend
   Kevin Macdermott, a flamboyant London barrister.

   The clues that they chiefly uncover are in the manner of character
   evidence, and Tey supplies a colourful variety. Examples include the
   facts that Betty has an eidetic memory; when Betty returns home after
   the alleged kidnapping, the only item she has with her is lipstick; she
   tells the Wynns about her abduction not right away, but in various
   details over a few days; Betty's mother was promiscuous, "a bad mother
   and a bad wife", according to a neighbour; Mrs. Tilsit, the aunt, tells
   Blair that Betty spent most of her holiday time not with her aunt and
   uncle, but in unsupervised freedom: going to the cinema, using buses,
   and eating lunch away from home; Betty had befriended a teenage girl
   who had once worked for the Sharpes as a cleaner, whom Betty had
   bullied. She is described by a couple of people as demure and looking
   as though "butter wouldn't melt in her mouth"; one of them, a
   restaurant waiter, tells Blair that Betty came in for tea several
   times, looking wholesome: "And then one day she picked up the man at
   the next table. You could have knocked me over with a feather."

   Robert Blair, who has been a lifelong bachelor living with his
   woolly-minded Aunt Lin, becomes strongly attracted to Marion Sharpe,
   who is described as gypsy-ish (because of her dark hair, browned skin,
   and habit of wearing colourful scarves). Marion, who likes Blair, is
   however determined to remain single and stay with her sharp-tongued
   mother, who is her best friend. Nevil, although engaged, also finds
   Marion attractive; an aspiring poet, he describes her as "all compact
   of fire and metal. ... People don't marry women like Marion Sharpe, any
   more than they marry winds and clouds. Any more than they marry Joan of
   Arc."

   The book maintains the suspense of the Sharpes' guilt or innocence for
   the first half, and then, when the reader feels certain they are
   innocent (though all the evidence points to them) the tension comes
   from how they will avoid being wrongfully incarcerated. Things go right
   down to the wire, with a lot of detailed investigative work paying off
   in a satisfying fashion at the trial.
