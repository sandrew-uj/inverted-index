   When the book begins, the Good Magician Humfrey, and his son Hugo, run
   into the Gap dragon while filling a vial with water from the Fountain
   of Youth. Humpfrey tells Hugo to douse the dragon with the water, and
   Hugo does so but accidentally sprays Humpfrey as well. Humpfrey
   regresses to the age of a baby, as does the dragon. Queen Irene
   realizes Princess Ivy has wandered off, and begins a quest to find her
   daughter. Luckily, Ivy comes across Humfrey's 8-year-old son Hugo, and
   - due to her unknown talent of enhancement - Hugo temporarily becomes
   smarter, braver, and stronger when she tells him he is. Ivy also
   manages to enhance the positive qualities of the Gap Dragon, and names
   him Stanley Steamer.

   In Castle Roogna, Dor accidentally put a forget spell on the Gap Chasm
   (the huge rift that splits Xanth in two), while trying to escape a
   horde of harpies and goblins, with the result being that everyone
   forgot the Gap Chasm existed, with the exception of the people who live
   near it. In this book, the forget spell is beginning to disintegrate
   into "forget whorls" spinning off into the nearby forest (due to the
   Time Of No Magic caused when Bink released the Demon X(A/N)th), causing
   confusion and memory loss. Ivy ends up walking through a forget whirl
   and it causes her to forget how to get home.

   Near the end of the novel, all the characters join forces against a
   swarm of wiggles, which threaten the welfare of Xanth by burrowing
   through anything and everything in their path.
