   A 2003 paperback edition of The Hollowing with cover art by Larry
   Rostant

   The Hollowing shares the third person narrative viewpoint as does its
   predecessor, Lavondyss. The narrative begins in the 1950s, merely one
   year after the events that take place in Lavondyss, but the majority of
   the story takes place in 1968. Inside Ryhope wood, Tallis Keeton's
   young friend, Alex Bradley, remains an adolescent when he would
   otherwise be twenty years old. This is possible because the rate of
   time inside the wood is not synchronized with the rate of time outside
   the wood. The story's protagonist is Alex's father, Richard Bradley.
   Richard is on a quest to locate his lost son in the wood, a very
   dangerous task because Alex's overactive imagination generates mythagos
   dangerous to both himself and others.

   The day Tallis Keeton disappears into Ryhope wood in Lavondyss, her
   father, James Keeton, disappears into the wood to locate her. While he
   spends only four days in Ryhope wood, over one year of time passes in
   the outside world. When he turns up, he is clutching Moondream, one of
   Tallis' masks, and is placed in a mental hospital. He is kept close
   company by Alex Bradley, a young playmate of Tallis', who alone can
   calm James. James Keeton has a number of episodes in which he appears
   to communicate with Tallis through the mask. In a dramatic scene,
   Richard Bradley sees James Keeton collapse and die. At the same time,
   his son Alex is physically traumatized by a mythic force. This
   compromises Alex's mental faculties and he is confined to the same
   mental hospital. Alex escapes the mental hospital and his highly
   decayed remains are subsequently found, so he is presumed dead.

   After six years Alex's father, Richard Bradley, receives evidence that
   Alex may yet be alive in Ryhope wood. Richard joins a scientific
   expedition to locate his son in the wood, rendered all the more
   dangerous by the mythagos feeding off Alex's imagination.

   During his quest in the wood, Richard Bradley develops a romantic
   relationship with Helen Silverlock, a Native American. In addition to
   introducing Native American culture into Ryhope wood, mythagos about
   Jack (as in Jack and the Beanstalk), the Tower of Babel and Jason and
   the Argonauts appear, the last two of which involve variations on myths
   that are uncharacteristically non-English in origin.^[2]^[3]^[4]
