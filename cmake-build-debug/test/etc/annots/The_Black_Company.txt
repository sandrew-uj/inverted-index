   The series follows an elite mercenary unit, The Black Company, last of
   the Free Companies of Khatovar, through roughly forty years of its
   approximately four-hundred-year history. Cook mixes fantasy with
   military fiction in gritty, down-to-earth portrayals of the Company's
   chief personalities and its struggles.

   The main chronology spans nine novels, which can be grouped into three
   sections: The Books of the North recount the Company's dealings with
   the Empire of Lady; The Books of the South follow the Company on its
   journey back to its beginnings in Khatovar; Glittering Stone sees the
   Company achieve victory over its employer's enemies, and move on to its
   destiny.

   Additionally, there is one spin-off novel, The Silver Spike, which
   follows events concerning former members of the Company and one of its
   adversaries.
