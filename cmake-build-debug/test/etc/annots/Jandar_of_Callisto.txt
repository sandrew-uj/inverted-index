   The story is told in the first person by the hero, Jonathan Dark, who
   is represented to be its author. Carter, the actual author, claims to
   have merely edited the manuscript, which, like subsequent works in the
   series, supposedly found its way to him from the ruins of the ancient
   city of Arangkhor in Cambodia.

   Dark, a helicopter pilot transporting medical supplies in Southeast
   Asia, is forced down in the jungles of Cambodia, where he discovers
   Arangkhor. There he slides into a well made of a mysteriously slippery
   substance, which proves to be a device of unknown provenance that
   teleports him to another world. The world in question is eventually
   determined to be the Jovian moon of Callisto, which beneath a projected
   illusion of airless desolation turns out to have a breathable
   atmosphere, an alien biology, and human inhabitants (presumably
   descended from victims of the well during the period before Arangkhor
   was abandoned). Callisto is known to its inhabitants as Thanator.

   After nearly falling victim to a Yathib, one of the local predators,
   Dark is saved by a nomadic tribe of Yathoon, a race of intelligent
   insectoids. Rescue proves a mixed blessing, as he is also enslaved.
   While with them he learns Thanator's language, which is shared by
   Yathoon and human alike, and his captors learn his name, more or less.
   "Jandar" is the closest they can render "Jon Dark," and he remains
   Jandar through the rest of the series. Escaping, he encounters a
   beautiful woman in peril. For Jandar, it's love at first sight; she
   takes a bit longer to warm to him--three whole books, actually. She is
   the princess Darloona, who has been exiled from her native city-state
   of Shondakar by the conquering Black Legion. His attempts to aid her
   are not very effective, and they fall into the hands of another tribe
   of Yathoon.

   They are delivered from this second captivity by the appearance of an
   airship commanded by Thuton, prince of the city-state of Zanadar. The
   Zanadarians are "Sky Pirates"--raiders who use the aerial technology
   they alone possess to abstract the possessions of others, in this
   instance Jandar and Darloona from the Yathoon. Thuton proves
   well-disposed to his fellow royal, but less so toward Jandar, who
   jealously goads him into a fight. As the prince is a master of the
   sword and the earthman has never picked up that particular skill, the
   outcome is predictable--and humiliating. The upshot is that Dark is
   once again a slave, this time in Zanadar.

   In the Sky Pirates' city he manages to escape again, learns to fence,
   and raises his fellow slaves in a rebellion against their oppressors.
   In a bid to rescue Darloona, he takes on Thuton a second time. His
   comrades, who have taken over one of the Zanadarians' airships, are
   able to extract both him and the princess before he can be killed.
   Fleeing the city, they restore Darloona to her people, the Ku Thad, who
   have been living in the jungles of the Grand Kumala since their exile
   from Shondakar.

   The celebration is short-lived, however, as the princess is shortly
   afterward carried off by a raiding party from the Black Legion.
