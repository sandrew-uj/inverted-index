   In a frame story, a rich couple sailing alone in space, Jinn and
   Phyllis, rescue and translate a manuscript from a floating bottle.
   The manuscript was written by journalist Ulysse Merou, who in 2500 was
   invited by wealthy Professor Antelle to accompany him and his disciple,
   physician Arthur Levain, to Betelgeuse. Because they travel close to
   the speed of light, time dilation causes centuries to pass on Earth
   during their two years in transit. They land their shuttle on a
   temperate, lushly forested planet which they name Soror (Latin for
   sister). They can breathe the air, drink the water and eat the fruit.
   Attracted by a woman whom they call Nova, they swim below a scenic
   waterfall. She is frightened by their pet chimpanzee, Hector, and
   strangles it. Her tribe, who exhibit the behavior of dumb animals,
   wreck the newcomers' clothing and shuttle.

   Gorillas, fully dressed as hunters, attack the tribe with firearms.
   Many are killed, including Arthur. Ulysse is captured with the
   survivors and brought to a city populated by apes. Ape clothing matches
   that of 20th century Earth humans, except that the apes wear gloves
   instead of shoes on their prehensile feet. The apes smoke tobacco,
   photograph their hunting trophies, drink through straws and appear
   utterly civilized. Their society is divided into three strata:
   aggressive gorilla police and military, conservative orangutan
   politicians and religious authorities, and liberal chimpanzee
   scientists.

   In an urban biological research facility, Ulysse recognizes
   conditioning methods being used on captured humans. He is mated with
   Nova. Curious chimpanzee researcher Zira takes an interest in his
   geometric drawings and his ability to speak a few simian words. With
   help from Zira's fiance, Cornelius, Ulysse makes a speech in front of
   several thousand apes. He is granted freedom and is given tailored
   clothing. Antelle reverts to primitive humanity in the zoo and is moved
   to the laboratory for safety, where he is mated to a young female.

   Cornelius, an archaeologist, excavates an ancient human city. An
   unconscious human lab subject recites from racial memory the events
   that led to the fall of human civilization: humans tamed apes and
   eventually used them as servants. As apes learned to talk, a cerebral
   laziness took hold of the humans. Apes gradually took over human homes,
   driving the humans into camps outside of the cities. In the final
   memory, apes attacked the last human camp, carrying only whips.

   Nova bears Ulysse a son, Sirius, who walks and talks at three months.
   Fearing for their lives, they take the place of the human test subjects
   in a space flight experiment. Because all humans look alike to apes,
   they are able to escape without notice and they rendezvous with the
   orbiting ship. Ulysse programs the ship back to Earth. As they fly over
   Paris, Orly Airport and the Eiffel Tower look the same. When they land,
   however, they are greeted by a field officer in a Jeep who is a
   gorilla. It is subsequently revealed, via the frame story, that Jinn
   and Phyllis are actually civilized chimpanzees, and they discard
   Ulysse's story as sheer fantasy because they find the idea of
   intelligent humans unbelievable.
