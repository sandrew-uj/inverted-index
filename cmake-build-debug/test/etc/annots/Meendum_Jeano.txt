   Ravi and Mano have taken over Jeeva's dictatorship and rule the country
   with his holographic image without public knowledge. Since Nila is the
   most beautiful woman they make her a queen of the new kingdom. But Nila
   is a queen only nominally, Ravi and Mano control the entire government.
   Jeano, the robo pet of Nila, helps her find her husband and with a self
   learning mechanism reveals many truths about the present situation. It
   learns many things from various authors through a variety of book
   collections and keeps them in its knowledge base. Since its interfering
   in Ravi and Mano's secret government, they ban all robopets in the
   country but Jeano finds Nila and tries to help her.
