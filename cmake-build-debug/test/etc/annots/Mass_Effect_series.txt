   The Mass Effect original trilogy takes place in a fictional version of
   the Milky Way towards the end of the 22nd century. In 2148, humanity
   discovered an alien outpost on Mars, and learn that Charon is actually
   an alien artifact known as a "mass relay" that enables
   faster-than-light travel to other mass relays located across the
   galaxy. Humanity comes into contact with numerous other space-faring
   alien species, some far more advanced than humans. Humanity's first
   encounter resulted in the First Contact War, but the Council, a ruling
   body for the galaxy, intervened to achieve peace and welcomed humanity.
   Among the main species humanity meets include: the asari, a race of
   peaceful monogendered beings closely resembling blue-skinned human
   women; the salarians, an amphibious species with considerable
   technological and intellectual prowess; and the turians, a heavily
   militaristic race of raptor-like humanoids who fought humanity in the
   First Contact War. The center of the Council's governing power is the
   Citadel, another artifact and a massive space station that, like the
   mass relays, were made by a race known as the Protheans believed to be
   the progenitor race for all species but long since disappeared. Over
   the next few decades, humanity is given access to new technology,
   allowing them to colonize new planets, and they are made part of the
   Citadel Security (C-Sec) forces, a highly regarded position that other
   species had been long waiting for and take resentment over. Numerous
   other inter-species conflicts remain active at the time of the first
   game, results of past wars and conflicts.

   The first three games center on the character of Commander Shepard
   (whose gender and personality are determined by the player), a leading
   Special Forces soldier in Earth's Systems Alliance space force, the
   Systems Alliance Navy. After an Earth colony discovers a new Prothean
   artifact, it is attacked by an unknown vessel, and the Council names
   Shepard its first human SPECTRE (SPECial Tactics and REconnaissance),
   an elite agent with associated authority and impunity, to investigate
   the incident. Shepard comes in contact with the artifact and has a
   vision of war and death across the galaxy. Following their vision,
   Shepard discovers that the strange craft is one of thousands of
   artificial lifeforms called Reapers, and learns that every
   fifty-thousand years, the Reapers scour through the Milky Way and
   eliminate all higher forms of life, leaving the younger species to
   advance and thrive until the next cycle as to prevent constant war and
   chaos, part of what the Protheans had left behind along with their
   artifacts. The appearance of the Reapers in this cycle is being
   manipulated by numerous forces, including a human-centrist terrorist
   organization known as Cerberus led by the Illusive Man who believe they
   can control the Reapers and use them for humanity's benefit. Shepard
   and their allies discover the Citadel is key to ending the Reapers'
   cycle and setting the fate of the galaxy.

   The fourth game takes place in the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda
   galaxy, 634 years after the events of its predecessor. In the midst of
   events of the first three games, the combined races of the Milky Way
   sent a number of ships to Andromeda to establish the Nexus, a
   space-borne operations base and a number of colonies to accept future
   colonists once contact is established. After over 600 years of travel
   in suspended animation, they arrive to find the Heleus Cluster in
   brutal conflict between two native races: the Kett, a barbaric race
   obsessed with assimilating the traits of other sentient species through
   a process known as "exaltation"; and the Angara, a humanoid species
   whose civilization has recently been targeted and nearly decimated by
   the Kett. The Heleus Cluster is also the location of a series of ruins
   predating an advanced, spacefaring race known as the Jardaan. The
   Jardaan made use of powerful terraforming technologies to colonize
   worlds in the Heleus Cluster, which was otherwise extremely hazardous
   and naturally unsustainable for life. They later fled from the Heleus
   Cluster three centuries before the arrival of the Milky Way races, when
   a protracted battle against an unknown enemy faction resulted in the
   usage of a weapon of mass destruction aboard a Jardaan space station.
   The weapon's activation unleashed a cataclysmic energy phenomenon known
   as the Scourge, which spread across the cluster and greatly damaged the
   Jardaan's terraforming systems. After the Jardaan left, the Angara,
   genetically engineered creations of the elder race, began to develop
   their own civilization before falling under attack by the encroaching
   Kett. With the Milky Way species' arrival, it becomes the responsibly
   of Pathfinder Ryder (who, like Shepard, is also customizable by the
   player) and their allies to shut down the malfunctioning terraforming
   systems, deal with the Kett and Angara attacks, and make planets
   habitable for colonization.
