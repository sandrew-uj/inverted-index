   The Shining mainly takes place in the fictional Overlook Hotel, an
   isolated, haunted resort hotel located in the Colorado Rockies. The
   history of the hotel, which is described in backstory by several
   characters, includes the deaths of some of its guests and of former
   winter caretaker Delbert Grady, who "succumbed to cabin fever" and
   killed his family and himself.

   Jack Torrance, his wife Wendy, and their five-year-old son Danny move
   into the hotel after Jack accepts the position as winter caretaker.
   Jack is an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic with anger
   issues which, prior to the story, had caused him to accidentally break
   Danny's arm and lose his position as a teacher after assaulting a
   student. Jack hopes that the hotel's seclusion will help him reconnect
   with his family and give him the motivation needed to work on a play.
   Danny, unknown to his parents, possesses psychic abilities that Dick
   Hallorann referred to as "the shining" that enable him to read minds
   and experience premonitions as well as clairvoyance. The Torrances
   arrive at the hotel on closing day and are given a tour by the manager.
   They meet Dick Hallorann, the chef, who also possesses similar
   abilities to Danny's and helps to explain them to him, giving Hallorann
   and Danny a special connection. The remaining staff and guests
   depart the hotel, leaving the Torrances alone in the hotel for the
   winter.

   As the Torrances settle in at the Overlook, Danny sees ghosts and
   frightening visions. Although Danny is close to his parents, he does
   not tell either of them about his visions because he senses that the
   care-taking job is important to his father and the family's future.
   Wendy considers leaving Jack at the Overlook to finish the job by
   himself; Danny refuses, thinking his father will be happier if they
   stayed. However, Danny soon realizes that his presence in the hotel
   makes the supernatural activity more powerful, turning echoes of past
   tragedies into dangerous threats. Apparitions take solid form and the
   garden's topiary animals come to life. The winter snowfall leaves the
   Torrances cut off from the outside world in the isolated hotel.

   The Overlook has difficulty possessing Danny, so it begins to possess
   Jack by frustrating his need and desire to work and by enticing him
   with the storied history of the hotel through a scrapbook and records
   in the basement. Jack starts to develop cabin fever and becomes
   increasingly unstable, destroying a CB radio and sabotaging a
   snowmobile, the only two links with the outside world the Torrances
   had. One day, after a fight with Wendy, Jack finds the hotel's bar
   fully stocked with liquor despite being previously empty, and witnesses
   a party at which he meets the ghost of a bartender named Lloyd. He also
   dances with a young woman ghost who tries to seduce Jack. As he gets
   drunk, the hotel uses the ghost of the former caretaker Grady to urge
   Jack to kill his wife and son. He initially resists, but the increasing
   influence of the hotel combined with Jack's own alcoholism and anger
   prove too great. He succumbs to his dark side and the control of the
   hotel. Wendy and Danny get the better of Jack after he attacks
   Wendy, locking him inside the walk-in pantry, but the ghost of Delbert
   Grady releases him after he makes Jack promise to bring him Danny and
   to kill Wendy. Jack attacks Wendy with one of the hotel's roque
   mallets, grievously injuring her, but she escapes to the caretaker's
   suite and locks herself in the bathroom. Jack attempts to break the
   door with the mallet, but Wendy slashes his hand with a razor blade to
   deter him.

   Meanwhile, Hallorann has received a psychic distress call from Danny
   while working at a winter resort in Florida. Hallorann rushes back to
   the Overlook, only to be attacked by the topiary animals and severely
   injured by Jack. As Jack pursues Danny through the Overlook and corners
   him on the hotel's top floor, he briefly gains control of himself and
   implores Danny to run away after Danny stands his ground and denounces
   Jack as a mask and false face worn by the hotel. The hotel takes
   control of Jack again, making him violently batter his own face and
   skull into ruin with the mallet, destroying the last vestiges of Jack
   and leaving a being controlled by the hotel's own malevolent "manager"
   personality. Remembering that Jack has neglected to relieve the
   pressure on the hotel's unstable boiler, Danny informs the hotel that
   it is about to explode. As Danny, Wendy, and Hallorann flee, the
   hotel-creature rushes to the basement in an attempt to vent the
   pressure, but it is too late and the boiler explodes, killing Jack and
   destroying the Overlook. Fighting off a last attempt by the hotel to
   possess him, Hallorann guides Danny and Wendy to safety.

   The book's epilogue is set during the next summer. Hallorann, who has
   taken a chef's job at a resort in Maine, comforts Danny over the loss
   of his father as Wendy recuperates from the injuries Jack inflicted on
   her.
