   Set in the aftermath of a nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the
   United States, the book chronicles the investigations of Carl Landry, a
   reporter for the Boston Globe. As the story unfolds, Carl attempts to
   uncover the events leading up to the war, while at the same time
   running from those who would have the truth buried.

   The story begins in 1972, ten years after a nuclear war between the
   U.S. and the Soviets, which was precipitated by the Cuban Missile
   Crisis. Washington, D.C., New York, Omaha, San Diego, Miami, and other
   U.S. cities, principally those surrounding military bases, have either
   been destroyed, damaged, or rendered uninhabitable by Soviet nuclear
   attacks. Philadelphia is now the capital of the United States, and
   although the Mexican-born President George W. Romney is nominally in
   office, the U.S. is effectively under martial law. The Soviets have
   been utterly devastated by U.S. nuclear strikes. Cuba is an atomic
   ruin, with Spain responsible for relief efforts aiding what is left of
   the island's population.

   One consequence of the war is that America's embroilment in Vietnam is
   abruptly curtailed. U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam (and
   indeed across the world) are withdrawn in order to stabilise the US in
   the aftermath of the Soviet missile and air strikes. The People's
   Republic of China has also collapsed, with numerous regional warlords
   waging a civil war against each other.

   U.S. nuclear strikes on the Soviets led to the collapse of the Warsaw
   Pact, and also to the release of a massive fallout cloud over much of
   Asia, killing further millions after the destruction of the Soviets. As
   a consequence, the U.S. has become a pariah in the eyes of much of the
   world. Many governments regard members of the U.S. Air Force as war
   criminals, and its servicemen are advised not to travel abroad. After
   the 1962 war, nearly all the remaining countries of the globe have
   renounced possession of nuclear weapons. The United States alone
   retains an atomic arsenal.

   Western Europe survived the war largely unscathed. NATO collapsed
   almost as soon as hostilities commenced, and France and a reunited
   Germany now preside over the continent. The United Kingdom and Canada
   remain allies of the U.S., and actually assist in post-war
   reconstruction efforts in U.S. states hit hardest by the war. The
   British, in the period after 1962, has managed to regain much of its
   pre-1939 colonial confidence in the vacuum left by the destruction of
   the Soviet Union and the emasculation of the U.S. in world affairs. The
   policy of decolonialisation has been halted and even reversed; some
   newly independent nations even return to the remaining British "Empire"
   in the new, uncertain world created after the "Cuban War". While
   British aid is welcome, there is also a sense of resentment among the
   American population over excessive dependence on the British. The large
   presence of British and Canadian military personnel in the U.S. is also
   a source of contention, with some Americans wondering whether their
   allies possess ulterior motives.

   The story covers two parallel plotlines. The first involves Landry's
   attempts to discover what happened in Washington, D.C. in October 1962.
   U.S. military propaganda accounts maintain that the Cuban war broke out
   because of John F. Kennedy's recklessness and incompetence; these
   claims are generally believed. Kennedy and his officials are regarded
   as butchers and war criminals and the only senior surviving member of
   JFK's inner circle, McGeorge Bundy, is imprisoned in Fort Leavenworth.
   In contrast, U.S. military commanders (notably the Chief of the Air
   Force, General Curtis LeMay) are portrayed as the saviors of the
   nation. During the course of the novel Landry gradually discovers that
   it was Kennedy who sought to prevent the crisis over Cuba from
   escalating into war, and that last-minute attempts to achieve a deal
   with Nikita Khrushchev to end the crisis were deliberately sabotaged by
   Curtis and other generals.

   The second plotline concerns British-U.S. relations. Landry and a
   British journalist, Sandy Price, discover that elements within the
   British government and security services are plotting a military
   takeover (or anschluss) of the U.S. This plan is underway near the end
   of the novel, and is called off at the last minute.
