   Andrea Sachs, a recent graduate of Brown University with a degree in
   English, moves to New York City with her best friend, Lily, a graduate
   student at Columbia. Andrea hopes to find a career in publishing and
   blankets the city with her resume. She believes she'll be closer to her
   dream of working for The New Yorker if she can get a job in the
   magazine industry. She gets a surprise interview at the Elias-Clark
   Group and is hired as junior assistant for Miranda Priestly,
   editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Runway. Although she knows
   little of the fashion world, everyone tells her that "a million girls
   would die for  job". If she manages to work for Miranda for a
   year, people tell her, she can have her choice of jobs within the
   magazine industry.

   At a celebrity party, Andrea meets Christian Collinsworth, a
   charismatic Yale graduate who is considered one of the hot, new
   up-and-coming writers of their generation. They are attracted to each
   other, which complicates her relationship with her boyfriend, Alex.

   Andrea's relationships become entangled because of her new job. Lily
   increasingly turns to alcohol and picks up dubious men to relieve the
   pressure of graduate school. Alex, struggling with his own demanding
   job as an inner-city schoolteacher, grows frustrated with Andrea's long
   hours and constant stress. Andrea's relationship with her family also
   suffers. Matters finally come to a head when her co-worker, Emily, gets
   mononucleosis and Andrea must travel to Paris with Miranda in her
   stead. In Paris, she has a surprise encounter with Christian. Later
   that night, Miranda finally lets down her guard and asks Andrea what
   she has learned, and where she wants to work afterwards. She promises
   to place phone calls to people she knows at the New Yorker on Andrea's
   behalf once her year is up and suggests she take on some small writing
   assignments at Runway.

   Back at the hotel, Andrea gets urgent calls from Alex and her parents
   asking her to call them. She does and learns that Lily is comatose
   after driving drunk and wrecking a car. Though her family and Alex
   pressure her to return home, she tells Miranda she will honor her
   commitment to Runway. Miranda is pleased, and says her future in
   magazine publishing is bright, but phones with another impossible
   demand at Christian Dior's Paris fashion show. Andrea decides that her
   family and friends are more important than her job, and realizes to her
   horror that she is becoming more and more like Miranda. She refuses to
   comply with Miranda's latest outrageous request, and when Miranda
   scolds her publicly, Andrea replies, "Fuck you, Miranda. Fuck you." She
   is fired on the spot, and returns home to reconnect with friends and
   family. Her romantic relationship with Alex is beyond repair, but they
   remain friends. Lily recovers and is lucky to receive only community
   service for her DUI charge.

   In the last chapter Andrea learns her dispute with Miranda made her a
   minor celebrity when the incident made Page Six. Afraid she has been
   blacklisted from publishing for good, she moves back with her parents.
   She works on short fiction and finances her unemployment with profits
   made from reselling the designer clothing she was provided for her
   Paris trip. Seventeen buys one of her stories. At the novel's end, she
   returns to the Elias-Clark building to discuss a position at one of the
   company's other magazines and sees Miranda's new junior assistant, who
   looks as harried and put-upon as she once did.
