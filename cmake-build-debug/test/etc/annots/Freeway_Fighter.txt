   In Freeway Fighter, to save his town of New Hope, the hero must cross
   the wilderness to bring back needed supplies from the oil refinery at
   San Anglo. Game designer Lawrence Schick describes the scenario as
   being the same type as Mad Max or Car Wars.

   The story takes places in a post-apocalyptic United States, after much
   of the world's population has fallen victim to a deadly plague. The
   survivors huddle together in isolated settlements, while the roads are
   dominated by lawless nomads in heavily armed vehicles. The player takes
   the role of a citizen of the town New Hope who must drive their armed
   Dodge Interceptor motorcar across the wastes in order to procure a
   tanker filled with a fresh supply of petrol for their community. The
   story also provides a secondary quest: locating and rescuing a
   kidnapped New Hope leader from outlaws.
