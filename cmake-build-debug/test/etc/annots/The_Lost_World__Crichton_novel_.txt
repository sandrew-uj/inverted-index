   In 1993, four years after the disaster at Jurassic Park, chaos theorist
   and mathematician Ian Malcolm--who is revealed to have survived the
   events of the previous novel--reluctantly teams up with paleontologist
   Richard Levine. The two men attempt to search for a "lost world" of
   dinosaurs following rumors of strange animal corpses washing up on the
   shores of Costa Rica. In 1995, they learn of Site B on Isla Sorna, the
   "production facility" where the now-defunct company InGen hatched and
   grew the dinosaurs for their Jurassic Park theme park on nearby Isla
   Nublar.

   Afraid that the Costa Rican government will find Isla Sorna and destroy
   the dinosaurs, Levine hastily embarks on an expedition to the island
   without Malcolm. He arrives with a Costa Rican guide named Diego, but
   shortly after arriving, the two are attacked by mysterious creatures
   (later identified as a pair of Carnotaurus) who kill Diego. Eventually,
   Malcolm learns that Levine has gone missing there. Malcolm then goes to
   the island with a rescue team consisting of Jack "Doc" Thorne, an
   engineer and retired university professor; Eddie Carr, Thorne's
   assistant; and two stowaway children, R. B. "Arby" Benton and Kelly
   Curtis, who were working as Levine's research assistants as part of a
   school project. Dr. Sarah Harding, an animal behaviorist and former
   lover of Malcolm's, is also approached to join the expedition. Though
   she is initially unsure, she ultimately decides to meet them there.

   The group arrives on the island with weapons and a conjoined pair of
   heavily modified, specially equipped RV trailers that serve as a mobile
   laboratory. They find and explore a geothermal-powered complex of
   abandoned InGen buildings, including a worker village and a laboratory.
   They also eventually find Levine, who is overjoyed at the trove of
   information he can glean from this "lost world".

   Simultaneously, another group--consisting of geneticist Lewis Dodgson
   and his assistant Howard King, and "celebrity" biologist George
   Baselton--learns of Levine's expedition and travels to Isla Sorna
   independently. The new group plans to steal dinosaur eggs for Biosyn,
   the rival company of InGen responsible for the sabotage that led to the
   Jurassic Park disaster. As they are about to leave, they encounter
   Harding and offer to give her a ride to Isla Sorna. However, just as
   they approach the island, Dodgson attempts to kill her by shoving her
   off the boat. She survives, though, and manages to meet up with
   Malcolm's group on the island.

   Levine and Malcolm make many observations of the dinosaurs' behavior
   from the "high hide", an enclosed blind that is set above the ground on
   scaffolding. They soon learn that Dodgson's group has arrived on the
   island. Meanwhile, Dodgson's group is attacked by a pair of
   Tyrannosaurus as they try to steal eggs from the animals' nest,
   resulting in Baselton's death. Dodgson and King become separated after
   the attack.

   Later, while inspecting the T. rex nest, Malcolm finds that one of the
   infants had been injured and has a broken leg. He instructs Eddie to
   kill it because it has no chance of surviving in the wild. Unbeknownst
   to the group, Eddie refuses to kill the injured animal and brings it
   back to the trailers. When the group discovers the animal, Malcolm and
   Harding begrudgingly agree to set and cast its leg while the rest of
   the group returns to the high hide. As night approaches, the nocturnal
   Velociraptors emerge from the jungle and kill King. As Malcolm and
   Harding finish setting the T. rex's leg, the parents come looking for
   their infant and attack the trailers, pushing one of them over a cliff
   and injuring Malcolm. Thorne rescues Malcolm and Harding, while the
   raptors attack the high hide and kill Eddie. Malcolm is injected with a
   high dosage of morphine which relaxes him, though not without causing
   him to hallucinate as he had in the first novel. Arby, trapped in a
   survival cage, is kidnapped by the raptors but is later rescued.

   The group later takes refuge from the raptors in the general store of
   the old InGen worker village. The group attempts to formulate a plan to
   reach the landing site where the helicopter is set to meet them in the
   morning. When Thorne ventures out into the village to search for fuel,
   he survives an encounter with the pair of chameleon-like Carnotaurus.
   Levine and Harding drive the Carnotaurus away by shining their lights
   on them and making them change their skin patterns too fast.

   The next morning, Harding heads out to recover one of the team's
   vehicles that Thorne had left behind while saving her and Malcolm from
   the trailer, as it may be the only vehicle large enough to carry
   everyone to the rendezvous point. However, upon finding it, she
   encounters Dodgson attempting to steal the vehicle for himself.
   Suddenly, a T. rex approaches them, and they both hide under the car.
   However, Harding pushes Dodgson back out, and the T. rex picks him up,
   carries him to her nest, and feeds him to her offspring. Harding sets
   out to reach the helicopter before it can take off without the group,
   but she finds she is too late. Eventually, the group discovers a boat
   docked on the island, managing to reach it just as the raptors finally
   break into the general store.

   As the group sails away, Malcolm reveals information that he discovered
   in the laboratory: during Site B's active years, InGen fed the young
   carnivorous dinosaurs sheep extract infected with prions, which cause a
   disease that shortens the dinosaurs' lifespans. Although the scientists
   contained the disease, it began to spread once again after they
   abandoned the island. Malcolm and Harding say that the disease will
   lead to the eventual extinction of the dinosaurs on Isla Sorna. Despite
   this, Thorne declares that the fact that they are all alive and that
   they are returning home is really all that matters.
