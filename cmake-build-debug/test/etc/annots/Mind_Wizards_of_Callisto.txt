   A force of four airships bearing Jonathan Dark (Jandar) and his allies
   explores the unknown far side of the Jovian moon of Callisto (or
   Thanator), to seek and destroy Kuur, the secret stronghold of the evil
   Mind Wizards. The fleet is attacked by a flock of flying creatures
   called Zarkoons, and Jandar and the cabin boy Tomar are captured.

   Flown to the Zarkoons' lair, they meet another captive, the jungle girl
   Ylana, with whom they manage to escape. A flier piloted by Jandar's
   allies Lukor and Koja spots and retrieves them, but damaged by the
   pursuing Zarkoons it subsequently crash lands. The five find themselves
   in the Cor Az, forest home of the Cave People, Ylana's tribe, where all
   but Ylana are again imprisoned, the Cave People being under the thumb
   of the enemy. With Ylana's assistance they escape once more, only to be
   retaken and held for the Mind Wizards.

   Their ultimate fate is a mystery. An airship from the fleet later finds
   the memoir Jandar composed in captivity and hid as pursuit closed in.
   The manuscript is flown back to the civilized hemisphere of Thanator,
   whence with additional annotation it is afterwards teleported to Earth
   to become the basis of the present volume. The other three ships
   continue the quest for Kuur, but nothing has been heard from them as of
   the time of the last notation on the manuscript. With this cliffhanger
   the novel ends.
