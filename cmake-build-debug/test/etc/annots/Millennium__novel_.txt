   Millennium features a civilization that has dubbed itself "The Last
   Age". Due to millennia of warfare of every type (nineteen nuclear wars
   alone), the Earth has been heavily polluted and humanity's gene pool
   irreparably damaged. They have thus embarked on a desperate plan; time
   travel into the past, collect healthy humans, and send them to an
   uncontaminated planet to rebuild civilization.

   The time travelers can only take people that will have no further
   effect on the timeline: those who have vanished without a trace, or
   died without being observed; otherwise they would be changing the past,
   which risks a temporal paradox and perhaps even a catastrophic
   breakdown of the fabric of time. Though they collect everyone they can,
   they exert a great deal of effort on those destined to die in various
   disasters such as sinking ships and crashing airplanes (and once a
   century of Roman soldiers lost and dying in the North African desert).
   As such incidents leave no survivors to report interference and change
   the timeline, they can freely remove the living but soon-to-die
   victims, and replace them with convincing corpses they have
   manufactured in the future.

   The novel deals with several of the raids, their eventual discovery in
   the present day, and the fallout that results from changes to the
   present day reverberating into the future.

   The story follows Louise Baltimore, who is in charge of a "snatch team"
   that goes back into the past to kidnap people who would otherwise die.
   Because of the massive pollution and the genetic damage she has
   sustained, she is missing one leg and must get advanced medical
   treatment daily. Her natural appearance is quite ugly due to skin
   damage (from "paraleprosy") and other problems; however, she wears a
   special "skin suit" which makes her look whole and beautiful (which may
   or may not be real--she is an unreliable narrator), and gives her a
   functional artificial leg.

   The team she leads uses a "time gate" to appear in the bathroom aboard
   an airplane in flight. Dressed to look like flight attendants, they
   begin to bluff the passengers into entering the bathroom where they are
   pushed into the gate, to arrive in the future. After large numbers of
   people disappear, the remaining passengers become suspicious. The
   future team then uses special weapons to stun them before throwing them
   through the gate.

   During the removal of the passengers, they run into an unexpected
   hijacker. The ensuing gunplay is one-sided; one of the snatch team
   members is killed, and her stunner is lost. The rest of the team
   finishes removing the passengers and the real flight attendants. The
   team then scatters pre-burnt body parts around the plane so they will
   be found after the crash. As the plane approaches the moment when it is
   destined to crash, the lost weapon still has not been found.

   Upon returning to her present (our future), Louise is informed that the
   weapon that was left behind has caused a paradox and that it must be
   recovered to prevent a breakdown in the fabric of time.
