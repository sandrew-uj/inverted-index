   The opening sentence has been described as "immortal": "It was not
   until several weeks after he had decided to murder his wife that Doctor
   Bickleigh took any active steps in the matter."

   Edmund Bickleigh, a physician with a modest rural practice, is in a
   loveless marriage with the domineering childless Julia. He consoles
   himself with young unmarried women, in particular the accommodating
   Ivy. Into his village arrives Madeleine, a rich young woman, who
   succumbs to his attentions but warns she will not marry him if he
   divorces. Reasoning that she will however marry him if he is a widower,
   he cruelly starts to poison Julia. To relieve her increasing pain he
   gives her increasing doses of morphine, until she dies miserably.

   Madeleine then rejects him, to marry a wealthy young man, while the
   rejected Ivy also marries a well-off lawyer. Rumours start spreading
   that Julia's death was not accidental, fuelled by the antagonism
   towards Edmund of Madeleine's husband and Ivy's husband, who both
   bitterly resent that he was the seducer of their wives. Attempting to
   stop the gossip, Edmund poisons both men and Madeleine as well, though
   only Madeleine's husband dies. Not unaware of the rumours and the
   suspicious deaths, the police investigate and Edmund is put on trial.
   Acquitted of murdering his unfortunate wife, a second trial convicts
   him for the death of Madeleine's husband and he is executed.
