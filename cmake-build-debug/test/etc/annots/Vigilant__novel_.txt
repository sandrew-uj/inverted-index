   Faye Smallwood lives on the colony planet of Demoth, which humans share
   with the flying squirrel-like Oolom. During her adolescence, the Oolom
   population was nearly wiped out by a plague before her father
   discovered a cure for it; at 40, her residual survivor guilt leads her
   to join the Vigil, a Demoth-wide organization of ombudsmen. As a
   result, she finds herself enmeshed in an ancient mystery involving
   murderous androids and biological weapons.
