   The land of Dalarna is under the heel of the Vulkings, whose heavy
   taxation is forcing the Dalecarl yeomen out of their holdings. The
   protagonist, Airar Alvarson, is one of the dispossessed. On the advice
   of his mentor, the magician Meliboe, he joins the underground Iron Ring
   resistance, only to face defeat and failure. Captured and enslaved by
   the free fishers on the Gentebbi Islands, he goes through a series of
   adventures in which he gradually rises from a homeless fugitive to a
   great war leader.

   During his quest Alvarson gives much thought to the issues of honor,
   war, justice and government. He finds admirable qualities even in his
   enemies, and problematic ones in some of his allies. Always questioning
   where the right lies and what principles should guide his course, he
   feels his way to his goals as best he can. He finds magic a poor tool
   for defeating enemies or winning battles, as the small enchantments of
   which he is capable make him ill and gain him little. The great Empire
   across the sea, to which all parties pay at least a nominal fealty,
   seems to offer at least a symbolic solution; it guards the legendary
   Well of the Unicorn, which brings peace to those who drink from it. But
   its panacea is deceptive; those who do drink tend to find the peace so
   gained offset by new difficulties. The long, hard road of forging
   armies, building alliances, and waging war, without any mystical short
   cuts, proves the only effectual path.

   At the end of the novel, with the assistance of the Star-Captains of
   Carrhoene, Alvarson has succeeded in overthrowing the Vulkings and
   freeing Dalarna, and has won the emperor's daughter as his bride to
   boot. But it seems he will have no rest, as word comes that the
   heathens of Dzik have invaded the isles of his allies, the free
   fishers. When his wife urges him to drink of the Well with the
   invaders, he declines such facile solutions, countering that "There is
   no peace but that interior to us."
