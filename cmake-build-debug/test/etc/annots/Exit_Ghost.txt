   The plot centers on Zuckerman's return home to New York after eleven
   years in New England. The purpose of Zuckerman's journey, which he
   takes the week before the 2004 U.S. presidential election, is for him
   to undergo a medical procedure that might cure or reduce his
   incontinence. While in New York, Zuckerman meets Amy Bellette, whom he
   had last encountered during a visit to the writer E.I. Lonoff's house
   in December, 1956, as depicted in Roth's novel The Ghost Writer.
   Zuckerman also agrees to a housing swap with a young writing couple,
   Billy Davidoff and Jamie Logan, and quickly becomes attracted to Logan.
   In his hotel room at night, Zuckerman writes a play, He and She,
   composed of imagined conversations between him and Logan.

   Through Davidoff and Logan, Zuckerman meets Richard Kliman, a young,
   brash Harvard graduate who is working on a biography of Lonoff. Kliman
   was Logan's boyfriend in college. Because of Kliman's zealous interest
   in a potentially scandalous secret from Lonoff's adolescence, neither
   Zuckerman nor Bellette wants to help him complete his project.
   Zuckerman may also be motivated by his own confused feelings about
   Logan and Kliman.

   Although critics once considered that Lonoff, deceased and neglected,
   was modelled partly on the writer Bernard Malamud, he now seems to
   be based on a number of writers. Henry Roth is a major influence, as
   becomes clear in Exit Ghost. Roth's biographer is Steven G. Kellman. It
   is known that Philip Roth has read the later novels of Henry Roth,
   though some of these remain unpublished. The rationale for Henry Roth
   is that in his novels published after his death he reveals that he had
   an incestuous affair with his sister when he was young; it also known
   that Henry Roth suffered from writer's block for much of his career
   after publishing Call It Sleep, his only major novel. In Exit Ghost it
   is revealed that Lonoff also had an incestuous affair with his sister
   -- which led to his writer's block -- and the fact that while content
   to teach in oblivion, he never published again.

   American politics forms a backdrop to the novel. Zuckerman, Davidoff
   and Logan watch the results of the 2004 presidential election together.
   Logan, whose father always voted Republican, was enraged and devastated
   by the results. The older Zuckerman, though not pleased, was more
   philosophical and was able to place the results into a more historical
   context.
