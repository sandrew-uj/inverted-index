   Greene joined MI6 in August 1941. In London, Greene had
   been appointed to the subsection dealing with counter-espionage in the
   Iberian Peninsula, where he had learned about German agents in Portugal
   sending the Germans fictitious reports, which garnered them expenses
   and bonuses to add to their basic salary.

   One of the agents was "Garbo", a Spanish double agent in Lisbon, who
   gave his German handlers disinformation, by pretending to control a
   ring of agents all over England. In fact, he invented armed forces
   movements and operations from maps, guides and standard military
   references. Garbo was the main inspiration for Wormold, the protagonist
   of Our Man in Havana.

   Remembering the German agents in Portugal, Greene wrote the first
   version of the story in 1946, as an outline for a film script, with the
   story set in Estonia in 1938. The film was never made, and Greene soon
   realised that Havana, which he had visited several times in the early
   1950s, would be a much better setting, with the absurdities of the Cold
   War being more appropriate for a comedy.
