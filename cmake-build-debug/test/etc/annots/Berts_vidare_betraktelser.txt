   After Bert and AAke have been jumping next to the fire during Walpurgis
   Night, the Heman Hunters demonstrate on May Day, but are removed after
   singing "Tupp fick kramp uti magen, sista skiten kom daer" ("rooster
   got cramp out in its stomach, the last shit came there") to the
   Internationale tune.

   On the night between 5 and 6 May, a fire occurs in Bert's hometown,
   destroying the potato warehouse " Arnes potatislager ". The local
   police suspects arson, and Bert suspects Joergen Karlsson. Bert also
   visits his mother's sister Lena's dance institution. Paulina attends
   dancing courses there, and Bert accidentally drops Paulina into the
   floor, feeling like he is Adolf Hitler's twin brother.

   Bert's school class also visited by the 6th graders from
   Oestbergaskolan, as the classes will merge before the 7th grade, and
   Lill-Erik fears them being communists when their teacher calls them
   "comrades".

   By late May, the 6th graders go to a school camp, after collecting
   money, and as Bert walks alone in the evening Paulina appears, and
   together they walk to a former open air dance platform, where a romance
   between them takes place.

   During the 6th grade commencement at school, AAke launches his own
   firework in the school desk. The bench cover catches fire, and the
   schoolhouse is abandoned. On his way home, Bert meets Paulina, who
   wants to meet him during summer, and they soon go bathing together.

   AAke's father has met a new woman, Hillevi who has Norwegian relatives,
   and Bert goes sailing with his father and a person called Christer, but
   turns seasick.

   For Paulina's name day on 22 June Bert crochets a cloth, and as his
   caveman persona "Milton " he goes out and attaches the cloth to a
   stone, which he throws into Paulina's window. However, it falls into
   the wrong apartment, requiring Paulina's neighbour to hand over the
   present.

   Following tradition, Bert and his relatives spend Midsummer in
   Babbsand, inside a cottage located on an island. Bert's 18 years old
   cousin Sandra is bathing naked, and Bert notices his father watching it
   using binoculars, blaming it on ornithology. When Bert comes home, he
   finds a letter under the hallway carpet, where Paulina has written a
   letter telling him to come to Lilla Bryggan during Midsummer Day (when
   he was Gone).

   In July Bert's father's brother Janne, who lives in an apartment in New
   York City in the United States, has invited Bert's family to a holiday
   in Jamaica. But first, they must travel over to New York City, and the
   journey is done by aeroplane. When Bert hears of communists not being
   allowed into the USA, he turns afraid when he knows his neighbour Olle
   Collin votes for VPK. The problems turn worse when Paulina's cousin
   Pavel from Czechoslovakia, a USSR ally state, is visiting Sweden.
   Because of poor USA-USSR relations, Bert fears the USA sending agents
   into Sweden and he also fears the USA agents seeing Bert with Paulina
   and Pavel would risk Bert's entry permit to the USA. Bert thinks he
   sees USA agents inside a parked Televerket bus. Bert now must shows his
   support for the USA, and calls the embassy of the USA in Sweden,
   singing "Happy Birthday to USA", but the staff takes it for Russian
   folk songs. Bert bring the flag of the USA to McDonald's, when a
   cigar-smoking man walks by, and the flag catches fire. The local
   newspaper depicts the event as a youth communist demonstrating outside
   McDonald's by desecrating and burning the flag of the USA. The trip
   finally occurs, but when the Heman Hunters meet, AAke gives Bert a
   Swedish-Icelandic phrasebook, as AAke means most aeroplanes on their
   way to the USA have to emergency land in Iceland.

   When the Ljung family reaches the USA, Bert's father wants waitstaff to
   fill the glass to the brim (Swedish: "braedd", may sound like the
   English word "bread") when they eat at a restaurant, and when he says
   "Fill it up to the bread", waitstaff gives him a bread-piece in the
   glass. They also visit the Empire State Building. Then, they visit
   Jamaica, and during the home trip a drunk man from Finland is almost
   thrown off the aeroplane in Iceland. When Bert comes home, he receives
   postcards from AAke, who visits Norway and when they pick up their car
   at Bert's grandmother, Bert's father forgets that Sweden drives to the
   right side of the road since 1967, sending two moped riders into the
   ditches. AAke returns from Norway, meaning that a civil war between
   striped and checked people is racing. In late July, Bert and AAke sleep
   overnight inside a ghost house.

   In August, Bert spends a lot of time with his friends, before the 7th
   grade starts, including taking apples from foreign gardens. When
   bathing naked in the Noeckeln lake, Bert notices Louise being naked.
   Naked, he and Paulina hug each other. Bert also visits church secretly,
   asking God for forgiveness for thinking so much of girls.

   When Bert begins the 7th grade, his class is merged with another one
   from Oesterbergsskolan. Bert gets a locker next to Doedgraevarn, who
   fills his locker with snuffboxes, throwing away books taking too much
   place, Lill-Erik's locker ends up in the 9th graders corridor, and he
   writes a letter to the headmaster to continue the 6th grade for another
   year. Bert's class gets Banan-Boris as chemistry teacher. Banan-Boris
   takes up a water hose, spraying water at the class. In mathematics
   Agneta is their teacher, and AAke protests against home work, for
   "student democracy" and against "fascism", while Jaana throws the
   mathematics book out of the window. AAke is sent out of the classroom,
   and proposes occupation for the teachers' staffroom.

   During a floorball game during PE, Joergen Karlsson and Doedgraevarn in
   class 7 B start fighting, and after one week Bjoerna comes home to
   Bert, telling he likes Annica, and that Lena in class 7 C has "done
   it". Bjoerna also tells he has experienced a lot, but Bert realizes
   Bjoerna "lies too bad" to become a politician.

   Bert also gets a visit from Nadja, when he feels down. She gives him a
   warming hug, but Bert soon falls in love with an 8th grade girl called
   Ida, but Bert dislikes her being a smoker.

   The book ends with Bert doing his homework, and his mother says time
   has run so fast since his parents came home with him from the birthing
   center, and she wants to kiss him. Burt quickly runs into his neighbor
   Olle Collin to play the guitar.
