   Phoebe is a perfectly happy senior at high school and headed for USC
   with her best friends after graduation. Everything changes when her Mom
   comes back to California announcing she is marrying a Greek man and
   they have plans to move there. They move to a secret island where she
   is accepted to an exclusive academy for the descendants of Greek gods,
   which is run by Phoebe's new stepfather. Phoebe doesn't really fit in,
   partly because she believes she's not of holy descent. Her new
   step-sister and others easily torment her, but Phoebe ignores them. At
   the school, she quickly befriends Nicole and Troy. Phoebe makes it onto
   her cross country team, running is her natural talent. Soon after, she
   gets swept up in controversies including her, Griffin, Nicole, Troy,
   Stella, and her dead dad. At the very end of the book, Phoebe finds out
   the biggest secret of her life: Phoebe is a descendant of Nike, the
   Goddess of Victory. She then proceeds to talk to Griffin, who tells her
   he was destined to be with a descendant of Nike. They start a
   relationship together.
