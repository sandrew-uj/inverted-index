   Netherland opens on protagonist Hans van den Broek, a Dutch financial
   analyst living in London with his English wife Rachel, but quickly
   flashes back to the years Hans spent in New York City before and in the
   immediate aftermath of 9/11. At the beginning of the novel, Hans is
   preparing to return to Manhattan for the funeral of estranged friend
   Chuck Ramkissoon, who becomes the central figure of the novel. Chuck, a
   Trinidadian immigrant, guides Hans into and through the world of The
   Staten Island Cricket Club, most of whose members are also of West
   Indian or South Asian descent. Chuck is a charismatic idealist, running
   multiple (occasionally illegitimate) businesses, and making big,
   optimistic plans for the future. While Hans is swept along by Chuck's
   magnetic ardor for the American dream, Rachel moves back to London
   under the pretense of safety for their young son and ideological
   indignation over the American fixation on economic oppression. Though
   Rachel is a markedly less likeable character than Chuck, Hans
   eventually, inevitably follows her back to London. He loses touch with
   his Trinidadian friend who is discovered, years later, simply a body,
   handcuffed and disposed of in the Gowanus Canal.
