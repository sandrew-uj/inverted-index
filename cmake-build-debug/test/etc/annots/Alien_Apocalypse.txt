   Astronaut and Osteopath, Dr. Ivan Hood and his companion Kelly return
   to Earth after a 40-year space mission with two other astronauts. They
   are soon captured by human bounty hunters near the ruins of Portland,
   Oregon and one of their team is killed after sustaining a sprain; Dr.
   Hood pointed out that it would have healed in a few days. They are
   taken to a work camp, which to their surprise, is run by giant
   termite-like aliens. These aliens had arrived 20 years ago to feast on
   the wood and used E.M.P. bombs to cripple earth before their invasion.
   The other member of their team is eaten alive by one of the aliens
   after refusing to work. The camp is supervised by human bounty hunters;
   they are treated better. After seeing how illiterate and savage humans
   have become due to the aliens, Dr. Hood and Kelly plan to make an
   escape the next day after hearing rumors that the President has
   survived and has an army waiting to strike back.

   The escape plan goes off without a hitch, but Kelly is recaptured by
   the bounty hunters. Dr. Hood travels to find the president and meets
   other humans who believe the President has survived. Dr. Hood and his
   convoy reach a secret headquarters to discover remnants of the American
   government and the President, who is now a shell of his former self.
   Extremely ticked off, Dr. Hood decides to rally the escaped slaves
   himself and plan an attack on the bug camp where Kelly is still being
   held. The attack begins successfully and Kelly (who has lost one of her
   fingers as punishment for trying to escape) joins in. Things seem
   hopeless when the bugs bring in heavy artillery, but the President's
   group arrives and pulls off a sneak attack that blows up the bug's
   tanks. The other slaves join in and defeat the bugs. Dr. Hood and his
   rebels then went on a quest to continue killing the bugs and gather
   more followers from the camps. "In time he (Dr. Hood) became known as
   The Great Exterminator".
