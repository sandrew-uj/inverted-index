   The novel is primarily written from the perspective of Renisenb, a
   young widow reacquainting herself with her family when her father
   Imhotep, a successful but pompous and short-sighted mortuary priest,
   brings a new "wife", Nofret, into their lives. Nofret soon disrupts and
   antagonises Imhotep's sons - Yahmose, Sobek and Ipy - as well as their
   wives. Renisenb realises the housekeeper Henet, while feigning
   devotion, is full of hatred. She confronts Henet near the end of the
   story, who in a fit of pique admits she hates Renisenb and hated
   Renisenb's long-deceased mother.

   After Imhotep is called away, Satipy and Kait, the elder sons' wives,
   try to bully Nofret with tricks, but the plan backfires when Nofret
   appeals to Imhotep and he threatens to disown his sons and their
   families upon his return. Suddenly everyone has a motive to kill Nofret
   and when she is found dead at the foot of a cliff, an accident seems
   unlikely, although no one will acknowledge anything else.

   Next, Satipy falls to her death in terror from the same cliff while
   walking with Yahmose. Renisenb, and others, wonder if it was Nofret's
   vengeful spirit that she was looking at over Yahmose's shoulder moments
   before her death. This theory gathers force when Yahmose and Sobek
   drink poisoned wine. Sobek dies, but Yahmose lingers on, having drunk
   less of the wine. A slave boy who says he saw Nofret's ghost poisoning
   the wine dies of poison shortly afterwards.

   The handsome scribe Kameni has fallen in love with Renisenb, and
   eventually asks her to marry him. Unsure whether she loves him or her
   father's advisor Hori, whom she has known since she was a child, she
   leaves the choice effectively in her father's hands and becomes engaged
   to Kameni. She realises, however, that his relationship with Nofret was
   closer than she had supposed, and that jealousy may have influenced
   Nofret's bitter hatred towards the family. Hori and Esa, the elderly
   mother of Imhotep (a clever woman who although almost completely blind
   sees things clearer than most others - especially her son) begin to
   investigate the possibility of a human murderer. Ipy, himself a likely
   suspect, starts to boast about his new, better position with his
   father; he plots to get rid of housekeeper Henet and tells her so. The
   next morning, Ipy is found dead in the lake, drowned.

   The field of suspects has been further narrowed. Esa attempts to flush
   out the murderer by dropping a hint about the death of Satipy, but is
   herself murdered by means of poisoned unguent, despite the presence of
   a food taster. Henet - who knows the murderer's identity and is
   momentarily powerful amid the chaos - is smothered by the linens used
   to wrap the ever-increasing number of victims.

   On the same cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb,
   apparently summoned by Hori, hears footsteps behind her and turns to
   see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her
   brother's eyes that Satipy saw before she was killed. As Renisenb is
   about to be killed, however, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves
   her. Hori explains to Renisenb that Satipy was not looking in fear at
   anything beyond Yahmose -- she was looking straight at him. He had
   consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while
   committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his
   newfound love of violence. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry:
   Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and
   more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori's arms.
