   While recovering from his addictions, Paracha spent time rearranging
   these notes using the cut-up method and surrealist automatism.

   He then turned it all into a work of fiction in which a heroin addict
   narrates his story set in future Pakistan and India that have turned
   into capitalist and theistic dystopias.

   He is a traveler who is always moving up and down both the countries
   looking for drugs and in the process having hallucinatory dialogues
   with a Pakistani cleric/Islamic extremist (called in the book as "The
   Mufti"), a group of Hindu fundamentalists (called "The pundits"), a
   group of young neoliberals (referred to as "the fun young people" and
   the "polite voids"), and an aging Indian Christian (called the "Holy
   Father").

   There are also many other characters, but much of the story revolves
   around these main characters as Paracha constructs his dystopia in
   which capitalism and organized religion have been fused together as a
   new totalitarian system.

   Acidity makes a clear comment this way on the rapid economic, political
   and social changes taking place in India and Pakistan, especially after
   the end of the Cold War.
