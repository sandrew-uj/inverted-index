   In Saint Petersburg, Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin works as a titular
   councillor (rank 9 in the Table of Ranks established by Peter the
   Great.), a low-level bureaucrat struggling to succeed.

   Golyadkin has a formative discussion with his Doctor Rutenspitz, who
   fears for his sanity and tells him that his behaviour is dangerously
   antisocial. He prescribes "cheerful company" as the remedy. Golyadkin
   resolves to try this, and leaves the office. He proceeds to a birthday
   party for Klara Olsufyevna, the daughter of his office manager. He was
   uninvited, and a series of faux pas lead to his expulsion from the
   party. On his way home through a snowstorm, he encounters a man who
   looks exactly like him, his double. The following two thirds of the
   novel then deals with their evolving relationship.

   At first, Golyadkin and his double are friends, but Golyadkin Jr.
   proceeds to attempt to take over Sr.'s life, and they become bitter
   enemies. Because Golyadkin Jr. has all the charm, unctuousness and
   social skills that Golyadkin Sr. lacks, he is very well-liked among the
   office colleagues. At the story's conclusion, Golyadkin Sr. begins to
   see many replicas of himself, has a psychotic break, and is dragged off
   to an asylum by Doctor Rutenspitz.
