   Danlo (Danlo wi Soli Ringess) is a human child living among a tribe of
   Neanderthal like beings living in the mountainous island Kweitkel, on
   the Planet Icefall. Danlo's tribe is called the Devaki. The Devaki
   belong to a group of tribes called the Alaloi, who settled on the
   planet. Seeking a simple life, the Alaloi transformed their genetic
   makeup to look like Neanderthals at the time of settlement on Icefall.

   However, all the Devaki die of a mysterious disease. Only Danlo and
   another Alaloi called Soli (or Three Fingered Soli) survive the
   disease. Soli performs the Devaki rite for passing into manhood on
   Danlo, a mutilation of his penis via circumcision followed by continued
   mutilation of his member that creates colored strands on it and the
   choosing of the animal spirit. Danlo chooses Ahira, which is otherwise
   called the White Thallow. The White Thallow is actually a snowy owl.
   However, the rite exhausts Soli and he dies. Before his death, Soli
   tells Danlo about his true father and mother from the Unreal City
   (Neverness).

   Soli informs Danlo that he is actually Danlo's grandfather, Leopold
   Soli. Danlo's mother, father and Soli were humans on a scientific
   mission among the Alaloi, who had physically carked (not genetically
   transformed, but changed through surgery) their bodies to look like the
   Alaloi. Danlo's Mother, Katherine, was murdered 40 days before Danlo
   was due to be born. Danlo was cut from her womb, because his mother was
   accused of being a "satinka" (witch). Danlo's father (Mallory Ringess)
   fled back to Neverness, returning only once to the Alaloi. Soli stayed
   among the Devaki. Soli also tells of exploding stars in a region of
   space called the Vild. He instructs Danlo to travel through the
   snow-covered land to the city of Neverness, which lies to the east of
   Kweitkel.

   Danlo makes the perilous journey across the ice during the winter -
   facing snow storms, dwindling supplies and dying sled dogs - and makes
   it to Neverness. He is frostbitten and hungry, starved and has grown
   thin to the bones.

   On reaching Neverness he starts to look for food and encounters a group
   of men and women along with an alien, who do not understand Danlo's
   Alaloi language. He is taken into the house of the alien, a member of
   the Fravashi race. Neverness is the center of the galactic civilization
   and is home to many different alien races and the Fravashi are one
   among them. The Fravashi who took in Danlo is called the Old Father.
   The Fravashi are a race of intelligent beings who like to think and
   teach others to think. The Old Father is a teacher and the men and
   women are his students. They nurse Danlo back to health and cure his
   frostbite. The Old Father presents Danlo with a Shakuhachi (Japanese
   end-blown flute). While Danlo regains his strength the Old Father
   learns how to speak the Alaloi language.
