   Willis' mythos is a near future, first introduced in her story "Fire
   Watch" (1982), in which historians conduct field work by traveling into
   the past as observers. The research is conducted at the University of
   Oxford, in mid-21st century England.^[5]

   In the book's fictional universe, history resists time travel that
   would cause the past to be altered, by preventing visits to certain
   places or times. Typically the machine used for time travel will refuse
   to function, rendering the trip impossible. In other cases, "slippage",
   a shift in the exact time target, occurs. The time-traveler arrives at
   the nearest place-and-time suitable for preventing a paradox; variance
   can be anything from 5 minutes to 5 years. Some periods theoretically
   accessible can also be deemed too dangerous for the historians by the
   authorities controlling time travel.^[5]
