   The bulk of the book focuses on a British writer, Nathan, who is
   attempting to sell an idea for a claustrosphere commercial to Plastic
   Tolstoy, owner and chief marketer of the company which builds them. The
   commercial represents a change in emphasis for the advertising
   campaign; up to now claustropheres have been sold as a kind of
   fall-back insurance, just in case the environment collapses. However,
   now that virtually everybody owns at least a basic model, sales are
   falling and the company is having to try and sell upgrade and
   improvement packages instead. The new advertising, therefore, attempts
   to convince people for the first time that the environment truly is
   doomed and they are inevitably going to have to live in their
   claustrospheres.

   Tolstoy accepts Nathan's idea and assigns him to work with Max, a
   shallow and pretentious young actor. During a subsequent meeting with
   Tolstoy, Nathan makes a joking suggestion that it would be ironic if
   his company actually covertly sponsored the eco-terrorism movement led
   by Jurgen Thor, which despises the claustrosphere company since it
   represents, in their eyes, an abrogation of mankind's responsibility to
   care for the environment. Nathan is subsequently murdered as he plays a
   virtual reality game with Max. Max sets out to investigate the murder,
   falling in with Rosalie Connolly, an eco-terrorist working for Thor's
   organization.

   Max ultimately discovers that Thor and Tolstoy are in fact partners.
   The eco-terrorists raids, whilst highly successful, never present more
   than a minor problem to the vast claustrosphere company, but do grab
   headlines and bring awareness of the looming eco-disaster into the
   public mind - prompting them to buy more claustrospheres. Tolstoy
   confesses that he has even geared his advertising campaign to work in
   perfect sync with the terrorists, with new commercials ready to roll
   out instantly after each attack.

   After a confrontation between Max, Rosalie and Jurgen in which Jurgen
   is killed, Tolstoy decides to evade justice by leaking news indicating
   that the ecology is finally collapsing. The news is suddenly full of
   stories of environmental catastrophe, and people are told that they
   need to lock themselves in their claustrospheres for several decades.
   The "rat run", as it is termed, removes the large bulk of humanity from
   the world, effectively ending the current civilization.
