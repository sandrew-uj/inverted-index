   Jim finds Danny alive as the book opens but the living dead soon
   converge on their location. Frankie and Martin join Jim in the house
   and they are soon trapped in the attic. As they see Danny's neighbor in
   his panic room across the way the zombies set fire to the house. They
   rig a ladder between the two houses and everyone but Frankie makes it
   across, Frankie however has a two-story fall into a swimming pool
   below. Meanwhile: Don, Martin, Jim, and Danny regroup and make a run
   for Don's Ford explorer. Upon escaping the garage they find Frankie
   fighting zombies in the front yard badly hurt from the fall and shot
   several times. They rescue her as she goes into shock.

   Back in Hellertown Ob has taken Baker's body and is instructing his
   minions to make a motor pool from all the abandoned vehicles. Ob is
   distressed that Jim is alive and escaping him, he begins to fantasize
   killing Martin and Jim. Here he divulges that the Sissquim can see the
   life auras coming from the living. Ob is then killed by some hiding
   guardsmen who he discovers.

   Their escape is short lived as Frankie left the keys in the Humvee and
   the zombies are in hot pursuit. They use the Humvee to force the car
   into an accident. Jim regains consciousness as zombies are trying to
   pull Danny from the wreckage and biting his arm. Jim loses it and
   violently kills the zombie, punctuating each blow with the words "I
   told you to leave my son alone." Martin has been thrown from the car
   and his head had turned a full 180 degrees around. Jim smashes his head
   in with a rock as he reanimates proclaiming "There is no God". Jim
   leads the zombies away distracting them from his party including a very
   badly injured Frankie making plans to meet them in what looks like an
   abandoned parking structure. There is a legless zombie hiding in a car
   who alerts more zombies to the groups presence. Jim races back to the
   structure as the group races for the roof. Almost simultaneously a
   helicopter shows up using a powerful sonic device that kills all the
   zombie birds and almost kills Jim. They rescue Jim and take him to
   Ramsey towers.

   Ob reanimates in a new body that is in great shape. His host died of a
   heart attack while masturbating. His old host had knowledge of secret
   armories for the NYPD as well as the National Guard. He uses this
   knowledge to help arm his army as he sends for his forces in Hellertown
   as well as across the country. He also learns that all human life in
   Europe and Asia has been eliminated.

   Ob then lays siege to last remaining humans holed up in Ramsey towers,
   using heavy artillery he is able to breach the supposedly impenetrable
   building. With the approaching forces the remaining humans are falling
   apart as the zombies storm the towers and eradicate them. Jim, Frankie,
   and a few others escape into the sewers only to be followed by Ob and
   his forces. Three of the company are killed by Zombie rats, one of a
   gunshot wound, one eaten by a zombie crocodile, and one having his
   throat slit by another zombie. Ob personally confronts Jim telling him
   he is glad to be the one ending his incredible journey; Jim then uses a
   flamethrower on a gas line killing Ob and the surrounding zombies.
   Frankie and Danny are eventually killed by zombie rats in their sleep.

   Sometime before the final act however, Frankie has a dream in which the
   spirit of Martin talks to her, laying out the complex plan set up by Ob
   and his minions. The plan shows her that surviving the zombies would
   have been just the first ordeal. The undead were merely the first wave,
   with the purpose of eliminating all human and animal life. Once that
   task is accomplished, other demons would begin the assimilation of the
   plants and insects. It is also revealed that Jim, Danny and the rest of
   the characters from the books are reunited in some sort of afterlife
   and are happy.
