   Gus, a young boy with deer features, lives a quiet life deep in the
   woods with his father. He learns many things, from medical care to
   religious prophecy. Though he loves his religious father, he yearns to
   escape as he learns that there is not fire past the trees, but simply
   more land.

   Sometime after Gus' father passes from an illness, strange men come to
   capture him. They are slain by Jepperd, who then promises to take Gus
   to a sanctuary. Lonely, Gus goes with him. Along the way, they
   encounter many problems. Hybrid cultists almost kill Jepperd but Gus
   saves him. 'Sweet Tooth' then earns his nickname by eating all of
   Jepperd's candy/food stash though he had gained more food while Jepperd
   recovered. The duo also rescue several women from a prostitution ring.

   Ultimately, Jepperd betrays Gus to a horrible scientific facility in
   return for the remains of his wife. It turns out a mysterious plague
   has been wiping out humanity, and the leader of the facility, Abbot,
   along with scientist Dr. Singh, believe the half-animal half-human
   children hybrids have something to do with it. In flashback we learn
   Jepperd was a former hockey bruiser who protected his wife Louise in
   the post apocalyptic world. Eventually though, Louise revealed she was
   pregnant and Jepperd relents when a militia, led by Abbot, offers
   protection. It was all a trick however, with Abbot and Singh
   experimenting on pregnant women and hybrid babies to try to find a cure
   for the plague. Jepperd is kept in a cage but is eventually freed by
   Abbot's brother Johnny, a guard in the facility. Johnny tells Jepperd
   his wife is dead, and Jepperd goes on a rampage through the facility.
   He is recaptured, and Abbot lets him out of the camp, telling him he
   can have his wife's remains if he brings Abbot a hybrid child. This was
   why Jepperd betrayed Gus, and he heads home to fulfill a promise to his
   wife that he would "bring her back home".

   Gus, despite the horrors, makes friends with the last of the animal
   children at the place, the pig girl Wendy, half feral groundhog boy
   Bobby, and the silent donkey boy Buddy. Gus is hypnotized by Dr Singh,
   who goes deep into his memory to find out the truth about his birth. He
   discovers that Gus's father was a lunatic, and may even have been
   responsible for the apocalypse. He insists Abbot take him to the woods.
   They discover a bible that was written by Gus's father, but no evidence
   of a mother in her grave, on the way back to the camp, Singh starts to
   believe the writings. Jepperd, overwhelmed with guilt and a
   directionless life, decides to re-rescue Gus. He recruits Becky and
   Lucy, the women he saved, and hundreds of hybrid cultists. With help
   from Johnny, the children escape, although Gus is forced to kill a lost
   alligator-child who had gone feral. While on the move, Jepperd and Gus
   share an identical dream about Alaska.

   A battle and the intervention of Johnny allow Jepperd and the women to
   escape with the children and Dr Singh, who insists on coming.
   Seemingly, Buddy is lost to the murderous attentions of the hybrid
   cultists... and at the same time seems to think Jepperd is his father.
   Despite the emotional turmoil, the group closes ranks to protect the
   children still with them. Buddy is taken by Abbot who murders the head
   cultist to do so. Somehow, the headmaster is now friendly and
   sympathetic towards the injured, moaning boy. Gus, Jepperd, Becky,
   Lucy, Wendy, Bobby, Johnny, and Singh stumble across a mysterious dam.
