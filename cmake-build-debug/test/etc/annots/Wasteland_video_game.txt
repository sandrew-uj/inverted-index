   In 2087 (one hundred years after the game's development), generations
   after the devastation of a global nuclear war in 1998, a distant
   remnant force of the U.S. Army called the Desert Rangers is based in
   the Southwestern United States, acting as peacekeepers to protect
   fellow survivors and their descendants. A team of Desert Rangers is
   assigned to investigate a series of disturbances in nearby areas.
   Throughout the game, the rangers explore the remaining enclaves of
   human civilization, including a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas.

   As the group's investigation deepens, the Rangers discover evidence of
   a larger menace threatening to exterminate what is left of humankind. A
   pre-war artificial intelligence operating from a surviving military
   facility, Base Cochise, is constructing armies of killer machines and
   cybernetically modified humans to attack human settlements with the
   help of Irwin Finster, the deranged former commander of the base.
   Finster has gone so far as to transform himself into a cyborg under the
   AI's control. The AI's ultimate goal is to complete "Project Darwin"
   (which Finster was in charge of) and replace the world's "flawed"
   population with genetically pure specimens. With help from a pre-war
   android named Max, the player recovers the necessary technology and
   weapons in order to confront the AI at Base Cochise and destroy it by
   making the base's nuclear reactor melt down.
