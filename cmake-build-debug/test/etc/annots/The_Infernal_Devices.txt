   The series takes place in London England in 1878, a short time after
   the peace treaties between Downworlders and Shadowhunters. As
   Shadowhunters consider themselves superior or purer than Downworlders
   or demons, they may have no qualms about killing either.

   The first book in The Infernal Devices is entitled Clockwork Angel and
   begins the story of Tessa Gray, an orphan teenage girl who is looking
   for her brother Nathaniel Gray, who has disappeared, and seeks her true
   identity.

   Her search plunges her into a world she never knew existed, and reveals
   talents she never knew she had. She will have to learn to master them
   if she wants to find her brother, and must forge an alliance with
   Shadowhunters if she wants to survive in this dangerous world. Many of
   the family names of the Shadowhunters used in The Mortal Instruments
   are first introduced in this series. Another character in The Infernal
   Devices, Magnus Bane, the High Warlock of Brooklyn, also plays a part
   in the series.

   As Tessa Gray is drawn deeper into the Shadow world, and goes on the
   quest of finding her brother, she falls in love with two
   Shadowhunters-but when it comes to choosing one, trouble begins to brew
   and suspense finds its way into her life. She will have to learn to
   hide her feelings if she hopes to survive. However, as her heart rages
   for love but her mind is bent on saving her brother, will she hide her
   vulnerable side? Which of the Shadowhunters will win her heart?
