   Both America and Russia plan manned missions to the Moon to examine the
   wreckage of the structures destroyed in The Domes of Pico. The American
   astronaut, Morrison Kant, breaks his leg shortly before takeoff, so
   Chris Godfrey steps in. Both spacecraft arrive at the same time. Unlike
   Chris Godfrey, the Russian pilot, Serge Smyslov, is unable to leave his
   Lunar Rover vehicle and both head for the wrecked domes, leading to a
   tense standoff...

   The book predates the first use of a Lunar Rover by 11 years.
