   Narrated by the disembodied spirit or consciousness of Pilgermann, a
   European Jew, the novel opens with the newly castrated Pilgermann
   having a vision of Christ after sleeping with a merchant's wife and
   subsequently being mutilated by a gentile mob. Christ tells Pilgermann
   that he must make his way to Jerusalem where he will meet with Sophia.
   Reluctantly, and in theory with nothing better to do, Pilgermann sets
   off.

   As Pilgermann travels across Europe he is joined by other characters,
   including his own Death which walks alongside him. Life in Europe is
   seen through a series of grotesque, Brueghel- and Bosch-like images of
   horror, violence, degradation and death. Nevertheless, Pilgermann
   continues, keeping his cool with a mixture of detachment, compassion
   and irony throughout.

   Halfway across the Mediterranean his boat is ambushed by pirates who
   sell him to a Muslim grandee in Antioch in Syria, Bembel Redzuk.
   Pilgermann and Bembel become friends, although never social equals (as
   a Jew Pilgermann can only ever be a dhimmi in Muslim society).
   Pilgermann conceives of, designs and builds an enormous Kabbalistic
   courtyard and tower with a patterned design on the floor for Bembel
   which rapidly takes on numinous power among the community, attracting
   the displeasure of the Islamic authorities. Things come to a head when
   Frankish crusaders besiege Antioch. As it becomes increasingly clear
   that the city will fall, the Islamic authorities become more and more
   suspicious of non-Muslims and Pilgermann's life becomes increasingly
   threatened. Finally the city falls and Bembel and Pilgermann are killed
   fighting a crusader, but not before Pilgermann has a vision of
   Jerusalem - which he is never destined to get to - and sees Sophia
   lying, dying among a pile of corpses after a crusader massacre.
