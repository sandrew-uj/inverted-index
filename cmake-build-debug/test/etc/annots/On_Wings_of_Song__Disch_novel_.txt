   The novel takes place in suburban Iowa and in New York City, around the
   middle of the 21st century. Its first section describes the childhood
   and adolescence of Daniel Weinreb, an imaginative boy who manages to
   adapt well to his conservative surroundings until a minor act of
   rebellion sends him to prison at age 14. Daniel's experience there
   makes him eager to leave the Midwest. After falling in love with the
   daughter of a powerful and reactionary local tycoon, he moves with her
   to New York, dreaming of becoming a musician and exploring the
   forbidden art of "flying"--electronically-assisted astral projection.
   Tragedy and exploitation leave Daniel's idealism in ruins, but he
   persists and becomes an internationally famous and controversial
   performer.

   Alongside this Bildungsroman storyline, the novel presents a detailed
   portrait of a future United States torn by economic hardship and
   culture war. The Midwestern Farm Belt states are ruled by a coalition
   of the Christian right, known as "undergoders" (a reference to the
   successful conservative campaign to add the words "under God" to the
   Pledge of Allegiance); the nominally secular government is socially
   repressive and business-friendly to an extreme. The coastal states more
   closely resemble present-day urban America, with generally permissive
   social attitudes and artistic ferment, but great economic inequality.

   The invention of "flying" (which has happened at some unspecified point
   prior to the beginning of the novel, and is never described in any
   technological detail) aggravates these cultural divisions. By using a
   device that seems to be based on biofeedback, while singing with
   particular verve (an action that, as Disch suggests, causes unique
   integration of brain activity), a practitioner can separate mind from
   body and roam the world as an invisible "fairy", able to travel almost
   without restriction and perceive hidden things. The undergoders regard
   this as a sinful and dangerous practice, so much so that they
   discourage musical performance of any kind; but in the coastal cities
   flying is a fad, so popular that singers are afraid to admit not having
   been able to achieve it. Many Americans simply refuse to believe that
   such a radical escape is possible and claim that flying is a
   hallucination, but still take precautions to avoid being observed by
   "fairies".
