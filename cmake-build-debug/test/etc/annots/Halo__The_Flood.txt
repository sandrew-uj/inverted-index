   The novel, like the video game it is based on, begins as the Pillar of
   Autumn exits slipspace, discovering an unexpected massive ringworld
   hidden by a moon in orbit around a gas giant. In the system are a host
   of Covenant, who notice the lone ship. A Covenant leader forbids the
   fleet to fire on the Autumn, for fear of damaging the ring. Instead,
   they board and capture the ship. Meanwhile, technicians on the Autumn
   prepare for battle and awaken a single soldier from cryo sleep--a
   Spartan known as the Master Chief.

   The Covenant board the Autumn; deprived of defensive options, the
   Autumn's captain, Jacob Keyes, tells the crew to abandon ship. The
   Master Chief is entrusted with the artificial intelligence Cortana;
   given the wealth of tactical information the A.I. contains, Keyes
   cannot allow Cortana to fall into enemy hands. The Master Chief leaves
   for the surface of Halo in a lifeboat; other soldiers, including a
   squad of shock troops led by Antonio Silva and his second-in-command,
   Melissa McKay, land by special drop pods, and take a strategic bluff
   from the Covenant to use as a base of operations. Captain Keyes is
   captured by the Covenant, and taken aboard the Covenant cruiser Truth
   and Reconciliation; the Master Chief and a squad of Marines board the
   Truth and Reconciliation, rescuing the captain. Keyes has learned that
   the ringworld they are on has vast significance to the Covenant- they
   believe that "Halo", as they call the ring, is a weapon of unimaginable
   power. Escaping from the Covenant cruiser, Keyes gives the Master Chief
   the mission of finding the Control Room of Halo before the Covenant.
   The Master Chief and Cortana discover the location of the Control Room,
   and with the help of some Marines, insert Cortana into Halo's computer
   network. However, Cortana realizes that the ring is not a weapon as
   they understood at all- but before the Chief can press her with
   questions, Cortana tells the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes.

   Dropped into the swamp where Keyes and his squad disappeared, the
   Master Chief discovers that the Captain has been captured and both
   human and Covenant soldiers have been turned into zombie-like creatures
   by bulbous aliens. One soldier, Private Wallace Jenkins, is left still
   semi-conscious and painfully aware of his predicament, unable to
   control his movement or actions as his former friends and he attack
   McKay's troops. Jenkins intends on ending his life, but is instead
   captured by McKay for study. The Chief is approached by Halo's resident
   A.I., 343 Guilty Spark, who informs the Chief that the creatures he has
   encountered are called the Flood, a virulent parasite that infects
   hosts and converts them into either forms for combat, or for
   reproduction. To activate Halo's defenses, Guilty Spark needs the
   Master Chief's help. In Halo's Control Room, Guilty Spark gives the
   Master Chief the key to activate Halo, but is stopped by a furious
   Cortana. Cortana explains that Halo is a weapon, but it doesn't kill
   the Flood- it kills their food, meaning humans, Covenant, and any other
   sentient life. Realizing that they have to stop Guilty Spark from
   activating Halo, Cortana and the Master Chief decide to destroy Halo by
   detonating the crash-landed Pillar of Autumn's fusion reactors. In
   order to do this, they need Captain Keyes' neural implants. Cortana
   discovers the Captain is still alive, held prisoner once again aboard
   the Truth and Reconciliation, now in the hands of the Flood who are
   trying to escape Halo. The Chief fights Covenant and Flood to the
   Captain, but finds out he is too late--the Captain has been assimilated
   into the parasite. The Chief retrieves the implants and leaves the
   Truth for the Autumn.

   While the Chief and Cortana head to the Autumn, Alpha Base is
   evacuated. Silva decides to retake the Truth and Reconciliation and
   pilot the ship away in order to avoid being on Halo when the Autumn
   blows. The ship is taken successfully, but McKay realizes that Silva is
   blinded by the thought of promotion and glory to the danger of the
   Flood; if even one Flood specimen escaped containment on Earth, the
   entire planet could fall. Jenkins draws McKay's attention to a vital
   energy line on the ship, and realizing that the destruction of the
   Flood is more important than Silva's promotion, cuts the cable, sending
   the Truth and Reconciliation crashing into Halo, killing all aboard.

   At the Autumn, the Master Chief is forced to destabilize the fusion
   reactors manually as 343 Guilty Spark and his robotic drones try to
   stop them. Once the countdown until detonation has begun, Cortana
   directs the Chief to a fighter still docked in the Pillar of Autumn
   hangar. Gunning the engines, the Chief and Cortana escape the ring just
   as the Autumn explodes, ending the threat of the Flood. Cortana scans
   for survivors and realizes that they are seemingly the only two who
   have survived. Cortana tells the Master Chief that the fight is
   finished, to which the Chief replies, "No. The Covenant is still out
   there, and Earth is at risk. We're just getting started."
