   A diplomatic mission to the matriarchal planet New Amazonia reunites
   ex-lovers Vincent Katherinessen and Michelangelo Kusanagi-Jones after a
   separation of 17 years. Arriving in the capital city of Penthesilea,
   the men are ostensibly repatriating looted artwork, but in truth the
   ambassador-spies have been tasked with obtaining the Amazonians' secret
   energy technology by any means necessary, and doing what they can to
   facilitate a Coalition conquest. However, both Vincent (a master of
   observation) and Angelo (a trained liar and fighter) each have hidden
   plans to undermine their own mission. Meanwhile, multiple factions
   among the Amazonians are engaged in covert political intrigues rooted
   in the gender dynamics of their society.^[1]^[2]^[3]
