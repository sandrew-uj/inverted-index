   In a world recently overtaken by a virus that turns people rabid within
   48 hours, Andy Rose, his wife Kay, and their baby Rosie are traveling
   down a river on a houseboat in rural Australia. Short on government
   rations, Kay suggests going ashore and scavenging for food in the
   nearest town, but Andy rejects this, arguing it would be safer to
   remain on the river until they reach their destination, a supposed
   refuge. The next day, Andy searches an abandoned sailboat alone and
   retrieves some supplies, but hastily leaves when it becomes apparent
   something else is aboard. Andy shows Kay his haul, but does not tell
   her about the danger, and when she ventures out to collect more, she is
   bitten by a rabid human.

   When Andy finds Kay trying to bandage the bite wound, he insists on
   taking her to a hospital since she would bleed out long before
   succumbing to the virus. The Rose family disembarks, restarts an
   abandoned car, and sets out toward what their map indicates is a large
   town, but they swerve to avoid an Aboriginal man standing in the road
   and crash. Kay is impaled and Andy faints; When he wakes, Kay has
   already turned and then bites him. Andy removes Rosie from the car and
   prepares to defend himself against the man, who is also turned, but a
   girl named Thoomi appears and reveals that the man is her father,
   Willie Bell. Thoomi has been hiding Willie from her mother, Josie, and
   the rest of her community because the Aboriginals have been killing and
   burning the infected, and she believes her father can be cured by
   having a shaman restore his soul.

   Andy reaches the town, but it is much smaller than expected and
   deserted apart from Etta, a schoolteacher who takes care of him and
   Rosie for the night. Etta explains that all of her students and their
   families, most of them Aboriginals, have discarded modern trappings and
   gone back to the old ways; she warns Andy to hide his bite mark. Andy
   wakes later than planned the next morning after experiencing his first
   seizure from the virus. When Andy and Rosie leave, Etta shows them a
   picture of Thoomi and her parents and tells Andy to find them and leave
   Rosie in their care.

   Andy frees a man named Vic who is pinned under some gas cylinders, and
   Vic takes him to his shelter and introduces Lorraine, whom Andy assumes
   is Vic's wife. Andy learns that Vic uses healthy humans in cages as
   bait, one of whom is Thoomi, to lure out the infected so he can shoot
   them. That night, Andy attempts suicide, believing Rosie will be cared
   for by Vic and Lorraine, but Lorraine stops him and reveals that she is
   not Vic's wife, but his captive, and Vic murdered her real husband. Vic
   discovers them and knocks Andy out, and he awakens in the same cage as
   Thoomi. They help each other escape by using the combined force of many
   infected to pull open their cage; they return to the shelter,
   rendezvousing with Lorraine and Rosie. Vic shoots at them as they
   escape, and inadvertently kills Lorraine.

   The following morning, Andy upsets Thoomi when he tells her that he and
   her father will not get better. She runs to where she had been hiding
   her father, but finds her people had already discovered Willie and put
   him down. Initially distraught and blaming Andy for delaying her,
   Thoomi relents and rejoins him when she hears Rosie crying. They travel
   by motorboat to a campsite where Andy previously saw another family,
   but learn that the father has been bitten and plans to kill his family
   and himself with a revolver. The father tells Andy to use the gun's
   last two bullets on himself and Rosie. When the family is dead, Andy
   takes up the gun and debates whether to go through with suicide, but is
   stopped by Thoomi. They then notice smoke nearby and move to
   investigate.

   As the trio pass through a railway tunnel, they re-encounter Vic.
   Thoomi hides with Rosie inside a parked vehicle on the tracks, while
   Andy and Vic fight. During the struggle, Vic manages to grab the
   revolver and wound Andy with a shot, then goes after Thoomi and Rosie.
   When Andy recovers, he finds Vic cradling Rosie and weeping over the
   loss of Lorraine. Vic peacefully returns Rosie to Andy and allows them
   and Thoomi to leave.

   Later, Andy enters the final throes of infection. With his time almost
   gone, Andy asks Thoomi to look after Rosie. He and Thoomi prepare for
   his turning by binding his hands and preparing a piece of meat on a
   stick, which Thoomi uses to bait him once he has turned. In this
   manner, Thoomi uses Andy to carry her and Rosie safely on his back.
   They eventually catch up to a party of Aboriginal warriors that
   includes Thoomi's mother, who recognizes Thoomi's whistle. Reunited
   with her people and with Rosie safe from harm, Thoomi allows a warrior
   to put Andy out of his misery. The party then return to a camp deep in
   the wilderness, where Thoomi and Josie inspect Rosie for injury, and
   find Andy had painted the words "Thank You" on her stomach.
