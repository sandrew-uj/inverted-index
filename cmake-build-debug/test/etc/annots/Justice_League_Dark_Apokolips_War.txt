   Following his two failed attempts at conquering Earth, Darkseid
   and his armies continue conquering other worlds. The Justice League
   devise a plan to defeat Darkseid by taking his war to Apokolips while
   leaving the Teen Titans on Earth to defend it. Unbeknownst to them,
   Darkseid spies on the League through Cyborg, now knowing their plan. As
   a result, the League are overwhelmed and defeated by Paradooms--genetic
   hybrid creatures made from Parademons and Doomsday--and a majority of
   the heroes from both the League and the Titans are killed during the
   fight, whereas those who survive are placed into Darkseid's slavery.

   Two years after his successful conquest of Earth, Darkseid has placed
   devices known as "Reapers" which mine the planet's core. The surviving
   heroes blame Clark Kent / Superman for leading them into failure.
   Following the failed assault, Superman has been forcibly depowered
   after Darkseid tattooed his chest with liquid kryptonite. He and Raven,
   who has been struggling to maintain her father Trigon's imprisonment[N
   2] as a result of her depression due to losing most of her teammates
   during Darkseid's attack, seek John Constantine for a location spell to
   track Damian Wayne. Although reluctant to help at first, considering
   himself a coward for fleeing during the initial attack on Darkseid and
   leaving his lover Zatanna to die, Constantine locates Damian at a
   League of Assassins outpost where the group are briefly attacked by
   assassins who are then called off by Damian, now their leader. Clark
   explains to Damian they need him to help break his father Batman free
   from Darkseid's mind control. Damian then reluctantly agrees to join
   the group.

   The group travel to Stryker's Island in Metropolis and meet with
   Clark's wife Lois Lane who has recruited the Suicide Squad to their
   cause, now led by Harley Quinn. Clark and Lois reveal their plan
   to infiltrate LexCorp and use the boom tube located there to return to
   Apokolips and kill Darkseid once and for all. Meanwhile, as a
   distraction, the remaining heroes launch an attack on the Reapers but
   are slowly killed battling the Paradooms. At the building, they are
   confronted by Lex Luthor, who reveals he was a mole working with Lois
   to gain intel on Darkseid. From there, the group split into two with
   Clark, Raven, Constantine, and Etrigan the Demon going to Apokolips and
   Lois, Luthor, and the Squad remaining at the building to defend the
   boom tube. Batman informs Darkseid of Luthor's betrayal, prompting
   Batman to send Paradooms and the newly converted mechanical Furies
   after the heroes.

   Upon arrival, Clark's group is attacked by the Furies, consisting of
   Wonder Woman, Mera, Hawkman, Starfire and Martian Manhunter. Etrigan is
   killed but Constantine manages to break Wonder Woman free using her
   Lasso of Truth. She then decides to stay behind to fend off the other
   Furies as the group head on. They next rescue The Flash from a
   treadmill powering Apokolips. While freeing the Flash, however,
   Constantine discovers he had altered the timeline in the past.
   Shortly thereafter they are confronted by Cyborg who has been
   integrated into the planet's network. Constantine frees Cyborg from
   Darkseid's control, which also frees the remaining Furies right as they
   are about to overpower Wonder Woman. Batman and Darkseid return.
   Darkseid orders Batman to kill Damian but he hesitates when he is
   reminded of his parents' death, which breaks him free of Darkseid's
   mind control. In a fit of rage, Darkseid tries to kill Batman but his
   attack is intercepted by Damian whose death triggers Raven, her sudden
   emotional instability setting Trigon free. Constantine offers his body
   as a vessel for Trigon but he refuses and takes Clark's body instead,
   purging the kryptonite from his body, restoring his powers, and killing
   Constantine. Trigon attacks Darkseid. Constantine is briefly visited by
   Zatanna in the afterlife who reveals she used a spell to manipulate
   Constantine to flee back to Earth as part of a contingency plan
   prepared by Batman should the League fail. Simultaneously, Raven and
   Zatanna revive Damian and Constantine.

   Back at LexCorp, Lois' team is surrounded by Paradooms, prompting them
   to initiate a self-destruct. Before the self-destruct, Lois transmits a
   goodbye message to Apokolips with Cyborg's assistance. Her death shocks
   Clark back to his senses and frees him from Trigon's possession.
   Constantine and Raven agree to combine their magic to give Trigon a
   physical body back so that he can continue fighting Darkseid. Cyborg
   then reveals his plan to teleport the Paradooms back to Apokolips while
   dragging the planet into a boom tube with no exit. Cyborg teleports the
   heroes back to Earth and commences his plan. Relishing the battle,
   Trigon prevents Darkseid's escape.

   Despite their victory, Batman reveals one-third of Earth's magma has
   been drained by the Reapers, and that people will continue to die by
   the millions before the League can potentially find a solution. As a
   result, Constantine convinces Flash to run back in time and reset the
   timeline again. Flash reluctantly does so and the heroes watch as the
   timeline resets.
