   Marjorie Morgenstern, born 1916, is a New York Jewish girl in the
   1930s. She is bright, beautiful, and popular, with many admirers. Her
   father is a prosperous businessman who has recently moved his family
   from a poorer, ethnically Jewish neighborhood in the Bronx to
   Manhattan's Upper West Side. Her mother hopes that the change of
   neighborhood will help Marjorie marry a man with a brighter future.

   Marjorie aspires to become an actress, using "Marjorie Morningstar" as
   a stage name. ("Morningstar" is the literal translation of
   "Morgenstern" from the original German.) She begins with her school's
   (Hunter College) production of The Mikado, and lands the title role. As
   a result, she meets Marsha Zelenko, who will become her best friend
   (for a while). Marsha encourages Marjorie in her quest, and helps her
   get a job as a drama counselor at the summer camp where Marsha teaches
   arts and crafts. That summer, Marsha persuades Marjorie to accompany
   her on an excursion to South Wind, an exclusive resort with a staff of
   professional entertainers. There Marjorie meets Noel Airman, an older
   man who has won some fame as a composer, as well as Wally Wronken, a
   younger man who hopes to become a playwright.

   Marjorie idolizes Noel, who can sing, dance, compose, and speak several
   languages. They begin a relationship that determines the next four
   years of her life. He tells her that he has no interest in marrying, or
   fitting in with the middle-class life that he tells her she will
   ultimately want. Having changed his birth name from Saul to Noel to
   escape his Jewish origins, he mocks her Jewish observances (such as her
   unwillingness to eat bacon), and taunts her for her 'Mosaic'
   unwillingness to engage in premarital sex. Noel tells Marjorie that she
   is a " Shirley": a typical, well-brought-up New York Jewish girl who
   will ultimately want a stable husband and family, while he is embarking
   on an artistic career.

   Over the course of the novel, neither Noel nor Marjorie finds
   professional success in the theater. Marjorie accepts that she will not
   succeed as a professional actress, and spends more of her time reading
   and working. Noel takes and quits stable writing and editing jobs,
   blaming Marjorie for motivating him to take jobs that do not suit him
   and for his unhappiness. He flees New York in a panic rather than marry
   Marjorie, saying that he will not succeed as a writer and will return
   to studying philosophy. Having entered a sexual relationship with him,
   Marjorie is convinced that her only hope is to marry Noel. She decides
   that the best way to persuade him to marry her is to wait a year and
   then pursue him to Paris.

   However, en route to France, Marjorie meets a mysterious man named Mike
   Eden aboard the Queen Mary. She enjoys his company, he treats her well
   and speaks respectfully of her religious traditions, and he helps her
   locate Noel. In Paris, Noel tells her how happy he is to see her, but
   does not notice when she is hungry or hurt. He tells her that in his
   year in Paris he has not actually enrolled in school to study
   philosophy, and that he will return to the U.S. to take another stable
   writing job. He offers to marry her, but Marjorie has realized that
   life with Noel will not make her happy, and that it would be possible
   for her to fall in love with someone else.

   She returns to New York free of her infatuation with Noel, and quickly
   marries, no longer caring whether Noel would describe her as a
   "Shirley". The novel concludes with an epilogue in the form of an entry
   in the diary of Wally Wronken, the only character who did manage to
   have a successful artistic career. Wally idolized Marjorie as a young
   man, and meets her again 15 years after she marries, when she has
   happily settled into a role as a religious suburban wife and mother.
   Wally recalls the bright-eyed girl he once knew, and marvels at how
   ordinary Marjorie seems at 39.

   The character name Airman is a translation to English of the Yiddish
   expression Luftmensch. The critic Dan Vogel writes that Wouk casts Noel
   as a "rasha" or bad or Satanic figure for leading Majorie in a descent
   from violating traditional Jewish laws of kashrut or kosher laws to
   violating traditional values of sexual morality.
