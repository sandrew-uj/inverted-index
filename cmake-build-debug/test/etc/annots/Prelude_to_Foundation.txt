   Prelude to Foundation is set in the year 12,020 G.E. (Galactic Era),
   during the rocky reign of the Emperor Cleon I. It starts with Seldon's
   presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how
   psychohistory might theoretically make it possible to predict the
   future. The Emperor of the Galactic Empire learns of this and wants to
   use Seldon for political gain. In a face-to-face interview, Seldon
   emphasizes that psychohistory is something that he has not even begun
   developing or even has a clear idea how to do so, but Cleon is not
   wholly convinced that Hari is of no use to the Empire.

   Seldon then meets reporter Chetter Hummin, who convinces him that
   Cleon's first minister, Eto Demerzel, is attempting to capture him, and
   that it is therefore imperative for Seldon to escape and try to make
   psychohistory practical. He is taken by Hummin to Streeling University,
   one of the top ranked of the Empire and introduced to Dors Venabili by
   Hummin. Seldon theorizes that the first development of psychohistory
   requires a smaller, yet still significant sample than the entire
   Empire, possibly just the original world where humans
   originated...which is now lost, along with much of the older historical
   records.

   Hari and Dors narrowly evade capture at Streeling University, and
   Hummin arranges for them to be sheltered in the reclusive Mycogen
   sector, which supposedly values its ancient history. Seldon and
   Venabili are welcomed by Sunmaster Fourteen, the leader of Mycogen.
   Seldon obtains the Mycogenians' treasured religious/historical book,
   but finds it disappointing except for the revelation of what the
   Mycogenians call their home planet, Aurora, and references to "robots"
   (which do not exist in the Empire). Seldon and Venabili face execution
   when Seldon insists on entering the Mycogenian "temple", the
   Sacratorium, in disguise in hopes of interviewing a robot supposedly
   housed there. They are easily detected, but Hummin arrives in the nick
   of time to save them.

   The action then shifts to the Dahl sector, where Seldon and Venabili
   rent rooms from a middle-class family. While in Dahl, they meet a
   guttersnipe named Raych, whom Seldon later adopts. Also in Dahl, they
   are told by an old wise woman that the Aurora of the Mycogenians is not
   the original world, but actually the "enemy" of the original human
   planet, called Earth. (This links with the Robot series.)

   Towards the end of the novel, Seldon, Venabili, and Raych are kidnapped
   and forcibly taken to see Rashelle, who is the Mayor of Wye, a powerful
   and vital sector situated at Trantor's south pole. Rashelle and her
   father have long been plotting to overthrow the Emperor and take his
   place. Seldon has the revelation that he could try to develop
   psychohistory using Trantor itself as a test case because of the great
   cultural diversity of its sectors. Rashelle launches her coup attempt,
   but it quickly collapses due to Demerzel's skillful subversion of Wye's
   forces. The finale reveals that "Hummin" is actually Eto Demerzel.
   Seldon then gets Demerzel to admit he is a robot; Demerzel is in fact
   R. Daneel Olivaw, who can influence humans mentally. He wants the
   development of psychohistory to help him better protect humanity, as
   per "The Zeroth Law Of Robotics". Seldon also suspects Venabili of
   being a robot, as well. This theme would subsequently be continued in
   Forward the Foundation.^[citation needed]
