   Hibbert, an imprisoned innocent, is caught up in the jailbreak of his
   cellmate Scarlatti, engineered with the assistance of another man,
   Burks. Forcing Hibbert to accompany them, Scarlatti and Burks make for
   the Florida Everglades, picking up Scarlatti's girlfriend Carlotta on
   the way.

   In the Everglades the four encounter a miraculous golden stairway
   extending into the sky. Ascending, they find a pool defended by a blue
   flamingo, which is killed by Burks. Another stairway leads them to the
   land of Khoire, a strange and mysterious paradise. There a man named
   Patur exposes the true nature of each by means of a crystal mask. He
   warns them that they will be transformed in accordance with those
   natures within a day, and must leave Khoire.

   Scarlatti and Carlotta's alteration is horrible, and they are consumed
   by a huge beast; Burks agrees to become a blue flamingo, taking the
   place of the guardian of the pool, in the hope of some day being
   readmitted to Khoire. Hibbert is little changed. Returning to the
   mundane world, he undertakes to find certain persons who can help him
   gain his own readmittance to Khoire, having fallen in love with one of
   its denizens, Mareth of the Watchers.
