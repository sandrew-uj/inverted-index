   The premise involves the married men of the fictional Fairfield County
   town of Stepford, Connecticut and their fawning, submissive, impossibly
   beautiful wives. The protagonist is Joanna Eberhart, a talented
   photographer newly arrived from New York City with her husband and
   children, eager to start a new life. As time goes on, she becomes
   increasingly disturbed by the submissive wives of Stepford who seem to
   lack free will, especially when she sees her once independent-minded
   friends, fellow new arrivals to Stepford, turn into mindless, docile
   housewives following a romantic weekend. Her husband, who seems to be
   spending more and more time at meetings of the local men's association,
   mocks her fears.

   As the story progresses, Joanna becomes convinced that the wives of
   Stepford are being poisoned or brainwashed into submission by the men's
   club. She visits the library and researches the pasts of Stepford's
   wives, discovering that some of the women were once feminist activists
   and very successful professionals and that the leader of the men's club
   is a former Disney engineer and others are artists and scientists,
   capable of creating lifelike robots. Her friend Bobbie helps her
   investigate, going so far as to write to the Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) to inquire about possible toxins in Stepford. However,
   eventually, Bobbie is also transformed into a docile housewife and has
   no interest in her previous activities.

   At the end of the novel, Joanna decides to flee Stepford, but when she
   gets home, she finds that her children have been taken. She asks her
   husband to let her leave but he takes her car keys. She manages to
   escape from the house on foot and several of the men's club members
   track her down. They corner her in the woods, and she accuses them of
   creating robots out of the town's women. The men deny the accusation
   and ask Joanna if she would believe them if she saw one of the other
   women bleed. Joanna agrees to this, and they take her to Bobbie's
   house. Bobbie's husband and son are upstairs, with loud rock music
   playing as if to cover screams. The scene ends as Bobbie brandishes a
   knife at her former friend.

   In the story's epilogue, Joanna has become another Stepford wife
   gliding through the local supermarket, having given up her career as a
   photographer, while Ruthanne (a new resident in Stepford) appears
   poised to become the town's next victim.
