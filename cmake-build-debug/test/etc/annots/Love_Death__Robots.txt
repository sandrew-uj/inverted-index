   The animated series consists of stand-alone episodes, all under 20
   minutes long, and produced by different casts and crews, though some
   episodes may share certain crew members. The series title refers to
   each episode's thematic connection to the three aforementioned
   subjects, though not every episode contains all three
   elements.
