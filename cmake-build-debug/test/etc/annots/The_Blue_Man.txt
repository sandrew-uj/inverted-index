   Steve Forrester is a teenager who goes to live for a summer with his
   aunt and uncle, who run a rural motel.

   On his first day running the desk by himself, a strange man checks in,
   dressed in a scarf, hat, trench coat and gloves, unusual attire for
   summer. The light on the desk starts to flicker as the man signs in
   with an illegible scrawl. Later, Steve brings a towel to the stranger's
   room and sees something that launches him on an unusual and singular
   adventure: the man's skin is bright blue and he seems to be draining
   energy from a nearby lamp.

   After his uncle is seemingly murdered by the fleeing Blue Man (who
   appears to possibly be of alien origin), Steve sets out on a
   cross-country search for justice and revenge.
