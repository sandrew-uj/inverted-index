   At the beginning of the first book, Katherine Talgarth ("Kate") and her
   beautiful younger sister Georgina have been taken by their Aunt
   Charlotte Rushton from Rushton (in Essex) to London to experience part
   of the Season. Kate's parents, George Talgarth and Celia Rushton, have
   both died at least five years before. Kate's favorite cousin, Cecelia
   Rushton ("Cecy"), has been left at home with her brother Oliver and
   their father, the antiquarian Arthur Rushton, at Rushton Manor. Oliver
   and Cecy's mother died when Cecy was quite young. Their father's other
   unmarried sister, Aunt Elizabeth Rushton, lives with them at Rushton
   Manor.
