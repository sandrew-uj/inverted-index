   As with the film and the live-action series, Return to the Planet of
   the Apes involved a handful of astronauts from Earth who were hurtled
   into the future and found themselves stuck in a world populated by
   advanced apes and primitive humans. Over the course of the thirteen
   episodes the astronauts attempted to keep one step ahead of the apes
   while at the same time trying to make some sense of what had happened.
   Additionally, they did their best to safeguard the human population
   from the apes.

   Each episode was self-contained to an extent. The story threads did
   weave in and out, with characters and plots from earlier episodes
   popping up in later ones. In order for the series to make any sense,
   the episodes need to be viewed in order.

   The animated series does chronologically fit with the rest of the Apes
   universe. It borrows characters and elements from the movies, the TV
   series and the original novel. General Urko is borrowed from the TV
   series. Along with Zaius, Zira and Cornelius, Brent (renamed here as
   Ron Brent) and Nova are from the movie series. Krador and the
   Underdwellers in the animated series are loosely based on the mutants
   in Beneath the Planet of the Apes.

   As with the live action television series, the animated series was
   concluded before the resolution of the storyline, and we do not learn
   if the astronauts are able to return to their own time period. But the
   animated series does otherwise offer a conclusion. Doctor Zaius, in
   recognising the threat of a military overthrow from General Urko,
   assures that he is relieved of command. Further, Cornelius and Zira, in
   recognising that simian society was established long after human
   society had deteriorated, believed that the time was right for humans
   to be offered equal rights to that of apes and intend to present their
   proposition to the Senate.

   Characters in the animated series frequently mention prominent apes
   noticeably named after human historical figures by appropriately
   inserting the word "ape" into their name. A notable example is "William
   Apespeare", an ape analog of William Shakespeare. Another scene shows a
   couple of ape soldiers chatting about a new movie called The Apefather,
   an apparent analog of The Godfather (unlike the live-action series and
   movies, the ape society is presented as being technologically advanced
   - as in the novel - rather than agrarian).
