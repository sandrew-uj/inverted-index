   Blackout is set several decades after the zombie apocalypse, the
   Rising. Kellis-Amberlee is a normally beneficial virus that, on the
   death of any host mammal over 40 pounds (18 kg), "goes live" or
   "amplifies", and turns them into a zombie. Most humans reside in
   controlled zones, and blogs are now the primary source of news and
   entertainment. The novel is written from the perspectives of Georgia
   and Shaun Mason, siblings and blogger-reporters. Over the preceding
   books, they, along with their colleagues at the After The End Times
   website, have uncovered a widespread conspiracy. The Centers for
   Disease Control (CDC), the agency responding to the zombie virus and
   responsible for public health and safety, is actually creating new
   substrains (culminating in a mosquito-transmitted variant released at
   the end of Deadline), killing off those developing immune responses
   (including Georgia, who was assassinated during the events of Feed),
   and frustrating research into a cure.

   Shaun Mason, having discovered his immunity to the virus, is helping
   with Dr. Abbey's zombie research while hiding out from the CDC with the
   rest of the After the End Times team: Rebecca Atherton, Mahir Gowda,
   Maggie Garcia, and Alaric Kwong. Dr. Abbey tasks Shaun and Rebecca with
   travelling to zombie-infested Florida and recovering live mosquitoes
   for study, but when they head back to Berkeley, California to meet with
   Shaun's adoptive parents, they are lured into a trap and barely escape
   the CDC. Disheartened, Shaun and Rebecca head north to Seattle, where
   Maggie and Mahir have contacted the identity forger, the Monkey. He
   agrees to help them disappear with new identities if they help steal
   information from the Seattle CDC facility. The team, minus Maggie,
   breaks in and set up a remote-access Wi-Fi hotspot, but their escape is
   hampered by a security alert.

   After dying, Georgia awakens as a prisoner in a CDC facility and
   quickly concludes that she is a clone. With the help of Epidemic
   Intelligence Service (EIS) undercover agents, Georgia learns she is a
   97 percent match to the mind of the original Georgia and is intended as
   a "showroom model" for resurrection through cloning. She also discovers
   she is in Seattle, and other Georgia clones have been created,
   including a less mentally accurate but more compliant version for use
   against Shaun. The agents use a week-long sleep study as a cover to
   remove trackers and self-destruct devices implanted in Georgia's body,
   but a mole exposes the EIS team. Georgia escapes and takes the security
   alert as an opportunity to destroy the other clones.

   Shaun, seeking an exit, runs into Georgia, fleeing her improvised
   explosives. They link up with Rebecca and Mahir, and escape to meet
   Maggie at the Agora luxury hotel. Although initially reluctant to
   accept Georgia's existence, her knowledge and mannerisms gradually
   convince the group that she is a real, accurate clone. They go to see
   the Monkey but are betrayed by one of his subordinates. A CDC squad
   attacks the location: the Monkey and his people are killed, and Maggie
   is wounded. She is left at the Agora for treatment, and the team heads
   back to Dr. Abbey's lab, where an EIS agent is waiting to transport
   them to Washington, D.C.. They are taken to the White House by Rick
   Cousins (former After the End Times journalist, now Vice President of
   the United States) to meet President Peter Ryman, who is being coerced
   to continue the conspiracy.

   The CDC has found a cure for Kellis-Amberlee, but the cure destroys the
   immune system so instead, they have focused on engineering the virus to
   prevent natural immunities from developing, while taking measures to
   ensure they remain in power. While Shaun, Becks, and Alaric are briefed
   on (and secretly recording) the party line by a CDC scientist, Rick
   takes Georgia aside to explain the situation before they, with help
   from the EIS and the Secret Service, "kidnap" Ryman. The CDC initiates
   an outbreak inside the White House, during which Rebecca sacrifices
   herself to hold back the horde while the others escape. The survivors
   head to an EIS facility, where Shaun and Georgia help Ryman address the
   world, while Mahir orchestrates junior members of After the End Times
   to upload supporting evidence and blow the conspiracy wide open. As the
   world comes to terms with the revelations, the EIS takes over the CDC,
   while Georgia and Shaun head to the wilds of Canada to escape the
   limelight.
