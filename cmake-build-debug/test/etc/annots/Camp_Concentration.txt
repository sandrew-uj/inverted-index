   Poet, lapsed Catholic and conscientious objector Louis Sacchetti is
   sent to a secret military installation called Camp Archimedes, where
   military prisoners are injected with a form of syphilis intended to
   make them geniuses (hence the punning reference to "concentration" in
   the novel's title). By breaking down rigid categories in the mind
   (according to a definition of genius put forward by Arthur Koestler),
   the disease makes the thought process both faster and more flexible; it
   also causes physical breakdown and, within nine months, death.

   The book is told in the form of Sacchetti's diary, and includes
   literary references to the story of Faust (at one point the prisoners
   stage Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus and Sacchetti's friendship
   with ringleader Mordecai Washington parallels Faust's with
   Mephistopheles). It only becomes clear that Sacchetti himself has
   syphilis as his diary entries refer to his increasingly poor health,
   and become progressively more florid, until almost descending into
   insanity.

   After a test run on the prisoners, a megalomaniac nuclear physicist has
   himself injected with the disease, joins Camp Archimedes with his team
   of student helpers, and sets about trying to end the human race.

   The prisoners in the book appear to be fascinated by alchemy, which
   they used as an elaborate cover for their escape plans. Sacchetti, who
   is obese, has a number of ironic visions involving other obese
   historical and intellectual figures, such as Thomas Aquinas.
