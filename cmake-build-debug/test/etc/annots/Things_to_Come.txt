   In the city of Everytown in southern England, businessman John Cabal
   (Raymond Massey) cannot enjoy Christmas Day, 1940, with the news
   everywhere of possible war. His guest, Harding (Maurice Braddell),
   shares his worries, while another friend, the over-optimistic Pippa
   Passworthy (Edward Chapman), believes it will not come to pass, and if
   it does, it will accelerate technological progress. An aerial bombing
   raid on the city that night results in general mobilisation and then
   global war.

   Months later, Cabal, now a Royal Air Force airman piloting a Hawker
   Fury, shoots down an enemy aircraft dropping gas on the British
   countryside. He lands and pulls the badly injured enemy pilot (John
   Clements) from the wreckage. As they dwell on the madness of war, they
   put on their gas masks, as poison gas drifts in their direction. When a
   young girl runs towards them the wounded pilot insists she take his
   mask, choosing to accept death to save her life. Cabal takes the girl
   to his aeroplane, pausing to leave the doomed man a revolver. The pilot
   dwells on the irony that he may have gassed the child's family and yet
   he has sacrificed his own life in order to save her. A gun shot is
   heard.

   The war continues into the 1960s, long enough for the people of the
   world to have forgotten why they are fighting. Humanity enters a new
   dark age. Every city in the world is in ruins, the economy has been
   devastated by hyperinflation, and there is little technology left apart
   from weapons of war. By 1966 the enemy's armies and navies have been
   defeated, but their greatly depleted air force is deploying a
   biological weapon called the "wandering sickness" in a final desperate
   bid for victory. Dr. Harding and his daughter struggle to find a cure,
   but with little equipment it is hopeless. The plague kills half of
   humanity and extinguishes the last vestiges of government.

   By 1970, the warlord Rudolf (Ralph Richardson), known as the "Boss",
   has become the chieftain of Everytown and eradicated the pestilence by
   shooting the infected. He has started yet another war, this time
   against the "hill people" of the Floss Valley to obtain coal and shale
   to render into oil so his ragtag collection of prewar planes can fly
   again.

   On May Day 1970, a sleek new aeroplane lands in Everytown, startling
   the inhabitants who have not seen a new machine in many years. The
   pilot, John Cabal, emerges and proclaims that the last surviving band
   of engineers and mechanics known as "World Communications" have formed
   a civilisation of airmen called "Wings Over the World", based in Basra,
   Iraq. They have outlawed war and are rebuilding civilisation throughout
   the Near East and the Mediterranean. Cabal considers the Boss and his
   band of warlords to be brigands, but offers them the opportunity to
   join them in rebuilding the world. The Boss immediately rejects the
   offer and takes Cabal prisoner, forcing him to work for his mechanic
   Gordon, who struggles to keep the Boss's biplanes airworthy. Gordon
   takes an Avro 504K up for a test flight and heads for Iraq to alert
   World Communications.

   Gigantic flying wing aircraft arrive over Everytown and saturate its
   population with sleeping gas globes. The Boss orders his air force to
   attack, but the obsolete fighters inflict little damage. The people
   awaken shortly thereafter to find themselves under the control of Wings
   Over the World and the Boss dead from a fatal allergic reaction to the
   sleeping gas. Cabal observes, "Dead, and his old world dead with him
   ... and with a new world beginning ... And now for the rule of the
   Airmen and a new life for mankind".

   A montage follows, showing decades of technological progress, beginning
   with Cabal explaining plans for global consolidation by Wings Over the
   World. By 2036, mankind lives in modern underground cities, including
   the new Everytown. Civilisation is at last devoted to peace and
   scientific progress.

   All is not well, however. The sculptor Theotocopulos (Cedric Hardwicke)
   incites the populace to demand a "rest" from all the rush of progress,
   symbolised by the coming first manned flight around the Moon. The
   modern-day Luddites are opposed by Oswald Cabal, the head of the
   governing council and grandson of John Cabal. Oswald Cabal's daughter
   Catherine (Pearl Argyle) and Maurice Passworthy (Kenneth Villiers)
   insist on manning the capsule. When a mob later forms and rushes to
   destroy the space gun, used to propel the projectile toward the Moon,
   Cabal launches it ahead of schedule.

   Later, after the projectile is just a tiny light in the immense night
   sky, Oswald Cabal delivers a stirring philosophical monologue about
   what is to come for mankind to his troubled and questioning friend,
   Raymond Passworthy (Chapman), the father of Maurice. He speaks
   passionately for progress and humanity's unending quest for knowledge
   and advancement as it journeys out into immensity of space to conquer
   the stars and beyond. He concludes with the rhetorical questions, "All
   the universe or nothing? Which shall it be, Passworthy? Which shall it
   be? ..."
