   The series depicts a future in which Earth is dominated by a race of
   self-aware machines that was spawned from the creation of artificial
   intelligence early in the 21st century. At one point conflict arose
   between mankind and machines, and the machines rebelled against their
   creators. Mankind attempted to block out the machines' source of solar
   power by covering the sky in thick, stormy clouds. A massive war
   emerged between the two adversaries which ended with the machines
   victorious, capturing mankind. Having lost their definite source of
   energy, the machines devised a way to extract the human body's
   bioelectric and thermal energies by enclosing people in pods, while
   their minds are controlled by cybernetic implants connecting them to a
   simulated reality called the Matrix.

   The virtual reality world simulated by the Matrix resembles human
   civilization around the turn of the 21st century (this time period was
   chosen because it is supposedly the pinnacle of human civilization).
   The environment inside the Matrix is practically indistinguishable from
   reality (although scenes set within the Matrix are presented on-screen
   with a green tint to the footage, and a general bias towards the color
   green), and the vast majority of humans connected to it are unaware of
   its true nature. Most of the central characters in the series are able
   to gain superhuman abilities within the Matrix by taking advantage of
   their understanding of its true nature to manipulate its virtual
   physical laws. The films take place both inside the Matrix and outside
   of it, in the real world; the parts that take place in the Matrix are
   set in a vast Western megacity.

   The virtual world is first introduced in The Matrix. The short comic
   "Bits and Pieces of Information" and the Animatrix short film The
   Second Renaissance show how the initial conflict between mankind and
   machines came about, and how and why the Matrix was first developed.
   Its history and purpose are further explained in The Matrix Reloaded.
   In The Matrix Revolutions a new status quo is established in the
   Matrix's place in mankind and machines' conflict. This was further
   explored in The Matrix Online, a now defunct MMORPG.
