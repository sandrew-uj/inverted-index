   Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 science
   fiction novel by German author Alfred Doeblin. Stylistically and
   structurally experimental, the novel follows the development of human
   society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts
   between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating
   in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to
   melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has
   the reputation of being a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not
   received nearly as much attention as Doeblin's following novel, Berlin
   Alexanderplatz (1929).
