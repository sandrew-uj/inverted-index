   Marian MacAlpin works in a market research firm, writing survey
   questions and sampling products. She shares the top-floor apartment of
   a house in Toronto (never named in the novel) with her roommate Ainsley
   and dates a dependable and boring boyfriend, Peter. Marian also keeps
   in touch with Clara, a friend from college, who is now a constantly
   pregnant housewife.

   Ainsley announces she wants to have a baby - and intends to do it
   without getting married. When Marian is horrified, Ainsley replies,
   "The thing that ruins families these days is the husbands." Looking for
   a man who will have no interest in fatherhood, she sets her sights on
   Marian's "womanizer" friend Len, who is infamous for his relationships
   with young, naive girls.

   At work, Marian is assigned the task of gathering responses for a
   survey about a new brand of beer. While walking from house to house
   asking people their opinions, she meets Duncan, a graduate student in
   English who intrigues her with his atypical and eccentric answers.

   Marian later has a dinner date with Peter and Len, during which Ainsley
   shows up dressed as a virginal schoolgirl - the first stage of her plan
   to trick Len into impregnating her. Marian finds herself disassociating
   from her body as Peter recounts a gory rabbit hunt to Len:

     "After a while I noticed that a large drop of something wet had
     materialized on the table. I poked it with my finger and smudged it
     around a little before I realized with horror that it was a
     tear."

   Marian runs from the restaurant and is chased down by Peter in his car.
   Unaware of Ainsley's plan to get pregnant by Len, Peter chides,
   "Ainsley behaved herself properly, why couldn't you?"

   At the end of the night, Peter proposes to her. When asked to choose a
   date for the wedding, Marian slips into unexpected passivity:

     "'I'd rather have you decide that. I'd rather leave the big
     decisions up to you.' I was astonished at myself. I'd never said
     anything remotely like that to him before. The funny thing was that
     I really meant it."

   Marian and Duncan have a surprise meeting in a laundromat, engage in
   awkward conversation, and kiss. Shortly afterwards, Marian's problems
   with food begin when she finds herself empathizing with a steak that
   Peter is eating, imagining it "knocked on the head as it stood in a
   queue like someone waiting for a streetcar." After this, she is unable
   to eat meat - anything with "bone or tendon or fiber".

   Ainsley's plot to seduce Len succeeds. When Len later learns that
   Ainsley is pregnant, he talks to Marian, who confesses that pregnancy
   was Ainsley's plan all along. Len reveals his childhood fear of eggs,
   and from that point Marian can no longer face her soft-boiled egg in
   the morning. Soon thereafter, she is unable to eat vegetables or cake.

   Peter decides to throw a party, to which Marian invites "the office
   virgins" from her work, Duncan, and Duncan's roommates. Peter suggests
   that Marian buy herself a new dress for his party - something less
   "mousy" than her normal wardrobe. Marian submits to his wishes and buys
   a daring red dress. Before the party, Ainsley does Marian's makeup,
   including false eyelashes and a big lipsticked smile. When Duncan
   arrives, he says, "You didn't tell me it was a masquerade. Who the hell
   are you supposed to be?" He leaves and Marian follows. They end up
   going to a sleazy hotel, where they have unsatisfying sex. The next
   morning, they go out to breakfast and Marian finds that she cannot eat
   anything.

   After Duncan leaves, Marian realizes that Peter is metaphorically
   devouring her. To test him, she bakes a pink cake in the shape of a
   woman and dares him to eat it. "This is what you really want", she
   says, offering the cake woman as a substitute to him feeding upon her.
   Peter leaves disturbed. Once Peter leaves, Marian feels hungry and
   realizes it's just a cake so she starts eating it.

   Marian returns to her first person narrative in the closing pages of
   the book. Duncan shows up at her apartment; Marian offers him the
   remains of the cake, which he polishes off. "'Thank you,' he said,
   licking his lips. 'It was delicious.'"
