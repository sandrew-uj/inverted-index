   The series is set in a fictional world in which many near-omnipotent
   "divinities" once ruled over a large continent, imposing their whims on
   its peoples but also protecting them and allowing them to conquer and
   enslave the island nation of Saypur. But after the Saypuri found a way
   to overthrow and kill the divinities, almost all of their miracles
   ceased to work and the continent was plunged into plague and chaos.

   At the outset of the first novel, City of Stairs, the Saypuri republic,
   emerging as an industrial and military power from the ruins of the
   divine empire, is militarily occupying the continent. The young Saypuri
   spy Shara Komayd and her brawny henchman Sigrud arrive in the
   continental capital of Bulikov and are faced with a plot to overthrow
   Saypuri authority and restore a divine regime.

   In the second novel, City of Blades, set five years later, the
   war-weary Saypuri general Turyin Mulaghesh is pressured by her
   government to investigate the Continental city of Voortyashthan, where
   an insurgency against the Saypuri occupation is brewing amidst
   controversial efforts to reconstruct the Continent's economy. The third
   novel, City of Miracles, follows the actions of Sigrud following the
   events of City of Blades.
