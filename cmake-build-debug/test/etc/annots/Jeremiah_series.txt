   The year is 2021, 15 years after a plague has killed nearly everyone
   over the age of thirteen (both the event and the virus itself are
   referred to as "The Big Death" and "The Big D"). Two young men,
   Jeremiah and Kurdy, meet up and join forces with those inside "Thunder
   Mountain" and help rebuild civilization. Jeremiah is searching for the
   "Valhalla Sector" where his father may still be alive.

   The eponymous Jeremiah is a semi-loner who has spent the last 15 years
   travelling back and forth across the United States, seeking out a
   living and looking for a place called "Valhalla Sector" (the remains of
   Raven Rock), which his father--a viral researcher--had mentioned to
   Jeremiah as a possible refuge shortly before disappearing into the
   chaos of "the Big Death." A stop in the Colorado trading town of
   Clarefield results in Jeremiah teaming up with another lone traveller
   named Kurdy, before being imprisoned by the town's warlord in a cell
   with a man named Simon, who wants to recruit Jeremiah for a vague and
   mysterious organization. With Kurdy's help, Jeremiah and Simon escape,
   but Simon is fatally wounded in the process.

   Following the instructions given to them by the dying Simon, Jeremiah
   and Kurdy take Simon's truck back to "Thunder Mountain," the remains of
   the NORAD complex, where they discover a well-organized and -equipped
   group operating out of the base, led by the former child prodigy Markus
   Alexander. Markus chooses to employ Jeremiah and Kurdy as a recon team
   to replace the now dead Simon and his partner, sending the two men back
   outside to gather information in preparation for the time when the
   mountain will need to start rebuilding the world.

   Over the course of the first season, the group increasingly encounters
   threats originating from Valhalla Sector, which they discover to be a
   sealed and heavily armed bunker complex in West Virginia, used to house
   the remains of the US government and military leadership during the Big
   Death. The survivors there plan to rebuild the world in an
   authoritarian mold, combining their military power with attempts to
   control the "Big Death" virus itself in order to wipe out resistance by
   slaughtering non-compliant populations. The second half of Season 1
   primarily deals with the efforts of Jeremiah and Thunder Mountain to
   stop Valhalla Sector.

   After the final defeat of Valhalla Sector in the opening episodes of
   Season 2, a new threat emerges in the form of a crusading army from the
   East, led by a mysterious prophetic figure known as Daniel. Season 2
   deals with the impending conflict between the unifying survivor
   communities under Thunder Mountain, and the advancing Army of Daniel.

   Although a third season was considered, series creator J. Michael
   Straczynski made it clear that if the show ran a further season he
   would have nothing to do with it. The show concluded with the end of
   the second season resolving most plot threads.
