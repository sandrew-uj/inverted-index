   The United States is devastated by a mysterious phenomenon that
   reanimates recently-dead human beings as flesh-eating zombies. Three
   weeks into the crisis, it has been reported that millions of people
   have died and reanimated; despite the government's best efforts, social
   order is collapsing. Rural communities and the National Guard have been
   effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, but urban
   centers are helplessly overrun.

   At WGON TV, a television studio in Philadelphia, traffic reporter
   Stephen Andrews and his pregnant girlfriend, producer Fran Parker, are
   planning to steal the station's helicopter to escape the city. Across
   town, police SWAT officer Roger DeMarco and his team raid a low-income
   housing project, where the mostly black and Latino tenants are defying
   the martial law of delivering their dead to the National Guard. The
   raid quickly descends into chaos when armed residents engage in a
   shootout with the officers. Roger attempts to restrain Wooley, a brutal
   and racist trooper, after he maniacally kills several unarmed
   civilians; Wooley is shot dead by an officer from another unit, Peter
   Washington. As the SWAT team dispatch the reanimated dead that have
   injured or killed several tenants, Roger forms an alliance with Peter,
   suggesting that they desert and join up with Stephen, who is his
   friend. They are informed by an elderly priest about a group of zombies
   in the basement, which they assist in the grim job of eliminating.

   Later that night, Roger and Peter rendezvous with Fran and Stephen at a
   police dock and then leave Philadelphia in the helicopter. Following
   some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a
   shopping mall, which they make their sanctuary. They devise an
   operation to block the mall entrances with trucks to keep the undead
   from penetrating. Peter and Stephen also cover the access to the
   stairwell. During the operation, Roger survives a particularly
   dangerous encounter, and becomes reckless as a result. He is soon
   bitten by the zombies.

   After clearing the mall's interior of zombies, the four enjoy a
   hedonistic lifestyle with all the goods available to them, furnishing
   their makeshift apartment with the mall's many commodities. Roger
   eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies; he is shot by Peter upon
   reanimating. Sometime later, all emergency broadcast transmissions
   cease, suggesting that the government has collapsed and a large portion
   of the population has become zombies. Fran, now showing her pregnancy,
   presses to leave the mall. Supplies are loaded into the helicopter, and
   Stephen gives her flying lessons.

   Having seen the helicopter, a nomadic biker gang arrive to conquer the
   mall, destroying the barriers and allowing hundreds of zombies back
   inside. The looting bikers enrage Stephen, and he triggers a gun battle
   with them. Stephen is shot before being bitten by the undead. As some
   of the bikers are eaten by zombies, the rest retreat with their stolen
   goods. Stephen, now reanimated, acts on a remnant of his memories and
   tears down the wall covering the stairwell and leads the undead to Fran
   and Peter. Peter kills Stephen while Francine escapes to the roof.
   Peter locks himself in a room and contemplates suicide, but when the
   zombies burst in, he has a change of heart and fights his way up to the
   roof, where he joins Francine. The two then fly away in the helicopter
   to an uncertain future, leaving the now-abandoned mall to be overrun by
   the zombie horde.
