   The Purple Cloud was reprinted in the June 1949 issue of Famous
   Fantastic Mysteries

   The story, a recording of a medium's meditation over the future writing
   of the text, details the narrator, Adam Jeffson, on an expedition to
   the North Pole during the 20th century on board the Boreal. Jeffson's
   fiancee, the Countess Clodagh, poisons her own cousin to secure a place
   on the ship for Jeffson, because the expedition was known to be one of
   the best ever planned. A millionaire, who died some years previously,
   had provided in his will for the payment of millions of dollars to the
   first person to reach the Pole.

   Before Jeffson leaves, he hears a priest speaking against polar
   research, calling the failure of all previous expeditions the will of
   God, and prophesying a terrible fate for those who attempt to go
   against God's will. Jeffson remembers meeting with a man who claimed
   that the universe is a place of strife between vague "powers", "The
   White" and "The Black", which vie for dominance.

   Throughout the polar journey, Jeffson discovers that his course has
   been guided by these mysterious forces. He finds a huge lake of
   spinning water, with a rocky island inlaid with inscriptions. Upon
   seeing this, Jeffson faints. When he returns to his camp he feels
   nauseated after having smelled a peculiar peach-like odour. He also
   notices a moving purple cloud, spreading in the heavens. During the
   journey, he discovers dead animals, all without injury, and he learns
   of the death of his crew.

   The ship being fairly easy to operate, he sets out by himself.
   First, he travels towards northern islands, but upon seeing the death
   of all various races from around the Earth there (the result of an
   exodus, escaping the death-bringing cloud), and meeting ships crowded
   with corpses, he comes instead to the dead continent, walking through
   London, searching for news of the cloud. He looks for any survivors,
   but finds all barricades broken through by mad crowds. Later, he goes
   to the house of Arthur Machen (a close friend of Shiel's), whom he
   finds dead, having been writing a poem until the very end. There, he
   finds the notebook into which he writes his whole narrative.

   The later parts of the book describe Jeffson's descent into mad
   pompousness: adopting Turkish attire, he declares himself monarch and
   burns down cities (including Paris, Bordeaux, London, and San
   Francisco) for pleasure. He then commits his life to one task, the
   construction of a huge and colossal golden palace on the isle of
   Imbros, which he means to dedicate as an altar to God and a palace to
   himself. He spends seventeen years on the palace, several times
   abandoning the work, until its completion, when he recognises the
   vanity of it.

   While travelling through Constantinople, which he also burns down, he
   meets a twenty-year-old naked woman who is without the slightest
   knowledge of anything in the world. She continues to follow him, no
   matter how he mistreats her. Gradually, he accepts her, but forces her
   to wear a veil over her mouth. Her speed at learning astonishes him, so
   he teaches her to speak, read, cook, fish, and dress. The girl (who is
   unable to pronounce "r", instead saying "l") reveals that she had lived
   her whole life in a cellar below the royal palace of Turkey, and that
   she knew nothing of the world until she was freed when Jeffson burned
   down Constantinople. She becomes absorbed in the Bible and declares the
   humans who sought for riches as "spoiled".

   Jeffson struggles mightily against his growing affection towards the
   girl, wishing to end the human race. At the end, when he leaves to go
   to England, she telephones him about the re-appearance of the Purple
   Cloud over France. He rushes to her, embracing her as his wife and now
   hoping to find a way to escape the cloud. She tells him to trust that
   God will not allow her to die. He concludes his writing by saying that
   he has accepted his role and that after three weeks have passed no
   purple cloud has appeared, and he looks forward to the two of them
   becoming the progenitors of future humanity.
