   Sixteen-year-old Sybel lives alone on a mountain, with only the
   mythical creatures that her deceased father Ogam summoned for company.
   Sybel cares for the creatures and shares a type of telepathy with them.
   However, in the dead of night, a man named Coren of Sirle gives her a
   baby to care for. Coren believes the baby is none other than the child
   of Rianna, the now deceased queen of Eld, and her dead lover, Norrel,
   although it is later revealed that he is the son of Rianna and Drede,
   king of Eldwold. Sybel accepts the baby, Tamlorn, on Coren's conditions
   that she love it, and cares for Tamlorn with the help of the witch
   Maelga who lives near the mountain.

   Twelve years later, Coren comes back for Tamlorn. Sybel refuses to
   return him, believing that Coren and his brothers would use Tamlorn in
   their plot against Drede, the king of Eld. She later reluctantly gives
   Tamlorn to Drede along with the mythical falcon Ter, to watch over
   Tamlorn. As a result Sybel falls into a depression and resumes her
   quest to summon the Liralen, a legendary white bird. Instead, she not
   only finds the Blammor, a creature of shadow that induces fear, but the
   wizard Mithran who has been paid by Drede to destroy Sybel's will and
   hand her over to him. However, Mithran desires Sybel and Sybel manages
   to escape by summoning the Blammor who crushes every bone in Mithran's
   body to splinters.

   Upon returning to her home, where Coren is recovering from his injuries
   caused by one of the creatures in Sybel's care, Sybel induces Coren to
   marry her, knowing he loves her and she can use him and his love as a
   tool for revenge against Drede. They journey to Coren's home and get
   married. Later in the book, Sybel and Coren transport the mythical
   beasts and Sybel's books to Coren's home.

   Sybel plans to start a war between Coren's people in Sirle, who oppose
   Drede, and Drede. Coren discovers this and is upset with Sybel. The
   Blammor, whom Sybel held on condition of her fearlessness, comes to
   Sybel in the night, and she sees in her mind, the Liralen with its neck
   broken. Sybel flees to the now deserted Eld Mountain and sets all the
   creatures free. They choose to lure Drede and his army, and the Sirle
   lords and their army, away from each other, thus defusing the war
   (although it is unknown at the end of the book whether the lords and
   armies will return, other than Coren). Tamlorn wakes Sybel up and tells
   her that Drede had died, that he thinks that whatever killed the wizard
   Mithran also killed Drede, and he is now king of Eldwold. They go to
   Maelga's house where Sybel meets Coren, who asks her why he should
   return to her. She tells him he is the only person who can bring her
   joy, and they reunite. On a hunch, Sybel summons the Blammor which
   reveals itself to be the Liralen. Sybel asks the Liralen to take her
   and Coren home.
