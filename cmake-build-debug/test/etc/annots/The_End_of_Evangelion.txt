   Teenager Shinji Ikari is the pilot of Evangelion Unit 01, one of
   several giant cyborgs designed to fight hostile supernatural entities
   called Angels. Distraught over the death of Kaworu Nagisa, Shinji
   visits fellow pilot Asuka Langley Soryu in a hospital and masturbates
   to her comatose body.

   The shadowy committee Seele discovers that Gendo Ikari intends to use
   Nerv, the paramilitary organization that deploys the Evangelion units,
   for his own plans. Seele dispatches the Japanese Strategic Self-Defense
   Force (JSSDF) to seize control of Nerv, killing most of the staff. Nerv
   major Misato Katsuragi orders Asuka moved to the cockpit of Evangelion
   Unit 02 and placed at the bottom of a lake, then rescues Shinji from
   JSSDF troops. Determined to have Shinji defend Nerv, Misato brings him
   to Unit 01's bay doors but is shot by soldiers. Before her death,
   Misato implores Shinji to pilot Unit 01, kisses him and forces him into
   the elevator before dying. Shinji discovers Unit 01 immobilized in
   bakelite.

   Concluding that Nerv's defeat is inevitable, Gendo retrieves Evangelion
   pilot Rei Ayanami. He plans to use her to initiate the Third Impact, a
   cataclysm that will kill everyone on Earth and reunite him with his
   deceased wife, Yui. Attempting to stop him, Nerv scientist Ritsuko
   Akagi sends a computer command to destroy Nerv. Casper, a computer core
   modeled on Ritsuko's mother's aspect as a woman, overrides her command,
   and Gendo shoots and kills her.

   Inside Unit 02, Asuka overcomes her trauma and re-activates the unit.
   She destroys the JSSDF forces, but Seele unleashes a fleet of new
   mass-produced pilotless Evangelion units, which she defeats before Unit
   02 runs out of power. However, the Eva units reanimate and disembowel
   Unit 02, killing Asuka in the process. Unit 01 breaks free of the
   bakelite and ascends above Nerv headquarters. From the cockpit, Shinji
   sees the mass-produced units carrying the mutilated remains of Unit 02
   and screams in horror.

   Gendo attempts to merge with Rei, who carries the soul of Lilith, an
   angel hidden beneath Nerv headquarters, to begin the Third Impact.
   Having merged with another angel, Adam, he will become a god if he
   merges with Lilith; however, Rei rejects Gendo, absorbs Adam, and
   reunites with Lilith, growing to a gargantuan size. The mass-produced
   Evangelion units pull Unit 01 into the sky and crucify it with the
   Lance of Longinus, which transforms into the "Tree of Life", beginning
   a cataclysm called the Third Impact.

   The remaining Nerv staff are visited by Rei, before dissolving into an
   orange liquid called LCL. Gendo sees Yui and states he avoided Shinji
   because he would only bring his son pain, and has his head bitten off
   by Unit 01. After several dreamlike contemplations, including a fight
   with Asuka begging for her affection, Shinji decides that he is alone
   and everyone else should die. In response, Rei, as Lilith, begins the
   process of Human Instrumentality and dissolves humanity back into a sea
   of LCL forming a conscious primordial soup, reforming the souls of
   humanity into a single consciousness. Once he realizes that his wish
   for this limitless existence where all are one comes at the cost of
   losing individuality and his friends, Shinji rejects Instrumentality,
   acknowledging that life is about experiencing pain as well as joy. Unit
   01, seemingly moving on its own, breaks free of the Tree of Life,
   wielding the re-materialized Lance of Longinus to end Third Impact.
   Lilith's body begins dissolving, crashing to the surface of the Earth.
   Yui tells Shinji anyone can return if they have the will to, and he
   bids her farewell.

   Sometime later, on a shoreline littered with the wreckage of Mass
   Production Units and the body of Lilith, Shinji is startled by the
   second human to return, Asuka. Shinji begins to strangle Asuka, but
   when she caresses his face, he stops and breaks down in tears.
