   On July 2, 1996, an enormous alien mothership arrives in the orbit of
   the Earth and deploys multiple saucers, each fifteen miles wide that
   take positions over Earth's major cities.

   David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal
   embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the
   aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his
   ex-wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David and
   his father Julius gain access to the Oval Office and alert President
   Thomas Whitmore to the threat.

   Whitmore orders evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and
   Washington, D.C., but it is too late. Each of the saucers fires a
   single destructive beam, causing a gargantuan explosion that
   incinerates each saucer's targeted city, killing millions. Whitmore,
   the Levinsons, and a few others escape aboard Air Force One as the
   capital is destroyed along with New York, Los Angeles, and other major
   cities around the world.

   On July 3, counterattacks against the alien invaders begin, but their
   ships are shielded by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of
   fighter vessels with their own shields, which decimate the human
   fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, one of the
   mission's squadron leaders, survives by luring his attacker to the
   enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon before ejecting from his plane,
   causing the enemy fighter to crash-land. He subdues the downed alien
   and flags down a convoy of refugees, transporting the unconscious alien
   to Area 51, where Whitmore's group has landed. Secretary of Defense
   Albert Nimzicki has revealed that a faction of the government has been
   involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders'
   attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished
   ship, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As scientist
   Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains
   consciousness and attacks, telepathically invading Okun's mind and
   killing other personnel. It uses Okun's vocal cords to reject
   Whitmore's offer of peace before launching a psychic attack against
   him. After Secret Service agents and military personnel kill the alien,
   Whitmore reveals what he learned when they were linked: the invaders
   plan to strip Earth of natural resources. He reluctantly authorizes a
   nuclear attack against one warship situated above Houston as a trial,
   but it remains intact. Steven's girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow and her son,
   having survived the destruction of Los Angeles, rescue a truckload of
   other survivors, including the critically injured First Lady Marilyn.
   Though they are later found by Steven and taken to Area 51, Marilyn
   dies shortly after being reunited with her family.

   On July 4, taking inspiration from his father, David writes a computer
   virus that will disrupt the aliens' shields' operating system, and
   devises a plan to upload it into the mothership from the refurbished
   alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military
   contacts different nations' surviving airborne squadrons around the
   world through Morse code to organize a united counter-offensive against
   the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore and General
   William Grey enlist the help of volunteers with flight experience,
   including retired soldier Russell Casse, to fly the remaining jets at
   Area 51; and the former leads an attack on a warship bearing down on
   the base while the latter oversees it. Entering the mothership, Steven
   and David upload the virus and deploy a nuclear missile on board;
   nullifying the aliens' communications system and reinforcements after
   the ship is destroyed. With the aliens' shields deactivated, Whitmore's
   squadron can combat the enemy fighters, but their ammunition is
   exhausted before they can destroy the saucer. As it prepares to fire on
   the base, Russell has one last missile, but is unable to fire due to a
   launcher malfunction; he sacrifices himself by crashing his jet with
   the missile into the saucer's weapon as it is charging to fire, which
   destroys the warship. Human military forces worldwide are notified of
   the alien ships' critical weakness and destroy the others.

   As humanity rejoices in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 and
   reunite with their families.
