   The book takes place on a fictional planet resembling late-Middle Ages
   Europe. A large empire broke up in the decade or so preceding the
   action, apparently from meteor or asteroid strikes that severely
   affected farming across much of the globe. The remnants of the empire
   still war with one another.

   The narrative alternates chapter-by-chapter between two concurrent
   story-lines, with alternating chapter headings of The Doctor and The
   Bodyguard.
