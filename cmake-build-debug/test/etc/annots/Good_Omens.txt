   Aziraphale, an angel (originally a guardian of the gates of Eden), and
   Crowley, a demon (originally the serpent who tempted Eve) have lived on
   Earth since its creation. Over the millennia, they have formed an odd
   friendship and taken a liking to humanity. One night, the forces of
   Hell deliver the infant Antichrist to Crowley, with instructions to
   swap him with the son of an American diplomat stationed in Britain.
   Crowley realizes this means that the Apocalypse is coming and convinces
   Aziraphale to help him postpone it. Together, they influence the
   Antichrist's upbringing so that he can never decide between Good and
   Evil.

   However, due to several misunderstandings at the hospital, the real
   Antichrist is actually another boy, Adam Young, who grows up unnoticed
   in idyllic Lower Tadfield, Oxfordshire, together with his three close
   friends - Pepper, Wensleydale and Brian. As the foretold end of the
   world nears, Adam begins to unknowingly use his reality warping powers,
   changing the world to fit things he reads in a conspiracy theory
   magazine, such as raising the lost continent of Atlantis. In the
   meantime, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse assemble: War (a war
   correspondent), Famine (a dietician and fast-food tycoon), Pollution
   (Pestilence having retired after the discovery of penicillin) and Death
   (a biker).

   Aziraphale and Crowley realize their mistake and begin a frantic search
   for the Antichrist. Also looking for the boy is Anathema Device, a
   witch who is trying to prevent the Apocalypse as predicted by her
   ancestor, Agnes Nutter. Agnes' prophecies are perfectly accurate, but
   so cryptic and specific as to be nearly useless. Anathema is joined by
   Newton Pulsifer, sole recruit of the Witchfinder Army, who has been
   sent to investigate the strange phenomena around Tadfield by his
   Sergeant, Shadwell. Everyone, including Shadwell's medium neighbour,
   Madame Tracy, converge at Tadfield Military Base, where the Four
   Horsemen are starting a world-ending nuclear war by tampering with the
   computer systems.

   Amid the increasing chaos, Adam is overcome with visions of greatness
   and attempts to split the world between his gang. When his friends
   react with horror at what he is becoming, Adam comes to his senses and
   decides to stop the Apocalypse. He and his friends make their way to
   the military base and defeat three of the Four Horsemen, with Death
   accepting defeat and vanishing. A furious Satan starts to ascend to
   Earth, but Adam, having heard that "his father is coming", twists
   reality so that his human foster father arrives instead, then modifies
   everyone's memories of recent events.

   With Armageddon averted, Crowley and Aziraphale muse that this was
   God's plan all along and speculate that the real apocalyptic conflict
   will be between humanity and the combined forces of Heaven and Hell.
   Madame Tracy marries Sergeant Shadwell, who disbands the Witchfinder
   Army. Anathema begins a relationship with Newton and receives a second
   book of Agnes' prophecies, but decides to burn it so as not to be bound
   by them. Finally, Adam uses his powers to evade his father's grounding
   and visit the circus with his friends.
