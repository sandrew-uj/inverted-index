   The narrator is a London businessman named Bedford who withdraws to the
   countryside to write a play, by which he hopes to alleviate his
   financial problems. Bedford rents a small countryside house in Lympne,
   in Kent, where he wants to work in peace. He is bothered every
   afternoon, however, at precisely the same time, by a passer-by making
   odd noises. After two weeks Bedford accosts the man, who proves to be a
   reclusive physicist named Mr. Cavor. Bedford befriends Cavor when he
   learns he is developing a new material, cavorite, which can negate the
   force of gravity.

   When a sheet of cavorite is prematurely processed, it makes the air
   above it weightless and shoots off into space. Bedford sees in the
   commercial production of cavorite a possible source of "wealth enough
   to work any sort of social revolution we fancied; we might own and
   order the whole world".^[4] Cavor hits upon the idea of a spherical
   spaceship made of "steel, lined with glass", and with sliding "windows
   or blinds" made of cavorite by which it can be steered, and persuades a
   reluctant Bedford to undertake a voyage to the Moon; Cavor is certain
   there is no life there.^[5] On the way to the Moon, they experience
   weightlessness, which Bedford finds "exceedingly restful".^[6] On the
   surface of the Moon the two men discover a desolate landscape, but as
   the Sun rises, the thin, frozen atmosphere vaporises and strange plants
   begin to grow with extraordinary rapidity. Bedford and Cavor leave the
   capsule, but in romping about get lost in the rapidly growing jungle.
   They hear for the first time a mysterious booming coming from beneath
   their feet. They encounter "great beasts", "monsters of mere fatness",
   that they dub "mooncalves", and five-foot-high "Selenites" tending
   them. At first they hide and crawl about, but growing hungry partake of
   some "monstrous coralline growths" of fungus that inebriate them. They
   wander drunkenly until they encounter a party of six extraterrestrials,
   who capture them.^[7] The insectoid lunar natives (referred to as
   "Selenites", after Selene, the moon goddess) are part of a complex and
   technologically sophisticated society that lives underground, but this
   is revealed only in radio communications received from Cavor after
   Bedford's return to Earth.

   Bedford and Cavor break out of captivity beneath the surface of the
   Moon and flee, killing several Selenites. In their flight they discover
   that gold is common on the Moon. In their attempt to find their way
   back to the surface and to their sphere, they come upon some Selenites
   carving up mooncalves but fight their way past. Back on the surface,
   they split up to search for their spaceship. Bedford finds it but
   returns to Earth without Cavor, who injured himself in a fall and was
   recaptured by the Selenites, as Bedford learns from a hastily scribbled
   note he left behind.

   Chapter 20, "Mr. Bedford in Infinite Space", plays no role in the plot
   but is a remarkable set piece in which the narrator describes
   experiencing a quasi-mystical "pervading doubt of my own identity. . .
   the doubts within me could still argue: 'It is not you that is reading,
   it is Bedford--but you are not Bedford, you know. That's just where the
   mistake comes in.' 'Counfound it!' I cried, 'and if I am not Bedford,
   what am I? But in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the
   strangest fancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions
   like shadow seem from far away... Do you know I had an idea that really
   I was something quite outside not only the world, but all worlds, and
   out of space and time, and that this poor Bedford was just a peephole
   through which I looked at life..."^[8]

   By good fortune, the narrator lands in the sea off the coast of
   Britain, near the seaside town of Littlestone, not far from his point
   of departure. His fortune is made by some gold he brings back, but he
   loses the sphere when a curious boy named Tommy Simmons climbs into the
   unattended sphere and shoots off into space. Bedford writes and
   publishes his story in The Strand Magazine, then learns that "Mr.
   Julius Wendigee, a Dutch electrician, who has been experimenting with
   certain apparatus akin to the apparatus used by Mr. Tesla in America",
   has picked up fragments of radio communications from Cavor sent from
   inside the Moon. During a period of relative freedom Cavor has taught
   two Selenites English and learned much about lunar society.

   Cavor's account explains that Selenites exist in thousands of forms and
   find fulfilment in carrying out the specific social function for which
   they have been brought up: specialisation is the essence of Selenite
   society. "With knowledge the Selenites grew and changed; mankind stored
   their knowledge about them and remained brutes--equipped," remarks the
   Grand Lunar, when he finally meets Cavor and hears about life on
   Earth.^[9] Unfortunately, Cavor reveals humanity's propensity for war;
   the lunar leader and those listening to the interview are "stricken
   with amazement". Bedford infers that it is for this reason that Cavor
   has been prevented from further broadcasting to Earth. Cavor's
   transmissions are cut off as he is trying to describe how to make
   cavorite. His final fate is unknown, but Bedford is sure that "we shall
   never... receive another message from the moon".^[10]
