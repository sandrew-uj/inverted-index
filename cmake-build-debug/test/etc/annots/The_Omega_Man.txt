   In March 1975, a Sino-Soviet border conflict escalates into full-scale
   war in which biological warfare destroys most of the human race. U.S.
   Army Col. Robert Neville, M.D., is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As
   he begins to succumb to the plague, he injects himself with an
   experimental vaccine, rendering him immune.

   By August 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune
   survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days
   patrolling the now-desolate Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of
   "the Family", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal
   albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill
   Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for
   humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment
   building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in
   his own home.

   One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new
   clothing, he spots a woman, who quickly runs away. He pursues her
   outside, but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the
   sighting.

   On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary
   trial, he is found guilty of heresy by the Family's leader, Jonathan
   Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and
   nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa,
   the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a
   former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of
   survivors, all of whom are children. Although their youth has given
   them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it,
   and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if
   duplicating the original vaccine is possible, salvaging humanity would
   take years. He believes extending his immunity to others may be
   possible by creating a serum from his own blood.

   Neville and Lisa return to Neville's apartment, where they begin
   treating Lisa's brother Richie, who is succumbing to the disease.
   Neville and Lisa are about to have a romantic evening together, just as
   the generator runs out of fuel and the lights go off. The Family then
   attacks, sending Matthias' second-in-command, Brother Zachary, to climb
   up the outside of Neville's building to the open balcony of his
   apartment. Neville leaves Lisa upstairs as he goes to the basement
   garage to restart the generator. Neville returns to the apartment to
   find Zachary right behind an unsuspecting Lisa. Neville shoots him and
   he falls off the balcony to his death, dropping his spear on the
   balcony as he goes.

   If the serum works, Neville and Lisa plan to leave the ravaged city
   with the rest of the survivors, and start new lives in the wilderness,
   leaving the Family behind to die. Neville is successful in creating the
   serum and administers it to Richie. Once cured, Richie reveals the
   Family's headquarters to Neville (the Los Angeles Civic Center), but
   insists that the Family is also human and that Neville's cure should be
   administered to them, as well. Neville disagrees with him, so Richie
   goes to the Family by himself to try to convince them to take the
   serum. Matthias refuses to believe that Neville would try to help them,
   accuses Richie of being sent to spy on them, and has him executed.
   After finding a note that Richie left, Neville rushes to rescue him,
   but instead finds his dead body tied to a judge's chair in a courtroom.

   Meanwhile, Lisa quickly and unexpectedly succumbs to the disease and
   becomes one of the Family. Returning home, Neville tells Lisa about
   Richie's death, but she already knows and has betrayed Neville by
   giving Matthias and his followers access to Neville's home. Matthias,
   who finally has the upper hand, forces Neville to watch as the Family
   sets his home and equipment on fire. Neville breaks free, and once
   outside with Lisa, he turns and raises his gun to shoot Matthias, who
   is looking down from the balcony. The gun jams, giving Matthias enough
   time to hurl Zachary's spear at Neville, mortally wounding him. The
   next morning, Dutch and the survivors discover Neville dying in a
   fountain. He hands Dutch a flask of the blood serum, and then dies.
   Dutch takes Lisa (weakened and compliant because of the sunlight) away,
   and the survivors leave the city forever.
