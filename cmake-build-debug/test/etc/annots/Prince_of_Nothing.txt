   The Prince of Nothing is a series of three fantasy novels by Canadian
   author R. Scott Bakker, first published in 2004, part of a wider series
   known as "The Second Apocalypse". This trilogy details the emergence of
   Anasurimbor Kellhus, a brilliant monastic warrior, as he takes control
   of a holy war and the hearts and minds of its leaders. Kellhus exhibits
   incredible powers of prediction and persuasion, which are derived from
   deep knowledge of rationality, cognitive biases, and causality, as
   discovered by the Dunyain, a secret monastic sect. As Kellhus goes from
   military leader to divine prophet, Drusas Achamian, the sorcerer who
   mentored Kellhus, comes to realize that his student may well be the
   harbinger of the Second Apocalypse.

   The key feature distinguishing the Prince of Nothing series from its
   contemporaries is the importance of philosophy to the work. The plot,
   characters, setting, and metaphysics of the Prince of Nothing are
   intertwined with philosophical positions unique to the series.

   Bakker has mentioned that this series was primarily influenced by the
   works of J. R. R. Tolkien and Frank Herbert.^[1]
