   Earth has been devastated by a nuclear war and it has taken 2 million
   years for the radioactive clouds to once again allow sunlight to reach
   the surface. Only a handful of humans have survived the apocalypse,
   while the rest have changed into mutants who roam the radioactive
   wastelands. Eventually, humanity's true ancestors  - fairies, elves and
   dwarves - resurfaced and live in the idyllic land of Montagar in peace
   for three millennia.

   While her people celebrated 3,000 years of peace, their ruler Delia,
   queen of the fairies, fell into a trance and left the party. Puzzled,
   the fairies followed her to her home and discover that she has given
   birth to twin wizards. They were the kindhearted Avatar who spent much
   of his boyhood entertaining his ailing mother with beautiful visions
   and his mutated brother Blackwolf, who was pure evil, never visiting
   his mother, but spending his time torturing small animals. When
   Blackwolf learned of their mother's death, he attempted to usurp her
   leadership, being defeated in a duel against a grief-stricken Avatar.
   Blackwolf left Montagar with a vow to return and "make this a planet
   where mutants rule".

   3,000 years later, Blackwolf has risen to lead the dark land of
   Scortch, where he and his vast army of goblins, ogres, wraiths, demons,
   dragons, and mutants salvage and restore ancient technology. He tries
   to attack Montagar twice, but is foiled both times when his mutant
   warriors become bored or sidetracked in the midst of battle. Blackwolf
   then discovers an old projector and reels of Nazi propaganda footage
   from WW2, using his magic to enhance it for psychological warfare:
   inspiring his own soldiers while horrifying enemy troops into
   submission.
   Peace, Avatar, Weehawk and Elinore

   Meanwhile, in Montagar, Avatar has become a tutor tasked with training
   the president's daughter, Elinore, to become a full-fledged fairy.
   Suddenly, the president is assassinated by Necron 99, a robot sent by
   Blackwolf to kill all believers in magic. Avatar confronts the robot
   and battles it using brain reading. Necron 99 loses the desire for war
   and Avatar changes his name to Peace "in the hopes that he will bring
   it". Avatar learns from the robot that the "dream machine" - the
   projector - is Blackwolf's secret weapon, inspiring his armies with
   images of ancient warfare. Avatar, Elinore, Peace, and the elf
   berserker Weehawk set out to destroy the projector and save the world
   from another Holocaust.

   In a forest inhabited by fairies, Peace has an intuition that something
   is amiss shortly before the group is accosted by the leader of the
   fairies, Sean. Weehawk realizes that Peace is missing, when an unseen
   assassin kills Sean and kidnaps Elinore. Avatar and Weehawk begin to
   search for Elinore in the forbidden Fairy Sanctuary, but Weehawk falls
   into a chasm and insists that Avatar leave him and find the girl. He
   locates her, captured by fairies and small human-like creatures, just
   as she is about to be killed. Avatar attempts to explain that they did
   not kill Sean, but the fairies do not believe him and shoot him with an
   arrow. Wounded in the shoulder, Avatar refuses to fight back, which
   impresses the fairy king. Instead of executing them, he merely
   teleports Avatar and Elinore to a snowy mountaintop. Avatar and Elinore
   resume their journey, despite the poor conditions, but they soon
   realize that they are wandering in circles. Peace, along with Weehawk
   (who he saved from a vicious monster in the chasm), find Avatar and
   Elinore. Together, they find their way out of the mountains. Soon,
   Avatar and the others encounter the encamped army of an elf General who
   is preparing to attack Scortch the following day, but Blackwolf
   launches a sneak attack that night.

   Elinore is outside with Peace when she accidentally disturbs his
   internal conflict with one of Blackwolf's demons, which Avatar quickly
   dispatches when it attempts to hurt Elinore. But when one of
   Blackwolf's battle tanks arrives to destroy the camp, Elinore kills
   Peace, then manages to disable the crew before she climbs into the tank
   as it drives off with Avatar and Weehawk watching in confusion.

   The next day, Avatar and Weehawk enter Scortch by ship and make for
   Blackwolf's castle, while the General leads his elf warriors in a
   bloody battle to distract Blackwolf's forces. The pair split up,
   Weehawk tracking Elinore while Avatar goes after Blackwolf. Weehawk
   nearly kills Elinore, but she explains that Blackwolf had been
   controlling her mind ever since she first touched Peace. Blackwolf
   declares his magic superior to Avatar's and demands his surrender,
   Avatar admitting that he has not practiced magic for some time and
   offers to show Blackwolf one last trick that their mother showed him
   when Blackwolf was not around. Avatar then pulls a Luger pistol from
   his upper left sleeve and fatally shoots Blackwolf through the heart,
   then a second shot to end Blackwolf's life. With the loss of Blackwolf
   and the projector destroyed, the mutants give up fighting. With
   Montagar's safety secured, Weehawk returns home as the new ruler, while
   Avatar and Elinore decide to start their own kingdom elsewhere.
