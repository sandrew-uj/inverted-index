   The story takes place on the fictional fantasy world of Osten Ard. The
   history of the world and the races present in Osten Ard have a great
   impact on the current events in the books. Thousands of years ago the
   long-lived Gardenborn arrived in the land, fleeing a cataclysm. They
   were three tribes, the Zida'ya (commonly called Sithi), the Hikeda'ya
   (also called Norns) and the Tinukeda'ya (known as Dwarrows and
   Niskies). In Osten Ard the Gardenborn prospered and they built nine
   great cities of tremendous beauty. The first two tribes had ruled the
   third in their ancestral home called the Garden, but in Osten Ard the
   Tinukeda'ya went their own way, developing into two separate tribes,
   the seafaring Niskies and the earth-dwelling Dwarrows. The other two
   tribes also split ways, making a pact at Sesuad'ra, the Stone of
   Farewell. Their main subject of argument was the appearance of Men or
   mortals in Osten Ard. The Zida'ya were content to leave Men alone to go
   their own way, as long as they didn't trespass in Sithi lands. The
   Hikeda'ya were of the opinion that the mortals had to be wiped out or
   driven from Osten Ard. The Norns and their fell queen Utuk'u, eldest
   and most powerful of the Gardenborn, removed to the north of the world,
   taking the two northernmost cities for their own. Three cities were
   also given to the Tinukeda'ya; one was sea-bound Jhina't'senei which
   went to the Niskies and the other two were deep under the earth which
   went to the Dwarrows, the smaller tribe of the Tinukeda'ya. In the
   greatest of them all, Asu'a, the High King ruled.

   But Men began to prosper and advance and the sea empire of Nabban rose
   and fell without it disturbing the Gardenborn. The Sithi also had great
   friendship with the Hernystiri of the west. Then the Rimmersmen came
   with iron and to them the Gardenborn were devils and demons, to be
   killed on sight. Unfortunately the Gardenborn suffer from a severe
   allergy to iron and even with their magics and their own iron-hard
   witchwood weapons, they were beaten back, one after the other. The
   Hernystiri were the only ones who stood by the Sithi in the final
   battle where both armies were destroyed. The remaining Sithi withdrew
   to Asu'a and there awaited the end. Ineluki, the King's younger son,
   wove terrible magic at the end with five of his servants and there they
   and Asu'a were destroyed. However, the spell gave the remaining Sithi
   time to flee to Aldheorte forest, where they continued to live in
   secrecy.

   During the five hundred years that followed the fall of Asu'a, six
   different kings ruled in the castle built on the Sithi ruins, called
   Hayholt. The latest of these is king John Presbyter, who is dying as
   the story opens.

   Simon is an ordinary scullery boy who is taken under the tutelage of
   Morgenes. When King John Presbyter dies and his son Elias ascends the
   throne, the way opens for a long-dormant evil to enter the realm.
   Elias, driven by his evil advisor, moves to eliminate his brother
   Josua. Caught in the struggle, Simon is forced to flee as best he can,
   and the young man soon finds himself taking part in adventures he had
   only dreamed of.
