   Quirk Books editor Jason Rekulak developed the idea for Pride and
   Prejudice and Zombies after comparing a list of "popular fanboy
   characters like ninjas, pirates, zombies, and monkeys" with a list of
   public domain book titles such as War and Peace, Crime and Punishment,
   and Wuthering Heights. He turned the project over to writer
   Seth Grahame-Smith.

      called me one day, out of the blue, very excitedly, and he
     said, "All I have is this title, and I can't stop thinking about
     this title." And he said: "Pride and Prejudice and Zombies". For
     whatever reason, it just struck me as the most brilliant thing I'd
     ever heard.

   Grahame-Smith began with the original text of Austen's novel, adding
   zombie and ninja elements while developing an overall plot line for the
   new material; "you kill somebody off in Chapter 7, it has repercussions
   in Chapter 56". According to the author, the original text of the
   novel was well-suited for use as a zombie horror story:

     You have this fiercely independent heroine, you have this dashing
     heroic gentleman, you have a militia camped out for seemingly no
     reason whatsoever nearby, and people are always walking here and
     there and taking carriage rides here and there ... It was just ripe
     for gore and senseless violence. From my perspective anyway.

   In early 2009, awareness of the forthcoming novel rose due to attention
   from Internet bloggers, newspaper articles, National Public
   Radio, and podcasts. In response, the publisher increased the
   initial print run from 12,000 to 60,000 copies, and moved the
   publication date to April 1.
