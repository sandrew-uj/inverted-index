   The novel starts in 1979, with an abrupt end to an expedition sent by
   Earth Resource Technology Services Inc. in the dense rainforests of the
   Virunga region, in the heart of the Congo, when the team is suddenly
   attacked and killed by unknown creatures - soon, all contact with them
   is lost. The expedition, which was searching for deposits of diamonds,
   discovered the fictional lost city of Zinj. A video image taken by a
   camera there, and transmitted by satellite to the base station in
   Houston, shows a peculiar race of grey-haired gorillas to be
   responsible for the murders.

   Another expedition, led by Karen Ross, is launched to find out the
   truth and to find the Lost City of Zinj, where there are believed to be
   deposits of a certain diamond, the type IIb, which are naturally
   boron-doped and thus useful as semiconductors, though worthless as
   gemstones. This time, the searchers bring along the famous White
   African mercenary Charles Munro, as well as a female gorilla named Amy,
   who has been trained to communicate with humans using sign language,
   and her trainer Peter Elliot.

   Time is of the greatest essence, as a rival consortium from
   corporations in Japan, Germany, and The Netherlands are also searching
   for the diamonds, turning the entire expedition into a race to the city
   of Zinj. Unfortunately for Ross and her team, the American expedition
   encounters many delays along the way, including plane crashes, native
   civil wars, and jungle predators.

   Eventually, Ross and her expedition reach the Lost City of Zinj and
   discover the consortium's camp, like the original expedition's camp, in
   ruins and devoid of life. Ross and her team lose contact with the ERTS
   HQ due to a massive solar flare, then encounter the killer gorillas and
   are attacked. A brief battle ensues and several gorillas are killed.

   After studying the corpses and performing a rudimentary field autopsy,
   it is concluded the animals are not "true" gorillas by modern
   biological standards, nor kakundakari (an African primate cryptid), but
   gorilla/chimpanzee/human hybrids: their mass and height is closer to
   humans than gorillas, their skull is greatly malformed (the "ridge"
   that makes gorilla heads look "pointy" is nearly nonexistent) and their
   pigmentation is on the border of albinism: light gray fur and yellow
   eyes. They also exhibit behavior unlike normal gorillas: they are
   highly aggressive, ruthless and partially nocturnal, as well as
   extremely social, forming troops of over a hundred, compared to a mere
   dozen animals. Elliot intends to name them Gorilla elliotensis after
   himself.

   Afterwards, Ross, Elliot, and Munro explore the ruins and discover that
   the killer gorillas were bred by the ancient inhabitants of Zinj to
   serve as guards to protect the diamond mines from intruders. After
   several more attacks, Elliot, with the help of Amy, finds a way to
   translate the language of the new gorillas (she refers to them as "bad
   gorillas") and piece together three messages ("go away", "don't come",
   "here bad"); they stop fighting the humans and become confused, leaving
   the camp.

   Their victory is cut short by the eruption of the nearby volcano
   (accelerated by explosives placed by Ross for her geological surveys)
   which buries the city, the diamond fields and all proof of the "new"
   species under 800 meters of lava. Ross, Elliot, Munro, and the rest of
   the team's survivors are forced to run for their lives. The team
   manages to find a hot air balloon in a crashed consortium cargo
   aircraft and uses it to escape.

   In an epilogue, it is revealed that Munro was able to retrieve a few
   hundred carats of the valuable diamonds and sold them to Intel for use
   in a revolutionary new computer processor, while Amy was reintroduced
   into the wild and was later observed teaching her offspring sign
   language.
