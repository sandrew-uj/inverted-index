   Dog Soldiers deals with the fall of the counterculture in America, the
   rise of mass cynicism and the end of the optimism of the 1960s.

   California has moved on from the Summer of Love to post-Manson
   paranoia. Converse, a once-promising writer now unable to do more than
   observe, waits for artistic inspiration as a war correspondent in
   Vietnam. Symbolic of his moral corruption is his decision to traffic in
   heroin, which the 1960s counterculture never embraced as they did
   marijuana and LSD.

   Converse involves a former friend, Ray Hicks, in the smuggling deal.
   Hicks will hide the heroin on the Merchant Marine vessel he works on
   when he ships from Vietnam to Oakland, California and deliver the dope
   to Converse's wife Marge in Berkeley, California. The novel's primary
   complication unfolds when Hicks arrives in the States and realizes that
   he was discovered before he arrived and is being aggressively followed.
   Unsure whether Converse was double-crossed by his suppliers or Converse
   himself betrayed him, Hicks elects to go on the run with the heroin,
   taking Marge as insurance. The novel's action follows Hicks and Marge's
   evasion of Converse and his suppliers, and Hicks's attempts to sell the
   dope, south through California to the desert.

   Once an all-American marine, now a lone wolf, Hicks is a survivalist
   and an autodidact trying to apply in himself Zen Buddhism, martial arts
   and the philosophy of Nietzsche. Marge is a painkiller junkie and
   guilt-ridden mother who takes tickets at a porn theater because it is
   ironic; she presents herself as an advocate of freedom, both sexual and
   of speech. She had agreed with Converse to do the heroin deal. Their
   pursuer may intend to arrest them and keep the drugs off of the street,
   or allow his associates to kill them and keep the swag for himself, but
   no one can tell for sure. His thugs may be merely well-informed drug
   thieves or legitimately on the fringe of the law enforcement world.
