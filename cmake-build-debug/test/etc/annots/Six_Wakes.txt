   The Dormire is a starship carrying thousands of prospective colonists
   from Earth to Artemis, a planet in the Tau Ceti star system. All the
   passengers are in coldsleep; only a six-person crew of cloned former
   criminals remains awake through the generations-long journey, each of
   them recloned and reimprinted with their continually updated memories
   as they age and die.

   But something has gone wrong. The latest clone of crew member Maria
   Arena awakens twenty-five years into the voyage to discover her most
   recent self, and those of the rest of the crew, murdered, and her
   accumulated memories of the whole trip wiped. The new clones of the
   other crew members prove equally amnesiac as they awaken, and IAN, the
   ship's guiding artificial intelligence, has been crippled and is taking
   the starship off course.

   The crew of the Dormire has a mystery and crisis to resolve--who has
   murdered their previous selves and sabotaged the voyage, and how can
   they get things back on track? For all they know, the culprit could be
   any one of them. Suspects include Captain Katrina de la Cruz, pilot and
   navigator Akihiro Sato, security chief Wolfgang, engineer Paul Seurat,
   ship's doctor Joanna Glass--and Maria herself.
