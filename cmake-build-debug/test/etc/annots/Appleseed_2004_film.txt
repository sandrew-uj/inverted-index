   Deunan Knute, a young soldier and one of the Global War's last
   survivors, is rescued by Hitomi, a Second Generation Bioroid. Knute's
   escape attempt is stopped by her former lover Briareos Hecatonchires,
   now a cyborg. She realizes that the war had ended and she is in a
   Utopian city called Olympus. Its population is half-human and
   half-clone, a genetically-engineered species called Bioroids. Olympus
   is governed by three factions: Prime Minister Athena Areios; General
   Edward Uranus III, head of the Olympus Army; and a Council of Elders.
   Everything in the city is observed by an artificial intelligence named
   Gaia from a building called Tartaros. While there, Deunan joins the
   counter-terrorism organization ESWAT.

   The Bioroids were created from the DNA of Deunan's late father, Carl,
   making the Second Generation Bioroids her brothers and sisters.
   However, they have a much shorter lifespan than humans due to
   suppressed reproductive capabilities. The Bioroid's life extension
   facilities are destroyed by a secret faction of the Regular Army in a
   terrorist attack against the Bioroids. However, the Appleseed data,
   which contains information on restoring the Bioroids reproduction
   capabilities, still exists.

   Olympus is plagued by conflicting factions. Along with a strike force,
   Deunan and Briareos head to the building where the Bioroids were
   originally created. She activates a holographic recording showing the
   location of the Appleseed data. Dr. Gilliam Knute, who created the
   Bioroids and revealed to be Deunan's mother, entrusted Appleseed to
   Deunan, but was inadvertently killed by a soldier. After mourning her
   death, Leyton turns against his men. They then get cornered by the
   Regular Army. Deunan discovers from anti-Bioroid terrorist Colonel
   Hades that Briareos had intentionally allowed his Landmate, a large
   exoskeleton-like battlesuit, to escape. Kudoh then sacrifices himself
   to get Deunan and Briareos out of harm's way and escape to the rooftop.
   Uranus attempts to convince Deunan that Bioroids seek to control
   humanity, and he wants to destroy Appleseed and the D-Tank containing
   the Bioroid reproductive activation mechanism. Briareos tells Uranus
   that the Elders manipulated the Army into wanting to destroy the
   D-Tank, but Athena is trying to prevent them from doing so and protect
   humanity. Hades, who resents Carl, wounds Briareos. She and Briareos
   flee into the sea, killing Hades in the process. Despite Deunan's pleas
   not to leave Briareos behind, he persuades her to search for the
   Elders. Mechanic Yoshitsune Miyamoto arrives in his Landmate and begins
   repairing Briareos after receiving an SOS from him. Deunan flies back
   to Olympus in Yoshitsune's Landmate and uses the Appleseed data to
   fully restore Bioroid reproductive functions.

   As Deunan encounters the Council of Elders, they reveal their
   involvement in Gilliam's death and also plan to use the D-tank virus to
   sterilize humans, which will leave the Bioroids the new rulers of
   Earth. They needed the Appleseed data to keep the Bioroids alive, but
   Gilliam hid the data so they could not move forward with their plan.
   Athena, stepping in to stop them and announcing that Uranus has
   surrendered, tells Deunan that the Elders had been acting on their own
   and had shut Gaia down once they realized humanity had softened their
   stance against Bioroids. The Elders state that they will soon die since
   Gaia kept them alive, but that they were ready to sacrifice themselves.
   They then activate the city's mobile fortress defenses, which begin
   marching towards Tartaros. Athena states that D-tank's security system
   is nearly impenetrable, but a shot from the fortresses' main cannons
   might puncture the tank, releasing the virus. ESWAT begins mobilizing,
   but suffer heavy casualties due to the fortresses' heavy weaponry.

   Briareos arrives and asks Deunan to join the battle. Despite the
   Elders' objections, she goes with him to the seventh tower, and
   attempts to enter the password to shut the defenses down, but a
   malfunction makes it difficult. The final password letter appears by
   itself, and Deunan secures the D-Tank, shutting down the towers. She
   reveals that the sins of humanity will probably get worse, but that
   there is always the chance that future generations will learn from
   these mistakes; she vows to keep fighting for the children.
