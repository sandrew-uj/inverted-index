   After Tatischev's publications, Vadim became one of the most popular
   characters in the 18th-century Russian literature. Yakov Knyazhnin, a
   leading playwright, penned a play in which he contrasted Vadim, a
   defender of Novgorod's ancient freedom, with the authoritarian Rurik.
   When the play appeared in 1791, Catherine the Great was enraged,
   although she had fictionalized Vadim's struggle against Rurik in one of
   her own plays. Against the background of the French Revolution,
   Knyazhnin was accused of Jacobinism and all printed copies of his play
   were to be burnt.
