   Wild Seed is the story of two immortal Africans named Doro and Anyanwu.
   Doro is a spirit who can inhabit other people's bodies, killing anyone
   and anything in his path, while Anyanwu is a woman with healing powers
   who can transform herself into any human or animal. When they meet,
   Doro senses Anyanwu's abilities and wants to add her to one of his seed
   villages in the New World, where he breeds super humans. Doro convinces
   Anyanwu to travel with him to America by telling her he will give her
   children she will never have to watch die. Although Doro plans to
   impregnate her himself, he also wants to share her with his son Isaac.
   Isaac has very strong telekinetic powers and is one of Doro's most
   successful seeds. By partnering Anyanwu and Isaac together, Doro hopes
   to obtain children with very special abilities.

   Doro discovers that when Anyanwu transforms into an animal, he cannot
   sense or kill her. Feeling threatened by her shape-shifting ability, he
   wonders whether he holds enough control over her. Anyanwu witnesses
   Doro's barbaric ways and plain disregard for his people, which
   frightens her. When they arrive at the seed village, Doro tells Anyanwu
   that she is to marry Isaac, and bear his children and the children of
   whomever else Doro chooses. Anyanwu eventually agrees once Isaac
   convinces her that she could be the only one to get through to Doro.

   Fifty years later, Doro returns to the seed village. His relationship
   with Anyanwu has deteriorated, and one of the only things keeping him
   from killing her is her successful marriage to Isaac. He has come home
   because he senses that Anyanwu's daughter, Nweke, is fully coming into
   her powers. During her transition, Nweke attacks Anyanwu. Trying to
   protect Anyanwu, Isaac accidentally kills Nweke and suffers a heart
   attack. Anyanwu realizes she is too weak to heal Isaac and he dies.
   Afraid that Doro will kill her now that Isaac is not there to protect
   her, Anyanwu transforms into an animal and runs away.

   After a century, Doro finally tracks Anyanwu down to a Louisiana
   plantation. To his surprise, Anyanwu has created her own colony, which
   in many ways is more successful than Doro's. She protects her people
   until Doro's arrival, at which point he forces his breeding program on
   her community. One man he brings to mate with one of Anyanwu's
   daughters ruins the harmony of the colony, resulting in several deaths.
   Anyanwu becomes tired of Doro's control, since his immortality makes
   him the only permanent thing in her life. She decides to commit
   suicide. Her decision causes Doro to have a change of heart. In
   desperation, he agrees to compromise as long as she continues to live.
   From that point on, Doro no longer kills as carelessly to remain
   immortal, and does not choose his kills from the people that he should
   be protecting. He also stops using Anyanwu to breed; from now on she
   helps him in his quest to try to find more promising seeds, but is more
   of an ally and partner than his slave.
