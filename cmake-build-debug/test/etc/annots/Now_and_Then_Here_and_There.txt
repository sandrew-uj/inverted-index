   While walking home from school, "Shu", the main protagonist and a boy
   who loves Kendo, intercedes to protect a girl, Lala-Ru, who is attacked
   by abductors piloting dragon-like mechas and is accidentally
   transported to the attackers' world as a result -- a wasteland devoid
   of water and dominated by a red giant star. Lala-Ru possesses a pendant
   containing a vast reservoir of water, and she has the ability to
   control it.

   Shu is trapped in this new, harsh reality, and he is beaten and
   interrogated repeatedly inside the warship commanded by the ruthless,
   manic dictator, Hamdo. While locked in a cell he meets an abducted girl
   who introduces herself as Sara Ringwalt of America. Sara's reason for
   her capture was being mistaken for Lala-Ru by Hamdo's minions. Sara is
   forced into the quarters of exceptional soldiers to be impregnated and
   is traumatized by her repeated rape. After an assault by an unknown
   enemy landship, Shu is forced to join an army of child soldiers;
   children trained for the looting of villages, in which they kidnap
   female villagers for breeding, and conscript orphaned male children
   into the ever dwindling ranks of Hamdo's army.

   Much of the series deals with serious moral issues relating to war and
   famine, the consequences of war, slavery, rape, and the exploitation of
   children.
