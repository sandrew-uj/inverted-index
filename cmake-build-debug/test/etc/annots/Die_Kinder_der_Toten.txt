   The novel is unusual amongst literary works in German in that all the
   characters are undead in the process of decomposition and are presented
   as mute zombies in the manner of splatter films. Of these undead
   protagonists, the three primary are Gudrun Bichler, Edgar Gstranz and
   Karin Frenzel; they are incapable of speech, obsessed with sex, and
   brutal. They are confronted with the mass of Holocaust victims, who
   wish to achieve new life by means of the couple, Gudrun and Edgar;
   however their plan fails since Gudrun and Edgar are likewise undead.
   The setting dissolves into a sea of mud.
