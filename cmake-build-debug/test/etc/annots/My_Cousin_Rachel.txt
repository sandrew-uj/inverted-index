   Ambrose Ashley is the owner of a large country estate on the Cornish
   coast and has been guardian to his orphaned cousin Philip since Philip
   was three years old. On Sundays, Philip's godfather, Nick Kendall, and
   his daughter Louise come to lunch with them, as do the Reverend Mr
   Pascoe and his family. Life is good apart from a few health problems
   that require Ambrose to spend the winter in warmer climates. As the
   damp weather approaches, he sets off for his third winter abroad and
   chooses Italy.

   By the time he has reached his twenties, Philip misses Ambrose on his
   sojourns in Italy but regularly receives letters from him. Ambrose
   writes that he has met a cousin of theirs called Rachel -- the widowed
   Contessa Sangalletti -- in Florence. In the spring, Ambrose says that
   he and Rachel are married and have no immediate plans to return to
   Cornwall. Gradually, the tone of Ambrose's correspondence changes. He
   complains of the sun, the stuffy atmosphere of the Villa Sangalletti,
   and terrible headaches. In a letter that reaches Philip in July,
   Ambrose says that a friend of Rachel's called Rainaldi has recommended
   that Ambrose see a different doctor. Ambrose says he can trust no one
   and claims that Rachel watches him constantly.

   Philip discusses the contents of the letter with his godfather Nick,
   who is his guardian until his coming of age at 25. Nick suggests that
   Ambrose may be suffering from a brain tumour. Philip travels to Italy
   and reaches the Villa Sangalletti, where he learns that Ambrose is dead
   and that Rachel has left the villa. When Philip returns to Cornwall,
   Nick tells Philip that he has received a communication from Rainaldi,
   containing two pieces of information: the death certificate confirms
   that Ambrose's cause of death was a brain tumour, and, as Ambrose had
   never changed his will in Rachel's favour, Philip is still heir to the
   estate.

   Two weeks later, Nick receives word from Rachel, saying that she has
   arrived by boat at Plymouth. Philip invites her to stay with him, and a
   harmony develops between them. One day, a tenant from East Lodge gives
   Philip a letter from Ambrose, written three months before his death. In
   it, Ambrose tells Philip about his illness and talks of Rachel's
   recklessness with money and her habit of turning to Rainaldi rather
   than himself. Finally, he wonders if they are trying to poison him, and
   he asks Philip to come to see him. Rachel later shows Philip an
   unsigned will that Ambrose wrote in which he leaves his property to
   Rachel. Philip begins to trust Rachel again.

   On the day before Philip's 25th birthday, he prepares to transfer
   Ambrose's estate to Rachel. He also gives her the family jewels, and
   they make love. The next day, Philip announces that he and Rachel are
   getting married, but she denies this in front of friends. Not long
   afterward, Philip falls ill for many weeks, during which Rachel nurses
   him. When he is well enough to go outside, he finds that the terraced
   gardens are complete and that work has begun on a sunken garden. The
   foreman tells Philip that the bridge over the garden is a framework and
   will not bear any weight.

   Philip suspects that Rachel tried to poison him and, with Louise's
   help, searches her room. They find nothing to incriminate Rachel and
   wonder if they are misjudging her. Meanwhile, Rachel has walked to the
   terraced garden and stepped onto the bridge over the sunken garden.
   Philip finds her broken body lying amongst the timber and stone. He
   takes her in his arms, and she looks at him, calling him Ambrose before
   she dies.

   The book's title reflects Philip's consistent references to Rachel as
   "my cousin Rachel" up to the moment he realises that he is in love with
   her.
