   The documentary proposes a thought experiment in which a neutron star
   approaches Earth. Constant meteor storms are the first warning sign,
   and dramatic sequences depict widespread destruction and the deaths of
   thousands of people. Given seventy-five years to prepare, human society
   radically shifts toward the evacuation of Earth. The propulsion system
   for the spacecraft is the first problem to be addressed. In a dramatic
   sequence, the world's leading experts debate the benefits and drawbacks
   of various methods. Conventional rockets are too slow, and antimatter
   engines are too unstable; they eventually settle on nuclear pulse
   propulsion, as originally suggested by Project Orion. The world's
   engineers, scientists, and manufacturing workers begun work at a new
   site in Florida, dubbed Starship City. Interviewed experts propose that
   fatalism may drive some people either to suicide or radicalism and
   attempts to sabotage the project. In one dramatic sequence, terrorists
   strike the facility, though they are destroyed by a hidden minefield.
   Brush fire conflicts also escalate, as security forces are focused on
   either maintaining order or protecting the interstellar project's
   facilities and personnel.

   Who is to be evacuated is another major issue. Although diversity is
   respected, any selected individual would have to be genetically hardy
   and not predisposed toward disease (such as schizophrenia and
   diabetes). In dramatic sequences, a second ark ship is announced amid
   controversy, as it is reserved for the world's wealthiest and most
   powerful families willing to pay for passage. Simulated newscasts
   announce delays and setbacks as scientists are lured to the private ark
   ship. As the neutron star enters our solar system, Saturn is destroyed,
   and the Earth experiences calamitous shifts in its seasons and bursts
   of radiation leading to fatalities and ecological damage. The private
   ark ship, equipped with an antimatter engine, explodes when its
   antimatter containment fails. Families are potentially broken up as
   they prepare to board the remaining ark ship, and experts discuss the
   basic necessities for human life: bacteria, air, water, and food.
   Bacteria are easily stored, and air is synthesized from water. Food,
   however, remains a difficult problem, and experts propose that
   colonists will eat insects and algae, which are easily replenished and
   space efficient. They also propose that the oxygen and water produced
   by agriculture, trees, grass and other plant life will produce its own
   weather and biosphere about 60-80 years into the ship's journey.

   The ark ship launches and quickly speeds away, a few days later the
   neutron star is close enough that its tidal force begins to deform the
   Earth's core and the crust, which causes massive earthquakes and
   volcanism. Next, the gravity from the neutron star tears away the
   surface, causing the crust to shatter and the hot interior of Earth to
   spill out into the vacuum of space, destroying the Earth, but only the
   colonists on the ark can witness this event, as the rest of humanity
   had already been wiped out. The colonists continue their journey to
   Barnard's Star; experts discuss the potential for mutiny and
   factionalism, ultimately rejecting them as unlikely, as strong family
   and societal bonds will be emphasized. The journey is estimated to take
   approximately eighty-eight years, and the youngest of the original crew
   survive to see the new planet, which potentially harbors other
   lifeforms. Experts conclude that the scenario, though unlikely, is
   possible and requires preparation from the world's governments.
