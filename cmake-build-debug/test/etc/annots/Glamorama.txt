   In 1999, the contemporary Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero wrote a
   composition for chamber ensemble entitled Glamorama Spies, which was
   inspired by the novel.

     In Glamorama by Bret Easton Ellis, the main character is constantly
     spied on and, even before his consciousness becomes aware of it, he
     is constantly in an anxious state. Anxiolytics and some romantic
     intervals are not enough to stop the sensation that he's always late
     for something and that he's progressively losing his sense of
     reality. I was reading the book when Sentieri selvaggi asked me for
     this piece and going from reading to writing seemed almost
     inevitable. Therefore, if at times you feel some hints at emotion,
     think about the second to last sentence of the book: "The stars are
     real."

   -- Lorenzo Ferrero

   Glitterati is a 2004 film directed by Roger Avary assembled from the 70
   hours of video footage shot for the European sequence of The Rules of
   Attraction. It expands upon the minimally detailed and rapidly recapped
   story told by Victor Ward, portrayed by Kip Pardue, upon his return to
   the United States after having travelled extensively around Europe. In
   regard to expanding upon those events, the film acts as a connecting
   bridge between The Rules of Attraction and the upcoming film adaptation
   set to be directed by Avary. Avary has called
   Glitterati a "pencil sketch of what will ultimately be the oil painting
   of Glamorama."

   In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of Glamorama, narrated
   by Jonathan Davis, as part of its Modern Vanguard line of audiobooks.

   In 2010, when a film adaptation of Glamorama was mentioned in an
   interview with Movieline.com, Bret Easton Ellis commented, "I think the
   days of being able to make that movie are over." From the same
   interview, Ellis mentioned that an idea for a mini-series adaptation
   was brought forth to HBO though it was ultimately declined and further
   stating the movie would be left in Roger Avary's hands if one was to be
   made.

   On October 13, 2011, Bret Easton Ellis reported on Twitter the
   following:

     Just finished reading Roger Avary's adaptation of "Glamorama" which
     he will direct next year. Hilarious, horrific, sad. He's a mad
     genius.
