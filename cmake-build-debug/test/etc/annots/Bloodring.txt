   The story take place about a century after an apocalypse. It includes
   "neomages", a new race of beings that arose during the time of the
   apocalypse. They live in an area known as the Enclave, which is both a
   prison and sanctuary, and are able to work with "leftover creation
   energy".

   Thorn St. Croix is a neomage in exile from the Enclave. Thorn (unlike
   most mages) is telepathic, and she constantly hears the thoughts of the
   other mages in the Enclave. This threatened to drive her insane when it
   began during her adolescence and forced her to live amongst humans
   whose thoughts she does not hear.

   Because mages without a special license are not allowed amongst the
   human population, Thorn must hide her true nature lest she be killed,
   either by the humans - who would torture her first - or by the seraphs
   who have ruled the earth since the apocalypse began.

   Thorn is a "stone mage", and channels her talents with stone into
   lapidary work and jewelry-making, running the store, Thorn's Gems, with
   her partners, Rupert and Jaycee, in the small town of Mineral City,
   Carolina, where they all live.

   Thorn's life is suddenly disrupted when police officer Thaddeus
   Bartholomew comes to her door and announces that her ex-husband Lucas,
   (who is also Rupert's brother) has been kidnapped. She is a suspect.
   Thadd, it turns out, is a kylen, progeny of a seraph and a mix of human
   and mage. Thorn realizes this when he "kindles" her mage-heat.
   Amazingly, Thadd appears not to know he is anything but pure human, and
   were he to discover her secret, he would immediately arrest her for
   being an unlicensed mage outside of Enclave. She must risk death in
   order to save the father of her former stepdaughter, Ciana - the child
   of her heart.
