   1-4: Trevor Jamieson is stranded in a deadly jungle on the planet
   Eristan II with an ezwal, a 3-ton, six-legged saurian-like creature
   that dislikes humans and wants them to leave his native world, Carson's
   Planet. Having bailed out of a crashing spaceship, Jamieson and the
   telepathic ezwal must make their way to the wreckage in hopes that the
   subspace radio survived and they can call for help. Their journey is
   interrupted by a cruiser belonging to the Rull, creatures that appear
   to have evolved from chameleon-like worms and who are implacably
   hostile to all intelligent life. The Rull capture the ezwal, but must
   lie hidden when a Terran battleship engages their cruiser. When a
   native plant kills the Rull, the ezwal guides Jamieson to their
   lifeboat and Jamieson flies the two of them to safety.

   5: Jamieson arranges to return the ezwal to Carson's Planet. As they
   part, the ezwal rejects Jamieson's request that the ezwals develop a
   mechanical civilization capable of fending off the Rull. Jamieson finds
   a similar intransigence in the human settlers, all of whom have had
   family members killed by ezwals. One young woman tells him that
   Carson's Planet's moon is habitable and offers to guide him on tour of
   it.

   6-7: On Carson's Satellite Barbara Whitman leads Jamieson into a trap.
   Her plan fails to kill Jamieson, but they are both stranded on a
   hostile world. They begin walking back toward the city whence they came
   and Jamieson uses his wilderness survival skills to obtain food for
   them and save them from a blood-sucking gryb. Several days later the
   crew of his ship finds and rescues them.

   8-13: Jamieson had been concerned about a female ezwal and her cub
   being taken to Earth. The ship carrying the ezwals crash lands in
   Alaska and a crewman kills the mother, who kills him before she dies.
   The cub manages to escape and is pursued over the landscape by men who
   believe he is merely an animal. Jamieson comes as the men are closing
   in and with the ezwal's cooperation convinces the men that the ezwal is
   an intelligent being and persuades them not to kill him.

   14-16: Jamieson is organizing a project on the planet Mira 23 to obtain
   a fluid from a native lifeform in order to create a substance that will
   poison the Rull. Kidnaped by Rull agents, he is taken to Mira 23, where
   he will be used to frame the project's leader for his murder. He is
   left in the forest, where the lethal fauna will kill him, though the
   three Rull agents are killed by a menace they did not anticipate.
   Jamieson is then rescued by the project's leader.

   17-19: In Solar City Jamieson's son Diddy is on a quest to find the
   source of an all-pervasive sound. During the all-night quest he is
   accompanied by Rull spies and saboteurs, who use him to gain access to
   The Yards, where a giant spaceship is being built. With the aid of
   counterspies and the ezwal cub, he obtains a flame gun and kills the
   saboteurs. Then he completes his quest.

   20: With the ezwal cub accompanying him, Jamieson goes to the planet
   Ploia to capture one of the natives. Made up entirely of
   electromagnetic fields, the Ploian sends electrical systems into a
   frenzy, so Jamieson must use purely mechanical devices to control his
   ship. Through the ezwal's telepathic ability, he makes contact with the
   Ploian, which agrees to help him in return for a promise to take it
   home.

   21-25: Jamieson has gone directly from Ploia to Laertes III to make a
   preliminary survey of the planet as a base of operations against the
   Rull. A Rull survey boat disables his lifeboat but is itself shot down.
   Jamieson must then engage the Rull in a battle of wits for ten days. In
   that time he manages to condition the Rull with a subconscious belief
   that the war is futile. At the end the Rull captures him, but the
   Ploian frees him and they go home in a Rull lifeboat. The Rull Jamieson
   confronted turns out to have been a Prime Leader and he does, indeed,
   end the war.
