   Cities in Flight is a four-volume series of science fiction novels and
   short stories by American writer James Blish, originally published
   between 1950 and 1962, which were first known collectively as the
   "Okie" novels. The series features entire cities that are able to fly
   through space using an anti-gravity device, the spindizzy. The stories
   cover roughly two thousand years, from the very near future to the end
   of the universe. One story, "Earthman, Come Home" won a Retro Hugo
   Award in 2004 for Best Novelette.^[1] Since 1970, the primary edition
   has been the omnibus volume first published in paperback by Avon
   Books.^[2] Over the years James Blish made many changes to these
   stories in response to points raised in letters from readers.
