   Some time, a little over 10,000 years from now, a noblewoman gives
   birth to a deformed child, a consequence of having been accidentally
   exposed to radiation from one of the temples of the Atom Gods. The baby
   is kept alive because one of the atom priests wants to conduct an
   experiment to see what will happen if the boy, unlike other mutant
   children, is given the full education of an atom priest.

   In his teens the mutant boy Clane helps his father win a war with Mars.
   He also continues his studies while his grandfather, who is Lord
   Leader, and his tutors protect him from the Machiavellian intrigues
   swirling around him, especially those of his grandmother Lydia.

   Reaching his majority, Clane turns his estate into a laboratory where
   he can test new inventions and machines that he has retrieved from the
   ruins of ancient cities and reactivated. When his grandfather dies,
   Clane becomes a target for assassination, but shortly thereafter Lady
   Lydia receives a vase containing the assassin's ashes. Even a direct
   frontal assault by a militia fails against Clane and Lady Lydia is
   compelled to cease her attacks on him.

   A war between the Linnan Empire and rebels on Venus provides an
   opportunity for Clane to take an expedition to explore the ruins of an
   ancient city there. When the Venusians capture the Lord Advisor and
   thousands of his troops and prepare to hang them, Clane appears in
   their camp and displays the awesome power of the Atom Gods. With the
   war won, Clane returns to Earth with his findings.

   In spite of Clane's warnings, the Linnan Empire is taken by surprise by
   an invasion of barbarians from Europa, the largest of Jupiter's moons.
   The invaders kill the Lord Advisor and Clane must take command of the
   imperial forces. Disguised as a slave, Clane sneaks into his townhouse
   in the city of Linn and touches an artifact that he found on Venus.
   With the power it gives him he compels the barbarian chieftain,
   Czinczar, to surrender, but not before Czinczar shows him the body of
   an alien, one of a species that Czinczar believes caused the cataclysm
   that devastated human civilization thousands of years before. The
   Europan threat is vanquished, but now Clane has a new worry.

   The story continues and concludes in The Wizard of Linn.
