   Martin Gibson, a famous science fiction author, is travelling to Mars,
   as a guest of the crew of the spaceship Ares. After arriving at Space
   Station One, in the orbit of Earth, from which all interplanetary
   journeys start, he begins the three-month trip to Mars.

   The youngest crew member, Jimmy Spencer, who is still in training to be
   an astronaut, is assigned the task of answering his questions about the
   technology of space flight, and they become friends. Gibson tells him
   about his early life, revealing that he had to leave Cambridge
   University because of a nervous breakdown and never completed his
   studies. After psychiatric treatment, he had become an author. He also
   reveals that he had an affair at university but that he and his
   girlfriend broke up and that she married another man, had a child and
   later died.

   On Mars, Gibson and the crew go their separate ways. Gibson meets the
   Chief Executive of Mars, Warren Hadfield, and Mayor Whittaker, who run
   the colony from the base at Port Lowell. He discusses the future of the
   colony with Hadfield, who is keen to make Mars as self-sufficient as
   possible, given the vast distance that materials have to come from
   Earth.

   On a trip by passenger jet to an outlying research station, Gibson and
   the crew are forced down by a dust storm. They explore the nearby area
   and discover a small group of kangaroo-like creatures, the unsuspected
   natives of Mars. They appear to have limited intelligence by human
   standards and are vegetarians, living on native plants.

   It is later revealed that the plants are being cultivated by
   researchers to enrich the oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere.
   This project, and related others, are being kept secret from Earth.

   Gibson discovers that Spencer is his son. In the meantime, Spencer has
   formed an attachment to Irene, Hadfield's daughter.

   Hadfield reveals that scientists have been working on "Project Dawn",
   which involves the ignition of the moon Phobos and its use as a second
   "sun" for Mars. It will burn for at least one thousand years and the
   extra heat, together with mass production of the oxygen-generating
   plants, will eventually - it is hoped - make the Martian atmosphere
   breathable for humans.

   Gibson finds himself so persuaded of the importance of Mars as a
   self-sufficient world that he applies to stay on the planet, and is
   invited to take charge of public relations - in effect, to "sell" Mars
   to potential colonists.
