   Vortex is initially set during bilateral negotiations to end apartheid
   in South Africa during the early 1990s. Despite conservative
   opposition, the ruling National Party and newly elected State President
   Frederick Haymans secretly discuss options for reform with the African
   National Congress (ANC). However, beneath the surface tensions remain
   high, with both parties facing immense pressure from their radical
   wings and internal resistance to apartheid escalating. The National
   Party is unwilling to consider a universal franchise, which forms the
   crux of the ANC's demands, while for its part the ANC refuses to cease
   planning guerrilla operations.
