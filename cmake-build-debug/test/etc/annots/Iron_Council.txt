   Iron Council follows three major narrative threads that join to form
   the novel's climax. Although Mieville weaves back and forth between
   narrative, time and space, this summary will follow each narrative
   individually, discussing their relation to each other toward the end.
   The novel is set in and around New Crobuzon, a sprawling London-esque
   city. New Crobuzon has for some unknown time been at war with Tesh, and
   is attempting to build a railroad across the outlying desert, partially
   as a new means of conducting this war. Against this backdrop, the novel
   follows the deeds of three main characters--Ori, Cutter and Judah Low.

   Judah's story begins some 20 years before the novel's opening. Judah
   was hired as a railroad scout for New Crobuzon, charged with mapping
   terrain and informing the land's inhabitants of the railroad's coming.
   While doing so, he spends time with the Stiltspear, a race of
   indescribable creatures who can conjure golems, living creatures made
   from unliving matter. Judah attempts to warn the Stiltspear away, but
   they will not listen and he must settle for making a few recordings and
   beginning to learn their golemetric arts. Eventually, he returns to the
   railroad, which does indeed wipe out the Stiltspear. Shortly afterward,
   Judah, a sex worker named Ann-Hari, and a Remade named Uzman lead a
   revolution in which the rail workers drive the overseers away, free the
   Remade, and hijack the train, transforming it into a moving socialist
   dwelling.

   Iron Council, the perpetual train, moves through the desert, gathering
   track from behind and laying it in whichever direction its citizens
   decide. The Council keeps moving to avoid the New Crobuzon militia, who
   are anxious to reclaim the train and destroy the rebellion-inspiring
   Council. Judah returns to New Crobuzon, where he immerses himself in
   esoteric golemetry literature, emerging as a master of the art.
   Eventually, Judah returns to the Iron Council, having spread its word
   throughout New Crobuzon, intent on using his golemetry to protect it.

   Cutter, whom the reader joins at the novel's opening, was a friend,
   disciple, and lover to Judah during Judah's return to New Crobuzon. He
   leads a group consisting of other disciples of Judah in search of the
   Iron Council to warn of an impending attack by the New Crobuzon
   militia. After living and working with the Council for a while, Cutter
   returns with Judah and others to New Crobuzon to inspire revolt with
   the news of Iron Council, which has decided to return to the city and
   confront the militia on its own turf. In their travels they meet
   Qurabin, a monk of the Moment of the Hidden and Lost, who continually
   trades aspects of himself in return for whatever knowledge he needs
   (over the course of the novel, Qurabin loses his native language,
   various memories, and finally his eyes to help the protagonists).

   Meanwhile, dissatisfied revolutionary Ori is led by a half-crazed old
   homeless man named Spiral Jacobs to join the militant gang of Toro.
   Committing robberies, raids, and even murder, Toro's group proceeds
   mercilessly on its quest to assassinate the mayor of New Crobuzon, a
   plan which is later revealed to be personal rather than political.
   During Ori's struggles with and against his new gang, an uprising by
   the Collective, a union of revolutionary groups, threatens to finally
   wrest New Crobuzon from the hands of its corrupt parliament and
   militia. After several days of fighting, however, the Collective is
   destroyed. Ori then learns that Spiral Jacobs is actually a powerful
   sorcerer sent by Tesh to introduce a dark, destructive force into the
   midst of New Crobuzon. Here Judah, Ori, and Cutter unite to stop Jacobs
   with the help of Qurabin, who takes the Tesh ambassador with him 'into
   the domain of Tekke Vogu'. Ori is killed in the confrontation.

   In light of the collapse of the Collective, Judah sends Cutter to
   dissuade Iron Council from returning. He is unsuccessful, and Judah
   conjures a time-golem to freeze the train in time to save its citizens.
   Ann Hari murders Judah shortly thereafter for thwarting the attack. As
   the novel ends, Iron Council has become a public monument of sorts,
   poised on the verge of attacking New Crobuzon until the unknown moment
   when the time golem dissipates. Cutter re-immerses himself in New
   Crobuzon's underground resistance movements, revitalising the protest
   publication Runagate Rampant.
