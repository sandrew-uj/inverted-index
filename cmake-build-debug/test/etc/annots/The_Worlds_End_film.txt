   Gary King, a forty-year-old alcoholic, retains the mindset and
   immaturity of his teenage years, whereas his four boyhood friends,
   Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page, Steven Prince, and Andrew Knightley,
   have all matured. The four have become estranged from Gary until one
   day, attempting to recapture his youth, he contacts and invites them to
   complete the "Golden Mile", a pub crawl encompassing the twelve pubs of
   their hometown of Newton Haven, the last of them being the World's End.
   The group attempted the crawl as teens, twenty-three years previously
   on their last day of school, but failed to reach the final three pubs.
   Andy, now a teetotaller due to a drunk-driving accident years ago
   involving him and Gary, reluctantly agrees to join the others.

   At the second pub, the Old Familiar, the group encounters Oliver's
   sister, Sam, who Gary and Steven fought over in school; in the teenage
   crawl, Gary had sex with Sam in the toilets of the seventh pub, the Two
   Headed Dog. Early into the crawl, the town residents appear eerily
   stoic and do not seem to recognize the group, except for the barman of
   the third pub, The Famous Cock, who tells them that they are banned. In
   the fourth pub, the Cross Hands, the group begins berating Gary for his
   childishness and lack of empathy when he interrupts a tragic story from
   Peter. Angry and upset, Gary goes to the toilet where he gets into a
   fight with a teenager and knocks his head off, exposing him as an
   android. As Gary's friends find him in the bathroom, initially to
   confront him about lying about his mother's death, the other members of
   the teen's gang, all of whom are also androids filled with a blue
   ink-like substance, enter the bathroom and engage in a battle against
   the human friends. The group realizes that the entire town has been
   replaced with android simulants. In shock, Andy abandons his teetotal
   lifestyle.

   Gary urges them to continue the pub crawl to avoid suspicion. At the
   Trusty Servant, Gary and his friends learn that the androids want to
   improve humanity after Gary tries to buy some "herbal refreshment",
   discovering that drug dealer Trevor is in league with the androids.
   Oliver is put out of commission after pint six, being replaced by an
   android look-alike while he used the bathroom off-screen. The group
   bumps into Sam once more at the Two Headed Dog, where Gary, Sam, and
   Steven fight a pair of twin androids. She tags along with them to the
   Mermaid, where Steven discovers that the androids are trying to build a
   prosperous, galactic conglomerate, with humanity working alongside
   them, and that any humans refusing will be replaced with identical
   simulants. When the group arrives at the Beehive, the androids attempt
   to convince the humans to join their assimilation. Unwilling to lose
   their humanity and finding out that Oliver had been replaced, the
   situation and Andy go mental as the group fights against the world.

   After escaping the Beehive, the situation worsens. Gary lets Sam, the
   only one sober enough to drive safely, go to escape Newton Haven
   herself; Pete gets captured after attacking the android that replaced
   his childhood bully; and, when Andy and Steven want to go home as a
   result, Gary ditches them at the King's Head to finish the Golden Mile.
   Andy and Steven chase after Gary with the rest of Newton Haven,
   although Steven gets captured at the Hole in the Wall after attempting
   to drive the remaining humans out of town.

   Andy finally catches up to Gary at the World's End and confronts him,
   provoking a fight. During their scuffle, Andy shares that his marriage
   is troubled and Gary's wrists reveal a recent suicide attempt. Andy
   tries to stop Gary from drawing his final pint, but Gary clings to
   completing the Mile, saying it is the only thing in life he can
   achieve.

   When Gary pulls the lever to pour himself a pint, the floor lowers to a
   hidden chamber. A disembodied alien entity, known as the Network, tells
   them that the simulant invasion has been responsible for the
   technological advances in telecommunication over recent decades as part
   of a first step to joining a galactic community. The Network offers
   Gary eternal youth if he becomes a simulant, but he refuses. Along with
   Andy and Steven, who has survived, Gary gets into a foul-mouthed debate
   with the Network, calling out the tyranny in the latter's plan and
   demanding that humanity be left to its own devices. Eventually, the
   Network, exasperated, abandons the invasion; the departure triggers an
   electromagnetic pulse. Sam comes back to rescue the remaining humans
   and manages to head for the hills before the town is destroyed, though
   they are unable to escape the pulse that deactivates her car.

   Some time later, the departure of the Network has triggered a worldwide
   blackout that destroyed all electrical power on Earth, sending humanity
   back to the Dark Ages. The remaining simulants have reactivated,
   achieving independence from the Network, but are mistrusted and shunned
   by most of the surviving humans. Andy's marriage has recovered, Steven
   is in a relationship with Sam, and the simulant versions of Peter and
   Oliver have assumed a semblance of their former selves. In the ruins of
   Newton Haven, the now-sober Gary enters a pub with the simulant
   versions of his younger friends and orders water. When the bartender
   refuses to serve simulants, Gary leads his new friends into a brawl.
