   Shikari in Galveston takes place in Texas a century after a meteor
   shower devastated North America and Europe in 1878. The disaster led to
   the United States collapsing and later causing society in Texas to
   evolved into a mixture of Native American and European society. The
   British Empire, or the Angrezi Raj, has been expanding its influence
   into coastal North America, including Galveston, which is being used as
   a base.

   British cavalry officer Eric King, is assembling a hunting party which
   includes the revenge seeking Sonjuh, who lost her family to the
   cannibals and Robre, a young hunter of the Cross Plains tribe who hopes
   to earn a rare rifle from King. Meanwhile, Russian agents plan to
   incite a tribe of cannibals to destroy the British allied tribes of
   former Texas.
