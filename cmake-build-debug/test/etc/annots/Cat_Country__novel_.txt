   The unnamed first-person narrator's spaceship crash-lands on Mars. His
   companion perishes in the crash, and he is stranded alone on Mars. He
   soon meets the planet's inhabitants, who have the faces of cats but
   otherwise appear human, and is captured by some of these cats and meets
   the leader of the group, called Scorpion, a landlord who owns a
   plantation of "reverie leaves", an addictive drug reminiscent of opium
   that is used by all cats.^[7] The narrator is employed by Scorpion to
   guard his reverie leaves^[8] and eventually learns Felinese and gets
   acquainted with the country and its culture, guided by Scorpion and his
   son Young Scorpion. He encounters many problems in society, including
   ill-treatment of women, lack of hygiene and poor building standards,
   culminating in a visit to a school where a single gunshot makes the
   walls collapse.^[9] The schools give out university diplomas on the
   first day, and the museums are filled with empty rooms as the contents
   have been sold off to foreigners.^[8] The political debate is dominated
   by "brawls", political parties modeled after foreign systems, with the
   currently leading ideology being "Everybody Shareskyism", whose leader
   killed and then replaced the cats' emperor,^[10] and slogans composed
   of pseudo-Russian gibberish.^[11] Many cat people are killed in a
   revolution, and finally the country is invaded by a foreign power. The
   invaders lock up the remaining cat people in a cage, and they end up
   biting each other to death. Some months later, the narrator is rescued
   by a passing French spacecraft.^[8]
