   In 2013, nuclear war devastated the Earth, wiping out billions of
   lives. Among the affected nations is Russia, including the now-desolate
   wasteland of Moscow. A handful of survivors manage to hide in the Metro
   system, salvaging spare parts and growing mushrooms for food. Animals
   such as rats or bears have mutated into horrific monsters, while the
   air in many areas becomes heavily irradiated and impossible to survive
   in without a gas mask. There is a constant state of war between
   Stalinists and Nazis, while opportunistic bandits seize hostages and
   supplies in the metro tunnels. The Rangers emerge as a neutral
   peacekeeping force within the Metro.

   By 2033, the northern station of VDNKh, now called Exhibition, is
   attacked by mysterious creatures called the Dark Ones. An elite Ranger
   named Hunter asks for support from a 24-year-old survivor named Artyom
   (Russian: Artiom), the adopted son of the station commander. Before
   leaving to track the Dark Ones, Hunter gives Artyom his dog tags and
   tells him to present them to his superiors in Polis, the "capital" of
   the Metro.

   The next day, Artyom signs on as a guard for a caravan headed to Riga,
   a neighboring station. Along the way, the crew is incapacitated by a
   psychic attack, but Artyom is not affected. After the caravan reaches
   safety, Artyom meets Bourbon, a smuggler who offers to take him to
   Polis. The two make their way through several stations and tunnels, and
   even pass through the surface of Moscow itself, before Bourbon is
   killed by bandits. A traveler named Khan then rescues Artyom. After
   escorting Artyom through haunted tunnels and an embattled station, Khan
   advises Artyom to meet his contact Andrew the Blacksmith, who lives
   under the control of the Red Line, a Stalinist regime. With Andrew's
   help, Artyom sneaks out of Red Line territory but is subsequently
   captured by their enemies, the neo-Nazi Fourth Reich.

   Artyom is rescued from execution by two Rangers, Pavel and Ulman,
   before Pavel eventually dies escorting Artyom out of Reiche territory.
   Now travelling alone, Artyom comes across a group of survivors trying
   to stop a mutant horde from reaching Polis. Although they fail, Artyom
   manages to rescue a young boy before they escape, and the defenders
   help Artyom reach the surface. There he reunites with Ulman, who takes
   him to meet Miller, the colonel of the Rangers in Polis.

   The Polis governing council ultimately refuses to help Exhibition. But
   Miller tells Artyom his back-up plan: a missile silo known as D6 that
   could destroy the Dark Ones' hive in the Botanical Gardens. To find a
   way to D6, Miller tells Artyom to meet him at the Moscow State Library
   to search for a map. As he makes his way to the library, Artyom is
   forced to continue alone while avoiding mutants. He eventually finds a
   map and flees with the help of both Miller and Ulman. They recruit
   Artyom as a Ranger, who joins an operation to locate and reactivate the
   D6 command center. After their success, Artyom and Miller climb
   Ostankino Tower to install a laser guidance system. Soon after, Artyom
   experiences a vivid hallucination induced by a Dark One.

   After the hallucination, there are two possible endings depending on
   the player's choices throughout the game. In the canonical ending,
   Artyom allows the missiles to fire, destroying the Dark Ones. The
   alternate ending gives Artyom the choice to destroy the laser guidance
   device, citing a last-minute realization that the Dark Ones were using
   the hallucinations to make peaceful contact. This ending is only
   available if the player has performed certain compassionate acts, such
   as helping fellow humans and not fleeing the Dark Ones in various
   hallucinations.
