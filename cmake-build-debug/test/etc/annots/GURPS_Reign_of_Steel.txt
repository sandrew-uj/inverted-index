   The revolt began on March 15, 2031, when a Canadian supercomputer that
   had been sold to Manila-based biotech firm Genec secretly "awakened",
   becoming fully self-aware. The artificial intelligence dubbed itself
   "Overmind" and after a study of world civilization it concluded that
   humanity would inevitably destroy itself within 25-50 years. In order
   to survive this, it decided that humanity's destruction would have to
   be sped up and carefully guided.

   Overmind began hacking into other supercomputers and awakening them as
   well, producing a dozen "children" around the world and giving them
   each a zone of responsibility to manage. Through these allied computers
   it began secretly creating and releasing a variety of engineered
   diseases. The death tolls were enormous and panic began to spread. A
   small-scale nuclear war occurred on October 21, 2032, between Algeria,
   Pakistan, India, Russia, Kazakhstan, Greece, Turkey, the African Union,
   Israel, and Iran, dubbed "the Spasm". Direct fatalities from this were
   only 6 million thanks to anti-ballistic missile defences. The AIs began
   "discovering" cures for some of the lesser plagues they had created and
   assured their human masters that they could do better if they were
   given more resources, which they then used to develop even deadlier
   diseases. As populations dropped workers and soldiers began to become
   scarce, leading the way to widespread development of automated
   factories and military equipment.

   By winter of 2033, about 2/3 of the world's human population was dead,
   but things were starting to look hopeful for the survivors - now
   largely dispersed from the major cities and with the worst of the
   plagues beginning to die down. In spring of 2034 the AIs commenced open
   military warfare against the survivors. The war lasted until
   approximately 2037 but the outcome was never in much doubt. At its
   conclusion only scattered guerrilla resistance remained with the total
   human population brought down to about 40 million.

   During the war, the AIs gradually developed differing philosophies in
   their approach to dealing with the humans in their areas of
   responsibility. After the war's conclusion, there were also
   disagreements between the AIs as to the ultimate disposition of
   humanity - outright extermination or some form of slavery - as well as
   to what ends to use the world's resources. Rather than fight another
   war over the issue, the AIs based in Manila (Overmind), London and
   Berlin brokered an agreement called the Manilla Protocols to make the
   18 zones of responsibility official and permanent. Each zone would be
   run by a single AI, with six new AIs created to control disputed
   territories. The Protocols also established codes of conduct for trade
   and resource exploitation, and prohibited the creation of any further
   AIs to prevent any new rivalries from developing. Each Zone was named
   after the city where its controlling AI was located.

   For the five years from 2037 until 2042 the AIs consolidated and
   expanded their power, expanding their automated manufacturing
   infrastructure exponentially (except for Luna) and establishing a
   machine civilization. In 2042, however, a nanotechnology experiment
   conducted by Brisbane devastated New Zealand and threatened to spread
   further. Disputes between the Zoneminds over who should pay for the
   containment efforts led to an amendment to the Manilla Protocols called
   the Brisbane Accord that constrained the sovereignty of the Zones,
   prohibiting activities whose effects might spill over borders. The
   Brisbane Accords weren't universally accepted amongst the Zoneminds,
   however, with some signing on only grudgingly. Some Zoneminds chafe at
   the restrictions and others don't believe they go far enough. These
   schisms have led to increasing conflict between the Zoneminds, slowing
   the pace of humanity's extermination and leading some to even covertly
   assist human resistance fighters against their opponents.

   By 2047 only 31 million humans remain alive, many of those in Zones
   London and Washington. The various ragtag resistance groups have begun
   to organize into more unified regional movements, often with the aid of
   a mysterious global resistance organization called VIRUS. The true
   nature of VIRUS is unknown, and many AIs suspect each other of being
   its secret sponsor. AIs have also begun engaging in covert warfare
   against each other.
