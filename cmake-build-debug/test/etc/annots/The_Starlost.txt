   Foreseeing the destruction of Earth, humanity builds a
   multi-generational starship called Earthship Ark, 50 miles (80 km) wide
   and 200 miles (320 km) long. The ship contains dozens of biospheres,
   each kilometres across and housing people of different cultures; their
   goal is to find and seed a new world of a distant star. In 2385, more
   than 100 years into the voyage, an unexplained accident occurs, and the
   ship goes into emergency mode, whereby each biosphere is sealed off
   from the others.

   In 2790, 405 years after the accident, Devon (Keir Dullea) a resident
   of Cypress Corners, an agrarian community with a culture resembling
   that of the Amish, discovers that his world is far larger and more
   mysterious than he had realized. Considered an outcast because of his
   questioning of the way things are, especially his refusal to accept the
   arranged marriage of his love Rachel (Gay Rowan) to his friend Garth
   (Robin Ward), Devon finds out that the Cypress Corners elders have been
   deliberately manipulating the local computer terminal, which they call
   "The Voice of The Creator". The congregation pursues Devon for
   attacking the elders and stealing a computer cassette on which they
   have recorded their orders, and its leaders plot to execute him, but
   the elderly Abraham, who also questions the elders, gives Devon a key
   to a dark, mysterious doorway, which Abraham himself is afraid to
   enter. The frightened Devon escapes into the service areas of the ship
   and accesses a computer data station that explains the nature and
   purpose of the Ark and hints at its problems.

   When Devon returns to Cypress Corners to tell his community what he has
   learned, he is put on trial for heresy and condemned to death by
   stoning. Escaping on the night before his execution with the aid of
   Garth, Devon convinces Rachel to come with him, and Garth pursues them.
   When Rachel refuses to return with Garth, he joins her and Devon.
   Eventually they make their way to the ship's bridge, containing the
   skeletal remains of its crew. It is badly damaged and its control
   systems are inoperative. The three discover that the Ark is on a
   collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun, and realize
   that the only way to save the Ark and its passengers is to find the
   backup bridge at the other end of the Ark, and reactivate the
   navigation and propulsion systems.

   Getting to the other end of the Ark, which is potentially hundreds of
   miles away, involves traveling through the many disparate communities
   on the starship -- some of which are hostile to outsiders, and all of
   which have different social customs, belief systems and law enforcement
   practices. Generally, each episode will have Devon, Rachel and Garth
   encountering a new society or group as they work their way through the
   ship. Occasionally, they are aided (or hindered) in their travels by
   the ship's frustrating and only partially functioning computer system
   interface, known as Mu Lambda 165 (portrayed by William Osler, who also
   provided the opening narration for each episode).

   20th Century Fox was involved in the project with Douglas Trumbull as
   executive producer. Science fiction writer and editor Ben Bova was
   brought in as science advisor.
