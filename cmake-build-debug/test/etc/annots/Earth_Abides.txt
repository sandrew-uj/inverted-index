   Earth Abides is a 1949 American post-apocalyptic science fiction novel
   by George R. Stewart. The novel tells the story of the fall of
   civilization from deadly disease and the emergence of a new culture
   with simpler tools. Set in the 1940s in Berkeley, California, the story
   is told by Isherwood Williams, who emerges from isolation in the
   mountains to find almost everyone dead.

   Earth Abides won the inaugural International Fantasy Award in 1951. It
   was included in Locus Magazine's list of best All Time Science Fiction
   in 1987 and 1998 and was a nominee to be entered into the
   Prometheus Hall of Fame. In November 1950, it was adapted for the
   CBS radio program Escape as a two-part drama starring John Dehner.
