   Thomas wakes up in a metal elevator that brings him to the Glade. He
   has no memory of who he is or how he got there. He gradually discovers
   that the Glade is run by two boys: Alby, the leader, and Newt, the
   second-in-charge, who both maintain order by enforcing simple but
   effective rules. The elevator box surfaces from under the ground once
   every week and supplies new food, tools, medicine, and sometimes
   weapons. Every month, a new boy with no memory of anything but his
   first name finds himself in that elevator box.

   The Glade is surrounded by a square of four-mile-high walls made of
   concrete. The walls have openings in them, which slide shut like doors
   every night. Outside the walls is the Maze, a labyrinth of high
   concrete walls covered in ivy that changes every day. The Maze houses
   strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers. Not much is known about
   them. The Gladers are trying to stay alive as well as "solve" the Maze
   by appointing "runners" to run through it as fast as they can while
   they track movements of the walls and try to find an exit to escape.

   One day after Thomas's arrival, a girl, Teresa, is delivered through
   the elevator into the Glade with a note saying "She's the last one.
   Ever." The girl later lapses into a long coma. When Thomas comes to
   visit her, he recognizes her but cannot remember her name until he
   hears her voice in his mind, telling him her name. Teresa then wakes up
   and tells Thomas that they knew each other before they were sent into
   the Glade, revealing their ability to communicate telepathically.

   Minho, the Keeper of the Runners, goes into the Maze with Alby to see
   what they think is their first dead Griever. Alby is stung by the
   creature, and while Minho is trying to help him out of the Maze, Thomas
   runs in to help, just as the doors shut. All three are then stranded in
   the Maze overnight. Minho, believing Alby as good as dead, tells Thomas
   to leave him and look for shelter; Thomas, unwilling to abandon Alby,
   instead climbs the vines on the walls to evade the Grievers, then
   attract their attention while staying hidden. Minho uses this tactic to
   kill the four Grievers by chasing them over the Cliff. Thomas, Alby,
   and Minho are the first people in the Glade to survive a night in the
   maze.

   After returning to the Glade the next morning, Newt calls a Gathering
   of the Keepers to discuss what to do with Thomas. Some of the Keepers
   vote to relieve him of punishment, but others, especially Gally, vote
   to lock him up in the Slammer, the jail block, as a punishment. Minho,
   however, nominates Thomas to replace him as the Keeper of The Runners,
   although he later reveals that he did this to make the idea of naming
   Thomas a Runner less ambitious. Gally decides to kick Minho off The
   Council, causing Minho to attack him. Thomas is locked up in jail and
   becomes a Runner and, the next day, starts his training with Minho.

   After their miraculous return, Teresa's arrival triggers a series of
   changes to life in the Glade. People start acting strangely, the sun
   disappears, the weekly deliveries of supplies stop coming, and the
   doors of the Maze stay open at night, which allows the Grievers to
   enter the Glade and to hunt the teens.

   Thomas eventually proposes that the walls of the Maze are not random,
   but that their movements are actually a code, which leads to the
   discovery that the Maze is spelling out words. Thomas also discovers
   that what they previously thought was the Cliff is actually the exit
   used by the Grievers to leave the Maze ("The Griever Hole"). That
   drives Thomas to think that they need memories to get out, leading him
   to intentionally get stung by a Griever so that he can receive the
   antidote ("Grief Serum") and go through the Changing. It is known that
   the Changing can trigger memories and sometimes violence.

   After Thomas and the Gladers discover the pattern, the Gladers decide
   to make a run for the exit. They succeed, only to find out that they
   were test subjects in an experiment conducted by the organization World
   In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department (WICKED). The teenagers
   escape to a laboratory but encounter Gally, who did not escape with
   them. Acting under mind control, he moves to throw a knife at Thomas,
   but a young Glader, Chuck, jumps in the way and is subsequently killed.

   After briefly mourning Chuck's death, all 20 Gladers are rescued and
   brought to a safe haven. There, they are informed about catastrophic
   solar flares that caused an apocalyptic event, followed by a virus, the
   Flare, which killed millions. The rescuers reveal that the Gladers are
   among the orphaned children being tested to find a cure for the virus.

   The epilogue is written in the voice of Chancellor Ava Paige, a feature
   of all the trilogy's novels. She reveals that the group that rescued
   the Gladers may just be another variable in the experiment and that the
   Gladers were not the only group being evaluated. This leads directly
   into the events of the next book.
