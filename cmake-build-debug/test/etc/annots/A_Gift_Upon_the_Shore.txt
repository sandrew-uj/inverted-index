   Set in the near future, A Gift traces the first generations to survive
   nuclear war and its aftermath. Writer Mary Hope and painter Rachel
   Morrow scratch out a meager existence on a farm called Amarna on the
   Oregon coast. They are determined to collect and preserve for a new
   civilization all the great books of western culture. Farther down the
   coast lives the Arkites, a fundamentalist group that denies all
   knowledge not found in the Bible. After a plague strikes the Arkites
   Mary agrees to take in a few survivors on the condition that she be
   allowed to educate the children as she sees fit.
