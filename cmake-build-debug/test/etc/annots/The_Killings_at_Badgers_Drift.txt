   In the fictional village of Badger's Drift, the elderly Miss Bellringer
   insists that her friend, Emily Simpson, did not die of a heart attack
   as her doctor claims, but was in fact murdered. An autopsy soon proves
   her right, as a mix of red wine and hemlock is found in the dead
   woman's system. While the village descends into panic, the murderer
   strikes again, claiming the lives of Dennis Rainbird, a local
   undertaker and his mother Iris Rainbird. As Barnaby investigates, aided
   by Sergeant Gavin Troy, he uncovers a connection between an older crime
   and the current killings at Badger's Drift.
