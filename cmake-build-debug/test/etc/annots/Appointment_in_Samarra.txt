   The novel describes how, over the course of three days, Julian English
   destroys himself with a series of impulsive acts, culminating in
   suicide. O'Hara never gives any obvious cause or explanation for his
   behavior, which is apparently predestined by his character. Facts about
   Julian gradually emerge throughout the novel. He is about thirty years
   old. He is college-educated, owns a well-established Cadillac
   dealership, and within the Gibbsville community belongs to the
   prestigious "Lantenengo Street crowd."

   Our introduction to him comes seven pages into the novel, in the
   thoughts of the wife of one of his employees: "She wouldn't trade her
   life for Caroline English's, not if you paid her. She wondered if
   Julian and Caroline were having another one of their battle royales".
   Within the three-day time span of the novel, Julian gets drunk several
   times. One lyrical long paragraph describes one of his hangovers.
   During the first of two suicidal reveries, we learn that his greatest
   fear is that he will eventually lose his wife to another man. Yet
   within three days, he sexually propositions two women, succeeding once,
   with an ease and confidence that suggest that this is well-practiced
   behavior.

   On successive days, he commits three impulsive acts, which are serious
   enough to damage his reputation, his business, and his relationship
   with his wife. First, he throws a drink in the face of Harry Reilly, a
   man who, we learn later, is an important investor in his business. The
   man is a sufficiently well-known Catholic that Julian knows word will
   spread among the Gibbsville Catholic community, many of whom are his
   customers.

   In a curious device, repeated for each of the incidents, the omniscient
   narrator never actually shows us the details of the incident. He shows
   us Julian fantasizing in great detail about throwing the drink; but, we
   are told, "he knew he would not throw the drink" because he was in
   financial debt to Harry and because "people would say he was sore
   because Reilly...was elaborately attentive to Caroline English". The
   narrator's vision shifts elsewhere, and several pages later we are
   surprised to hear a character report "Jeezozz H. Kee-rist! Julian
   English just threw a highball in Harry Reilly's face!"

   The second event occurs at a roadhouse, where Julian goes with his wife
   and some friends. Julian gets drunk and invites a provocatively clad
   woman to go out to his car with him. The woman is, in fact, a
   gangster's girlfriend, and one of the gangster's men is present, sent
   to watch her. Both Julian's wife and the gangster's aide see the couple
   leave. What actually happens in the car is left ambiguous but is
   unimportant, since all observers assume that a sexual encounter has
   occurred. There is not any assumption that violence will ensue.
   However, the gangster is a valued automobile customer who in the past
   has recommended Julian's dealership to his acquaintances. As Julian is
   driven home, pretending to be asleep, he "felt the tremendous
   excitement, the great thrilling lump in the chest and abdomen that
   comes before the administering of an unknown, well-deserved punishment.
   He knew he was in for it."

   Third, the next day, during lunch at the Gibbsville Club, Julian
   engages in a complicated brawl with a one-armed war veteran named
   Froggy Ogden, who is also Caroline's cousin. Julian thought of Froggy
   as an old friend, but Froggy acknowledges to Julian that he has always
   detested him and had not wanted his cousin Caroline to marry him. In
   the brawl, which Froggy has arguably started, Julian hits Froggy and at
   least one of a group of bystanders in the club.

   He experiences two suicidal daydreams that oddly contrast with each
   other. In the first of the two scenes, after Caroline's temporary
   departure, he places a gun in his mouth:

     Julian thought and thought about Caroline and Harry, and thought
     against them, against their being drawn to each other sexually,
     which was the big thing that mattered. "By God, no one else will
     have her in bed," he said, to the empty office. And immediately
     began the worst fear he had ever known that this day, this week,
     this minute, next year, sometime she would open herself to another
     man and close herself around him. Oh, if she did that it would be
     forever.

   He does not, however, commit suicide at that time. His second suicidal
   reverie is after a failed attempt to seduce a woman, the local society
   reporter. He believes that as a result of his behavior, and the
   community's sympathy for Caroline, "no girl in Gibbsville--worth
   having--would risk the loss of reputation which would be her punishment
   for getting herself identified with him". He believes that even if he
   divorces Caroline he is destined to spend the rest of his life hearing:

     No, let's not have him, he's one of the older guys. Wish Julian
     English would act his age...No thanks, Julian, I'd rather walk. No
     thanks, Mr. English, I haven't much farther to go. Julian, I wish
     you wouldn't call me so much. My father gets furious. You better
     leave me at the corner becuss if my old man. Listen, you, leave my
     sister alone.

   After this and other indications that he had mis-gauged his social
   status, he commits suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, running his
   car in a closed garage.
