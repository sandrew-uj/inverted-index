   As usual for him, Burroughs begins with a frame story that explains how
   he (Burroughs) came into possession of the text. At the end of the
   first book, A Princess of Mars, John Carter was unwillingly transported
   back to Earth. The story proper begins with his arrival back on Barsoom
   (Mars) after a ten-year separation with Dejah Thoris, their unborn
   child, and the Red Martian people of the nation of Helium, whom he has
   adopted as his own. Unfortunately, Carter materializes in the one place
   on Barsoom from which nobody is allowed to depart: the Valley Dor,
   which is the Barsoomian afterlife.

   1928 published by Ladislav Sotek, Prague.

   After John Carter's arrival, a boat of Green Martians on the River Iss
   are ambushed by the previously unknown Plant Men. The lone survivor is
   his friend Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of Thark, who has taken the
   pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find Carter. Having saved their own
   lives, Carter and Tars Tarkas discover that the Therns, a white-skinned
   race of self-proclaimed gods, have for eons deceived the Barsoomians
   elsewhere with the lie that the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor is a
   journey to paradise. Most arrivals are killed by the beasts who dwell
   here, and the survivors enslaved or eaten by Therns.

   Carter and Tars Tarkas rescue Thuvia, a slave girl, and attempt to
   escape, capitalizing on the confusion caused by an attack by the Black
   Pirates of Barsoom upon the Therns. During the attack, Tars Tarkas and
   Thuvia hijack a Black Pirate flier, while Carter fights his way aboard
   another, killing all but one of the Pirates, and rescuing a captive
   Thern princess. From the captured Pirate Xodar, Carter learns that the
   Black Pirates, called the "First Born", also think of themselves as
   gods, and accordingly prey upon the Therns; and additionally identifies
   the captive Thern as Phaidor, daughter of the "Holy Hekkador" (high
   priest) of the Therns. When their flier is recaptured by the First Born
   and taken to their underground realm of Omean, Carter is taken before
   Issus, the self-proclaimed goddess of Barsoom, who dictates the Therns
   through secret communications which they mistake for divine revelation.

   Issus takes Phaidor as a handmaiden for one Martian year; whereas
   Carter is imprisoned, with Xodar as his slave as punishment for being
   defeated by Carter. Thereafter Carter treats him with honor, and thus
   gains his friendship. In prison, they encounter a young man later
   identified as Carter's son Carthoris, with whom Carter is taken to a
   series of games wherein the previous year's handmaidens are killed and
   later eaten by Issus and her nobles. Carter leads a revolt of the
   prisoners, killing many of the First Born; and upon the suppression of
   their revolt, he and Carthoris escape via tunnels, and give themselves
   to guards unacquainted with the revolt to be returned to their prison.
   Upon hearing of the revolt, Xodar rejects Issus' divinity and joins the
   others in escape. Upon later abandoning their aircraft, they encounter
   Thuvia, who describes the capture of Tars Tarkas by the green warriors
   of Warhoon (a clan rival to his own). Carter goes to rescue Tars
   Tarkas, but is discovered by his enemies. After a chase, Thuvia is sent
   on alone, mounted, while the men attempt a stand against the Warhoons.
   They are rescued by the Heliumetic navy but do not find Thuvia.
   Commanding one of the warships is Carter's friend Kantos Kan but the
   fleet is commanded by Zat Arras, a Jed (chieftain) of the hostile
   client state of Zodanga, and Carter is suspected of returning from the
   Valley of Dor, which is punishable by death. Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of
   Helium, and Mors Kajak, the Jed of Hastor (the grandfather and father,
   respectively, of Dejah Thoris, and thus Carter's in-laws) are absent
   from Helium, having led fleets in search of Carthoris. Later, Carter
   discovers that Dejah Thoris may have taken the pilgrimage to the Valley
   Dor to find him.

   Upon returning to Helium, Carter is tried for heresy by the Zodangans;
   but the people of Helium do not tolerate this. Zat Arras imprisons
   Carter after he refuses Zat Arras' offer of freedom in exchange for
   endorsing Zat Arras as Jeddak of Helium, and is imprisoned for 365 days
   until his son frees him. Thereafter he goes to rescue Dejah Thoris with
   a fleet of 1,000 mighty battleships, 5,000 ten-man cruisers, 10,000
   five-man scouting craft, and 100,000 one-man scouts, along with 900
   large troopships and their escorts carrying 250,000 Green Martian
   warriors, all of which is manned by a million Heliumetic fighting men.

   Near Omean, Carter is challenged first by the Therns with a fleet of
   thousands of battleships. Carter sends ten battleships to guard against
   the fleet of the First Born. He then lands 100,000 Green Martian
   warriors to attack the home of the Holy Therns and engages the Thern
   fleet. After the Green warriors dealt the Therns a heavy loss, Carter
   orders the Green warriors to embark back onto their transports, for the
   fleet had spotted another enemy fleet of 5,000 ships commanded by Zat
   Arras. Upon sighting of Zat Arras' fleet, the Therns resumed firing.
   Carter's fleet again engaged the Thern fleet and landed the Green
   warriors with orders to ravage the Therns even more fiercely.

   While Carter was fighting the Therns, the ten battleships he sent to
   guard against the First Born were spotted to be retreating. For a
   moment, Carter allows himself to despair before joining his men in
   fighting. After taking a Thern ship, he joins Kantos Kan, who sprang
   his coup. Onboard Zat Arras' fleet, the Helimetic crews rose up against
   the Zodangan soldiery and took control of every ship in Zat Arras'
   fleet, with the exception of his flagship. Carter led a boarding party
   onto Zat Arras' flagship, and overwhelmed the Zodangan troops. Zat
   Arras threw himself overboard to his death after being ordered to
   surrender by Carter.

   After seeing that the warships of the Therns and the First Born fought
   whenever they encountered each other, he ordered his Heliumetic ships
   to disengage and withdraw to the southwest of the battle. He also
   ordered the Green warriors to embark back onto their transports and for
   those transports to join the main fleet. Carter gave Xodar command of
   5,000 battleships and the transports and sent him directly to the
   Temple of Issus, with orders to land in the garden of Issus or the
   surrounding plain. Carter, Carthoris, and Kantos Kan would lead the
   rest of the fleet (500 ships) to Omean, to attack through the pits
   under the temple. They captured a First Born submarine commanded by
   Yersted, who tells Carter that Dejah Thoris is still alive. Before,
   Carter had given her up as dead, before Yersted's information made him
   realize that a Mars year is 687 days, rather than the 365 days of an
   Earth year. From his force, Carter assembled a force of 5,000 men, to
   be led by Carthoris through the pits under the Temple of Issus.

   However, the tunnels were being slowly flooded, due the pumps of Omean
   having been stopped. During the march, the water had risen to such a
   level that Carter was forced to call a portion of the troops to enter a
   diverging tunnel. Of the 3,000 troops (30 utans) that obeyed Carter,
   most escaped. Casualties were minimal. However, during the march, a
   chemical fire was started in the tunnel they were marching in,
   presumably by the First Born. Carter ordered some 2,000 troops up
   another tunnel. He doubled back to the flames to make sure that no
   soldier had been left behind. However, when he turned back to follow
   his men, he found a massive steel grating blocking the tunnel path.
   Before long, the smoke grew so intense that he was forced to go back
   down the tunnel in hopes of an easier death by drowning. However, he
   managed to escape through yet another tunnel, which led him directly to
   Dejah Thoris. He hid her in the pits from which he had just emerged,
   and went to find his men. He found himself in a chamber in which 500
   men, both Red Martians and First Born, fought to the death. With the
   addition of Carter, the black lines broke and the First Born warriors
   ran. The men in the chamber also witnessed the charge of the Green
   warriors, which broke the thin black line defending the garden. Leading
   the survivors of the red force, guided by Carthoris, he went back to
   the pits where he hid Dejah Thoris. Finding her gone, Carthoris led him
   to Issus' chamber. Carter took her prisoner, and during the standoff, a
   full thousand red men broke into the chamber. Issus went insane, and
   during her mad rant, she told Carter that Dejah Thoris, Thuvia, and
   Phaidor are imprisoned in the Temple of the Sun, each of whose rooms
   opens only once per year. Issus put them there specifically to spite
   Carter, as Issus was aware that all three were in love with him. Carter
   and his men scramble to find the keys to their cell in time, but are
   unsuccessful. Immediately before their room closes, Phaidor attempts to
   kill Dejah Thoris, and her success or failure are left unknown. (The
   story is continued in the third book, Martian series, The Warlord of
   Mars.)
