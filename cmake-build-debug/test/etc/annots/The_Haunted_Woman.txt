   Isabel Loment, engaged to the ordinary and unexceptional Marshall
   Stokes, leads a peripatetic existence as the ward of her aunt, Ann
   Moor. Their travels take them to the downlands of Sussex, to Runhill
   Court, an ancient home owned by Henry Judge. There Isabel discovers a
   strange staircase few can see, which leads upwards to three doors. She
   chooses one, which opens onto a room that appears to exist only part of
   the time; what might lie behind the other doors remains a mystery. In
   the room she reencounters Judge. There they find new insights and are
   able to express themselves in new ways, but are unable to recall what
   has transpired there when they leave. They develop a disturbing
   parallel relationship in the mysterious room, which ultimately
   culminates in the death of Judge and the rupture of Isabel from
   Marshall.
