   The story begins with the catastrophic failure of an elevator which
   Watson had inspected just days before, leading to suspicion cast upon
   both herself and the Intuitionist school as a whole. To cope with the
   inspectorate, the corporate elevator establishment, and other looming
   elements, she must return to her intellectual roots, the texts (both
   known and lost) of the founder of the school, to try to reconstruct
   what is happening around her.

   In the course of her search, she discovers the central idea of the
   founder of Intuitionism - that of the "black box", the perfect
   elevator, which will deliver the people to the city of the future.
