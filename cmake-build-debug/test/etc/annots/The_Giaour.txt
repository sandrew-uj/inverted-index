   Byron was inspired to write the poem during his Grand Tour during 1810
   and 1811, which he undertook with his friend John Cam Hobhouse. While
   in Athens, he became aware of the Turkish custom of throwing a woman
   found guilty of adultery into the sea wrapped in a sack.

   "Giaour" (Turkish: Gavur) is an offensive Turkish word for infidel or
   non-believer, and is similar to the Arabic word "kafir". The story is
   subtitled "A Fragment of a Turkish Tale", and is Byron's only
   fragmentary narrative poem. Byron designed the story with three
   narrators giving their individual point of view about the series of
   events. The main story is of Leila, a member of her master Hassan's
   harem, who loves the giaour and is killed by being drowned in the sea
   by Hassan. In revenge, the giaour kills Hassan and then enters a
   monastery due to his remorse.

   The design of the story allows for contrast between Christian and
   Muslim perceptions of love, death, and the afterlife.

   The poem was written after Byron had become famous overnight after the
   publication of the first two cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage and
   reflects his disenchantment with fame. It also reflects the gloom,
   remorse, and lust of two illicit love affairs, one with his half-sister
   Augusta Leigh and the other with Lady Frances Webster.

   The earliest version of the poem was written between September 1812 and
   March 1813, and a version of 700 lines published in June 1813. Several
   more editions were published before the end of 1813, each longer than
   the last. The last edition contains 1,300 lines, almost twice as many
   as the version first published.
