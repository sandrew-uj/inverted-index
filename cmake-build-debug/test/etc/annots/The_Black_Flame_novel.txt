   The novel starts several hundred years after most of mankind is wiped
   out by a plague and tells the story of a family of immortals who seek
   to conquer the world with advanced science. Its story concerns a
   brother and sister who have become immortal. In "Dawn of the Flame" the
   sister, Margaret of Urbs, known as "Black Margot", is a
   Joan-of-Arc-type, leading the battle against the mutated of mankind. By
   the time of "The Black Flame", she is jaded and finds that being an
   immortal can be boring.
