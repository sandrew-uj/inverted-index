   In 2068, Leave, a powerful android, is created by the Brain Computer
   and raised by the human scientist Fenrir to be the new root of mankind;
   the "Goddess", deciding that the previous human beings are no longer
   useful, wipes them out and creates four "mothers", each one in charge
   of a different quarter of the world, and a new race of androids, the
   Selenoids, classified in castes depending on their strength.

   Ash Ramy is one of the few human survivors, member of the Revolutional
   Organization; after killing a high-ranking Selenoid, he escapes with
   the help of Lemiu Winslet, one of the lower ranking Selenoids, who
   joins his fight against the new Goddess.
