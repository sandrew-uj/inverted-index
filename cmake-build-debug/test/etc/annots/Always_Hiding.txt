   The main protagonist in Romero's novel is Violetta Rosario "Viola"
   Dananay. Viola narrates her life in the Philippines and her eventual
   move to the United States. Viola was conceived before the marriage of
   her parents who belong to Manila's socialite class. Viola grew up in
   Manila during the regime of former Philippine president Ferdinand
   Marcos. Her life was complicated by her quarrelsome parents. One of the
   main reasons for the disagreements between Viola's parents was her
   father's reputation as a womanizer and philanderer. Viola's father left
   the family to live with a pregnant mistress. Viola's mother, Ludy, left
   for the United States to escape the indiscretions of her husband,
   leaving Viola behind. Upon arrival in America, Viola's mother became an
   undocumented immigrant working as a maid in New York City. After the
   fall of the Marcoses, Viola's father was implicated in charges of
   corruption committed by the Marcos government. Viola's father decided
   to send Viola, already a teenager, to the United States to live with
   her mother. Viola obeyed her father but with a "secret agenda":
   to return to the Philippines together with her mother.
