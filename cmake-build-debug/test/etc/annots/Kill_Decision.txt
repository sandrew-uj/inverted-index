   The book opens with a video feed from predator drones in Karbala, Iraq,
   where it is observed that an unmarked drone with American colors fires
   a missile on the dense crowd during a religious ceremony, killing many
   people. Repercussions of this attack are felt worldwide.

   A team at the vision lab in Stanford are informed by a patent lawyer
   that their computer vision code has been stolen by some people and
   appears in public forums. One of the students then traces the code, and
   observes that it initially appeared in a location in China. Just as
   they assemble the team to discuss this development, they are killed by
   a laser guided missile.

   Linda McKinney is studying the swarming behavior of weaver ants in
   Africa. Later that night, Linda is woken up by some noises, and is
   lured away from her house just as her house is completely destroyed in
   a missile attack. She is then sedated and kidnapped by Odin and his
   crew. On the way back to the US, we observe a military operation in
   Pakistan to reverse engineer US predator drones. Odin realizes that it
   is a farce put up to implicate Pakistan for the attack at Karbala, and
   decides to stick to his original plan. They land in Kansas City, and
   then make their way to the base of operations, which is located in
   SubTropolis, an old limestone mine.

   Linda manages to escape the base in a Fire truck. She seeks protection
   of the FBI from the people who have 'kidnapped' her. Ritter, claiming
   to be from the Department of Homeland Security turns up and takes her
   into custody. Ritter is unable to convince Odin to step down on his
   mission to prevent the widespread adoption of unmanned kill-drones.
   Odin takes charge of Linda again. Odin realizes that his base of
   operations has been compromised. They execute their mission quickly,
   which is to capture one of the automated drones in Northern Utah. They
   manage to capture a drone just before it self-destructs, but then their
   plane is targeted by missiles. The teams jumps off with parachutes and
   lands safely. Odin and Linda make their way to another base in
   Colorado. Soon after they land, they find that their communication has
   been tapped. Suddenly, Hoov is killed by a sniper, and they are
   attacked by many automated drones. The team barely manages to escape in
   a plane, but sustains many injuries in the process.

   Odin and their team take sanctuary in Mexico, where they meet up with
   Mouse. Linda and Odin fall in love with each other. They sneak back
   into the US, and then they meet up with Mordecai, who tells them about
   Henry Clarke. Odin infiltrates Henry Clarke's workspace, and
   intimidates him and his superior, Marta into giving him information
   about the location of the pheromone making site, which is in Pakistan.
   The team reach Pakistan and find that a very large shipment of
   pheromone-making chemicals was indeed shipped there, but most of it has
   been processed and shipped off. They also find evidence of larger
   drones that can perform specialized tasks.

   They go to a shipyard in China where they inspect shipping boxes. They
   discover that a large shipment of drones have been transported via the
   ship Ebba Maersk, in a path that will intercept an American navy ship.
   The complete destruction of the ship by the drones will probably
   convince the government to fund the companies building the drones. Odin
   is temporarily stopped by Ritter, but they manage to take Ritter into
   custody. They try to fly a helicopter towards the Ebba Maersk, but find
   that their fuel is probably insufficient to reach it. They land on a
   ship carrying BMW cars, Tonsberg, and hijack it. They release the crew
   of the ship, but convince the captain that to help them.

   Linda proposes a plan of spraying themselves with pheromones so that
   the drones think of them as friendly entities. Using this as a cover,
   Odin, Foxy and Linda manage to land on the Ebba Maersk and maneuver the
   ship away from the navy ship and towards a rocky island. Just as they
   are about to escape, their supply of friendly pheromones runs out. Odin
   creates a diversion by throwing a canister of attack pheromones on the
   opposite side of the ship, and they make it out safely. The team
   returns to the United States, and are commended for their actions by
   their superior. Linda meets her father, and introduces Odin to him.
   Henry quits his job just as Marta's car is hit by a missile.
