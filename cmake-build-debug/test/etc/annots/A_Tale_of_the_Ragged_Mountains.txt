   Set in late November 1827, the tale is begun by an unidentified
   narrator whose story is the loose outer frame for the central tale of
   Augustus Bedloe, a wealthy young invalid whom the narrator has known
   "casually" for eighteen years yet who still remains an enigma. Because
   of ongoing problems with neuralgia, Bedloe has retained the exclusive
   services of 70-year-old physician Dr. Templeton, a devotee of Franz
   Mesmer and the doctrine of animal magnetism, also called "mesmerism".

   Augustus Bedloe had met the doctor previously at Saratoga where Bedloe
   seemed to benefit from Templeton's ministrations. They most likely met
   in a medical context at the Saratoga mineral springs.

   The unidentified narrator recites the tale as told by Bedloe, delivered
   after his late return from one of his customary long rambles in the
   Ragged Mountains, "the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward
   and southward of Charlottesville". At 9:00 that morning, after a
   breakfast of strong coffee and morphine for the pain of his neuralgia,
   Bedloe leaves Charlottesville and heads towards the Ragged Mountains.
   About an hour later, he enters a gorge of "absolutely virgin" solitude,
   filled with a "thick and peculiar mist" in which the visual beauty of
   his surroundings stands out to him in delightful brilliance as the
   morphine takes effect.

   Soon, Bedloe hears unexpected drumming and a metallic rattling sound
   after which he is startled when "a dusky-visaged and half-naked man
   rushed past... with a shriek" followed by a hyena. Stupefied by this
   bizarre encounter, Bedloe sits beneath a tree and suddenly notices that
   its shadow is that of a palm tree not native to Virginia. In "perfect
   command" of his senses, Bedloe notices a strange odor on the breeze and
   hears a low murmur after which a wind clears the fog and he sees "an
   Eastern-looking city, such as we read of in the Arabian Tales" later
   identified by Dr. Templeton as Benares. Bedloe descends into the city
   and eventually finds himself barricaded in a kiosk with British
   officers as a battle rages. In the fighting Bedloe is killed by an
   arrow shaped like "the writhing creese of the Malay" that strikes him
   in the temple.

   As Bedloe recounts his inexplicable journey and return, Dr. Templeton
   strangely seems to know the story already. When the unnamed narrator
   challenges Bedloe's claim of death, the odd rapport between the doctor
   and the patient becomes evident as Bedloe trembles in pale silence
   while Templeton stares with bulging eyes and chattering teeth.

   Bedloe then describes the physical and mental experiences of
   disembodiment and re-embodiment punctuated by distinct galvanic shocks,
   on his return from Calcutta to the Ragged Mountains. Though Bedloe
   cannot ultimately dismiss his adventure as a dream, the story concludes
   ambiguously leaving us with suggestions that either the power of Dr.
   Templeton's writing caused Bedloe's disembodied time-travel experience
   or that Bedloe is the reincarnation of Templeton's friend Oldeb who
   died in 1780 fighting alongside Warren Hastings and a group of British
   soldiers and sepoys during the insurrection of Chait Singh.

   The story ends with Bedloe's death by the accidental application of a
   poisonous "sangsue" (sanguisuge) or leech to relieve a "great
   determination of blood to the head". The narrator completes the tale
   with a note of astonished perplexity upon reading the obituary and
   finding Bedloe's name accidentally spelled without the "e", making
   "Bedlo" the perfect reverse of "Oldeb".
