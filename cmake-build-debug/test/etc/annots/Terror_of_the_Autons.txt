   The Master arrives on Earth and steals the sole surviving Nestene
   energy unit from the National Space Museum. He then hijacks the Beacon
   Hill radio telescope, which he uses as a bridgehead to channel energy
   into the Nestene unit, and kidnaps Professor Phillips, a Ministry of
   Technology research scientist. Reports of the theft and sabotage bring
   the Doctor, his new assistant Jo Grant and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart
   to investigate. At Beacon Hill the Doctor encounters a fellow Time
   Lord, who warns him that an "old acquaintance" is on Earth and will
   certainly try to kill him. The Doctor then identifies and successfully
   neutralises the boobytrap which the Master has left behind.

   Meanwhile, the Master takes over Farrel Autoplastics, a nearby plastics
   factory, to build Autons. Jo, investigating the factory, is discovered
   by the Master, who hypnotises her and wipes her memory of their
   meeting. He sends her back to UNIT with a booby-trap, a box ostensibly
   containing the stolen energy unit. The Doctor realises she has been
   hypnotised and disposes of the bomb.

   UNIT traces the missing Professor Phillips to Rossini's Circus at
   Tarminster. The Doctor visits the Circus, where he is captured by
   Rossini, but freed by Jo, who has followed him there against orders.
   The Doctor removes something from the Master's TARDIS but is attacked
   by Rossini and his men. Rescued by two policemen, the Doctor becomes
   suspicious and unmasks one of the officers as an Auton.

   Fleeing from the Autons, the Doctor and Jo hide in a quarry until the
   Brigadier and Captain Mike Yates arrive. A firefight breaks out between
   the two soldiers and the Autons, enabling the Doctor's party to escape.
   Meanwhile, a larger group of Autons, disguised in weird Carnival masks,
   are touring the country handing out free plastic daffodils to the
   public. Soon deaths from asphyxiation, shock, and heart failure are
   being reported all across the country.

   The Master, meanwhile, infiltrates UNIT headquarters disguised as a
   telephone engineer, and installs an extra long telephone flex in the
   Doctor's laboratory. At the now-empty plastics factory, the Brigadier
   and the Doctor discover that Farrel, the owner, has chartered a coach.
   They also find a plastic daffodil, and a lurking killer Auton, proving
   the connection between the factory and the Master.

   In the Doctor's lab, as he tries to decode the Nestenes' instructions
   imprinted on the cells of the plastic flower, a radio signal from a
   walkie-talkie accidentally activates it. The daffodil sprays a plastic
   film over Jo's nose and mouth, nearly suffocating her, until the Doctor
   dissolves it with a chemical solvent. The Master makes another attempt
   to kill the Doctor, by calling him on the telephone he installed
   earlier, and using a sonic signalling device to activate the plastic
   telephone cable. The extra-length cable attempts to strangle the
   Doctor, but, thanks to the Brigadier's quick thinking, fails.

   The Master then breaks into UNIT HQ. As a bargaining counter, the
   Doctor reveals that he has possession of the Master's dematerialisation
   circuit, and threatens to destroy it: but he is foiled by the presence
   of Jo, who the Master takes as a hostage. The Master takes both Jo and
   the Doctor to the quarry near the radio telescope, to force the
   Brigadier to abort a planned RAF airstrike on the Autons sheltering
   there. But Farrel, struggling to break free of his hypnosis,
   unexpectedly causes a diversion, and while the Master is busy subduing
   him the Doctor and Jo escape.

   UNIT troops engage the Autons, while the Doctor and the Brigadier
   pursue the Master into the radio telescope's control cabin. The Doctor
   convinces the Master that the Nestenes are so utterly different they
   will not be able to distinguish between him and the humans once they
   arrive. Together, they use the channel opened for the invasion to force
   the Nestene energy back into space, causing the Autons to collapse. The
   Master flees, returning to the coach only to re-emerge, apparently
   surrendering. When he pulls out a gun, Yates shoots him dead, but the
   Doctor peels back a facemask on the body to reveal it is the hypnotised
   Farrel, disguised to look like the Master. The real Master escapes in
   the coach. However, with his dematerialisation circuit in the Doctor's
   hands, the Master is now trapped on Earth.
