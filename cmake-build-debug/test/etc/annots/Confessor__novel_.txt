   Richard Rahl has been captured by an Imperial Order commander, who
   spared his life (under the guise of Ruben Rybnik) to be the point man
   for the commander's Ja'La dh Jin team. Kahlan is also Jagang's
   prisoner, surrounded by special guards who can see her. During
   Richard's imprisonment, he is warned by a cloaked specter that he is
   now a player of the Boxes of Orden. Sister Ulicia is also visited by
   this figure, and is told that the time to open the Boxes has been reset
   to one year from the first day of winter-the day that Nicci set the
   Boxes into motion under Richard's name.

   Rachel is discovered missing from the Keep. That night, the witch woman
   Six enters the Keep and steals the third box of Orden from Nicci and
   Zedd. Zedd discovers the Keep's warning that the Wizard's Keep is dying
   due to the contamination of the chimes, and places a spell to protect
   it from future damage. Zedd, Rikka, and Tom then head to Tamarang to
   remove the spell blocking Richard's gift.

   In an attempt to breach the People's Palace, Jagang orders a massive
   ramp built to reach the plateau, bypassing the natural defenses of the
   Palace. While excavating dirt for the ramp in the Azrith Plains,
   Jagang's diggers stumbled upon the catacombs under the People's Palace,
   which provide a secret entryway. Three Sisters of the Dark enter,
   killing Ann and capturing Nicci, while soldiers are sent into the
   catacombs to prepare an attack. The Sisters of the Dark discover what
   they believe to be the original Book of Counted Shadows in Bandakar.

   Richard, after realizing that Jagang and the Sisters with him would
   recognize him during team inspections and throughout the tournament,
   disguises himself by covering the faces and bodies of his teammates and
   himself with intimidating symbols and parts of spell-forms. His team
   defeats Jagang's team in the tournament final, but Jagang refuses to
   accept his team's loss and invalidates the win twice, leading to a riot
   in the camp, during which Richard and Nicci escape, while Kahlan is
   'rescued' by Samuel. Richard and Nicci, with Adie's help, enters the
   Palace through the catacombs, where Cara and Nathan help them wipe out
   the Order forces hiding there.

   Rachel is lured to Tamarang by Violet, who has drawn a spell around her
   that sets 'ghostie gobblies' to destroy her. Along the way, she is
   given a piece of chalk by Shota, disguised as Rachel's mother, and uses
   this to transfer the spell to Violet. Rachel then restores Richard's
   gift. Shota reappears as Rachel's mother and sends her to deliver a
   message with Gratch to the Mud People. On the way to Tamarang, Zedd,
   Rikka, and Tom are captured by Six, who is in league with Jagang and
   has helped attack D'Haran forces in the Old World.

   Richard is warned by Nicci that he must not reveal his love for Kahlan
   to her, lest Kahlan's lost memories alone fail to be restored, much
   like Richard, in the first book of the series, could not be told before
   finding the way to intimately love a Confessor while being untouched by
   her power. Richard is taught many spells and spell-forms by Nicci
   regarding the Boxes of Orden. He tests his knowledge by helping
   priestess Jillian, who was brought to the Azrith Plains after Jagang's
   men hunted her down in Caska, give the Order's army terrible
   nightmares. Jagang is given particularly nasty dreams, mostly involving
   Nicci. After a demand for surrender by Jagang, Richard then sends
   himself to the Underworld, using Denna as a spirit guide, and retrieves
   everyone's memories of Kahlan. Unfortunately, he is attacked by the
   pursuing beast earlier sent against him. He destroys the beast and
   escapes by releasing Additive Magic into the Underworld, whence he is
   physically projected into a gathering of the Mud People. He is greeted
   by Chase and Rachel, who, with Gratch's help, had told the Mud People
   to hold a gathering to await him. At the Palace, Nathan assumes Richard
   is dead and, acting on Richard's instructions, accepts Jagang's terms
   of surrender, which include surrendering Nicci to Jagang and giving the
   Order's Sisters access to the Garden of Life in order to open the
   boxes.

   Samuel attempts to rape Kahlan; during the struggle, she touches the
   Sword of Truth, which restores her knowledge, but not her memories, of
   being a Confessor and releases her power to take control of him. Samuel
   reveals he is an agent for Six, and that Richard and Kahlan were once
   married. He then dies when she refuses to forgive his attempt against
   her. Richard meets Kahlan on the way to Tamarang, but refuses to answer
   her questions about their marriage, for fear of contaminating the spell
   upon her. He gives her Spirit in compensation.

   Six has imprisoned Zedd, Tom, and Rikka, and appears as Richard and
   Kahlan arrive in Tamarang. As Six is about to recapture them, Shota
   appears as Six's mother. She kills Six and then Richard, Kahlan, and
   Zedd fly back to the People's Palace on the red dragon Six had
   enslaved; now revealed to be Scarlet's son Gregory, whom Richard saved
   as an egg.

   At the Palace, Richard allows Jagang and his Sisters of the Dark to
   open the boxes of Orden. During the ritual, Jagang goes to retrieve
   Nicci from the dungeon. However, Nicci locks a Rada'Han around Jagang's
   neck, rendering him powerless. After taking him back to the Garden of
   Life, she eventually kills him unceremoniously to prevent his
   martyrdom.

   In the Garden of Life, the Sisters of the Dark discover the correct box
   and open it; however, they find a flaw in their success. Richard
   explains that all of the Books of Counted Shadows were false keys to
   the boxes; whereas if they had the true key, they would still fail by
   reason of malicious intent. Immediately, the Sisters are drawn into the
   Underworld.

   Richard explains that the true key to the Magic of Orden is the Sword
   of Truth. Kahlan tells Richard she loves him, revealing that her
   emotions have contaminated her chances of regaining memory. Richard
   uses the Sword to reveal the correct box and then to capture its magic.
   Now in command of life and death, he uses the magic to send the
   followers of the Order to a new world, devoid of magic; his half-sister
   Jennsen, her compatriots the Bandakar, and her suitor Tom decides to
   relocate to the new world. He also uses Orden to repair the damage
   caused by the chimes, and to send Chainfire to the new world he has
   created, ensuring the complete removal of magic from that world, and
   removing all its inhabitants' memories of their previous world. As
   Richard goes to close the opening between worlds, he fears Kahlan is
   lost to him; she, however, replies that she was protected from this
   loss because she had fallen in love with him on her own, much as he had
   with her from the beginning.

   An epilogue shows Tom and Jennsen expecting a child, who will carry the
   Rahl name, and shows the immigrants gradually forgetting Richard and
   everything from their previous world. The book ends with the marriage
   of Cara and General Meiffert. It is revealed that the Sisters of the
   Light have moved into the Wizard's Keep, where along with Zedd, they
   can continue to teach young wizards. Chase (now a Warden of the Keep)
   and his family have also moved into the Keep, as have Adie and
   Friedrich, who are now a mated pair. Under Zedd's questions, Richard
   admits taking Panis Rahl's spell from red fruit, so that it is no
   longer poison, and to bringing back the Temple of the Winds to the
   world of the living. After Cara and Benjamin's wedding, the devotion
   bells begin to ring. Richard prevents the people from kneeling,
   proclaiming that they are no longer his subjects.
