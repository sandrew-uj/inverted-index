   Sick from being drugged, Dane Thorson staggers out of a flophouse on
   the planet Xecho and gets back to his ship, the Free Trader (i.e. tramp
   freighter) Solar Queen, just in time for the ship's blastoff on its
   first mail run to Trewsworld. Once the ship is secured, Dane and the
   crew find a man made up to look like Dane lying dead in Dane's bunk.
   After storing the corpse in a freezer, the crew discovers that part of
   their cargo, creatures called brachs, has become sentient. They find a
   radiation source that seems to be responsible for the change and which
   may have also changed the lathsmer embryos that they are carrying. For
   the nonce, until they can solve the mystery of the dead man and the
   radiation source, they put the brachs and the lathsmers into Solar
   Queen's lifeboat and Dane, astrogator Rip Shannon and engineer Ali
   Kamil land it on Trewsworld away from the starport to wait.

   The usually bird-like lathsmers are hatching and looking more like
   dragons. They manage to escape into the wild and Dane and Ali go
   looking for them. During the hunt, with the male brach assisting with
   his telepathic ability, Dane finds a crawler with the crew murdered and
   robbed of their cargo. Returning to the lifeboat, the two men find
   Medic Tau waiting there with Ranger Wim Meshler, who tells them that
   the crew have all been arrested on a long list of charges, including
   the murder of the dead man they found.

   After explaining the situation to Meshler, the men note that the
   dragon-like lathsmers are still on the loose. Using Meshler's flitter,
   Meshler, Tau, Dane and the brach find the dragons and capture them. As
   they attempt to return to the lifeboat a control beam pulls the flitter
   to an enemy camp. There the men are captured and the flitter destroyed.
   With the aid of the brach, Meshler, Tau, Dane, and the brach escape
   into the night.

   Following a crawler track, they find the enemy's main base with
   monsters, mutated animals, in force-field pens. They also discover that
   they are inside one of the pens and must evade two monsters. The brach
   turns off the force-field, allowing the men to escape but also
   releasing the monsters. The men and the brach steal a flitter and
   escape, flying it to Cartl's holding, a large farmstead where they can
   call the authorities in Trewsport.

   Another holding is being attacked by the released monsters, so Dane,
   Meshler and the brach go to help the evacuation. The enemy brings down
   the flitter, but can't use it, so they plan to use Dane and Meshler as
   bait to draw in a rescue flitter which they can then steal. The rescue
   flitter brings a team of Stellar Patrolmen, Trewsport Police, and the
   rest of Solar Queen's crew and they defeat the crooks.

   Dane guides the rescue party to the crooks' base and the Patrol
   captures it before the crooks' spaceship can blast off. Thus begins the
   unraveling of a galaxy-wide criminal empire. The crew of the Solar
   Queen are allowed to acquire the crooks' spaceship cheaply and they
   will use it for interplanetary cargo runs in the Trewsworld system.
