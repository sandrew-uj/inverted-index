   Tony Hale, skilled engineer and amateur radio ham, smuggles a home-made
   transceiver on board an Earth-orbiting satellite during his tour of
   duty. This proves invaluable as the commander of the satellite,
   Hendriks, is a megalomaniac and demands to be made 'Dictator of the
   World'. To back up this demand, he begins destroying swathes of the
   Earth's surface using a radiation beam. The only secure link between
   the Earth and the satellite is Tony's radio.
