   The game opens in the Southwestern United States in an alternate
   history of the year 1976, in which the 1973 oil crisis was never
   resolved. The corrupt police force is ineffective against rampant
   riots, and the area devolves into lawless chaos. In an attempt to
   maintain order, some citizens turn to vigilantism by outfitting their
   vehicles with armor and weapons. One such vigilante, Jade Champion, is
   found murdered in a junkyard.

   Suspecting foul play and seeking vengeance, fellow vigilante Taurus
   convinces Jade's brother Groove to join him in his investigation.
   Although reluctant, Groove proves himself a talented driver and a
   capable fighter, quickly picking up on the necessary skills to survive
   in battle.

   In the course of their patrols, the two stumble upon a briefcase
   containing a large amount of money, and plans for a nuclear device.
   Taurus deduces that Jade had found out about this as well, attracting
   the ire of higher powers that got her killed. Further investigation
   clues them into spying on the deal to acquire the bomb, during which
   they learn of its intended delivery: an old military fort built on top
   of North America's largest oil reserve.

   Groove storms the fort, fighting against an unexpectedly overwhelming
   opposition that leaves him with no way out. In a desperate maneuver, he
   ramps over the fort's outer wall and crashes into the compound,
   wrecking his car in the process and knocking himself unconscious. Upon
   awakening, he finds himself at the mercy of Antonio Malochio, Jade's
   killer and the mastermind behind the plan. As he arms the nuclear bomb,
   Malochio openly gloats that he has been hired by OPEC to destroy
   America's oil reserve in order to perpetuate the crisis and keep prices
   high.

   Groove taunts Malochio into a duel, accusing him of dishonorably
   killing Jade. Furious, Malochio orders him to pick a car from the
   garage and take him on. Despite fighting an unfair battle that sees
   Malochio's henchmen joining in as reinforcements, Groove emerges
   victorious, leaving Malochio trapped in the remains of his car. As
   Malochio begs for his life, Groove experiences a brief vision of Jade
   in the distance, giving him the resolve to execute Malochio at
   gunpoint, and sate his revenge.
