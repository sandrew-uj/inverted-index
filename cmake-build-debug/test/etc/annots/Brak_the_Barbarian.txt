   Brak, a blond, braided and broadsword-wielding barbarian from the
   frozen north, is an outcast from his people for questioning the
   traditional war gods. He seeks to reach the glorious southern realm of
   Khurdisan the Golden, rumors of which have reached even his country.
   The stories (and indeed the series) deal with Brak's episodic quest as
   he overcomes threat after threat, with the dream of Khurdisan ever
   before him.

   His first stop is the city of Kambda Kai, once great but now afflicted
   by worshipers of the demon god Yob-Haggoth. Here too his religious
   skepticism gets Brak in trouble, immediately bringing him into conflict
   with the corrupt and evil cult. Destined to be sacrificed to the evil
   god, Brak wins free--but the demon worshipers and their foul monsters
   infest all the lands between him and his goal, and in consequence every
   step of his journey brings new challenges.

   There is the evil, soul-taking Septegundus, who promises a dire revenge
   for Brak's humbling of himself and his dark god. Later Brak is enslaved
   at the terrible mines of King Ushiram of Toct and starts a slave
   rebellion; confronts the conjurer Ankhma Ra whose Silk of Shaitan can
   rip the living heart out of anyone it touches; confronts the
   treacherous Zama Khan at the ruins of cursed Chambalor and frees
   thousands of ghosts who had been trapped there in prolonged torment;
   and saves the life and throne of Queen Rhea of Phrixos (after she first
   saved him at considerable risk to herself) averting her enforced
   betrothal to the odious Lord of the Tigers.

   In nearly every episode Brak also confronts a gigantic monster of one
   kind or another--some of them cultivated by human villains, others
   seeking human prey on their own account: The Doomdog, haunting the
   caverns of Toct; the Fangfish, in a deep pool at a sinister mountain
   pass above the realm of Tazim, Lord of the Tilling; T'Muk, The Thing
   Which Crawls, a highly poisonous giant spider at Chambalor's desert;
   and a giant scavenger slug, which in the aftermath of battles at
   Phrixos feeds on dead (and wounded) soldiers.

   Though a most formidable fighter when aroused, Brak is not particularly
   bloodthirsty or aggressive. In most cases, the villains he fights have
   picked a fight with him in the first place (a costly mistake). Nor is
   he especially greedy, several times turning up chances to win great
   treasure. His wants are limited to a few dinshas in his purse, enough
   to buy food, a pony to ride on (several of the poor beasts get killed
   in the course of the book and need replacing) and of course a properly
   sharp broadsword, without which he feels naked.

   Brak acts according to his own strict code of honor. He keeps his word,
   once given, even when knowing his "civilized" interlocutor intends to
   double-cross him at the first opportunity. He has a strong inhibition
   against harming women, even vile women who mock his honor and try their
   worst to harm him. Indeed, in the early episodes Brak encounters an
   entire collection of very nasty women: The demonic immortal witch
   Ariane, who wants his soul; the cruel and sadistic Princess Vian; the
   wanton and corrupt Princess Jardine. In later parts, this is
   counterbalanced by the warm-hearted Dareet, Zama Khan's daughter who
   deplores her father's evil ways, and later Queen Rhea, a veritable
   paragon of virtues.

   Good women or bad, Brak is clearly determined not to settle down in any
   one place, but rather continue on his endless, Quixiotic quest for
   fabled Khurdisan. Even when a young, beautiful and courageous queen is
   deeply in love with him, he firmly if regretfully declines her offer.
   The heartbroken queen, left behind, vows to await his return, for
   decades if need be, and take no other consort--but Brak sets out on
   further wanderings and has many more adventures, detailed in the
   various sequels.
