   The novel takes place in an unspecified year in the near-future (at one
   point said to be in the 1980s, roughly a decade after the novel's
   publication). Human activities have resulted in wholesale destruction
   of the environment.

   Water pollution is so severe that "don't drink" notices are frequently
   issued. Household water filters are popular items. Air pollution has
   reached the point that people in urban areas can't go outside without
   wearing air masks. The fumes left behind by aircraft are such that it
   causes air sickness in planes trailing behind. California is blanketed
   by a thick layer of smog that prevents the sun from shining through.
   Acid rain forces people to cover themselves in plastic so that their
   clothes don't get ruined. The sea has become so polluted and the
   beaches so strewn with garbage, that people now vacation in the
   mountains.

   Coastal waters are mostly covered by a stinky, oily film made up of
   sewage, detergents, industrial effluent, and cellulose microfibers. The
   Mediterranean Sea is poisoned beyond recovery, leading to war, famine,
   and civil unrest in the surrounding countries. The Baltic, Great Lakes,
   and Caspian are also described as being poisoned. The use of defoliants
   and herbicides leads to the Mekong Delta becoming a desert. The heavy
   use of chemicals has made large swathes of farmland unsuitable for
   growing anything, resulting in higher food prices.

   Many animal species and surface sea fish are on the brink of
   extinction, while birds are not as common as before, the Bald Eagle
   having gone extinct. Overuse of antibiotics has made a host of bacteria
   resistant and infectious disease is rampant. Household pests have also
   grown resistant to pesticides and a new type of agricultural pest,
   known as Jigras, causes food shortages.

   The right wing government is indifferent to these problems. The
   President, known as Prexy, can only offer snappy quotes in response to
   various disasters. When poisonings and famine become rampant, the
   government scapegoats Honduran communist rebels and puts the country
   under martial law. They resort to violence and oppression to silence
   their critics.

   References are made to attempts to rein in the environmental
   destruction, but they are depicted as having made no difference to the
   state of the environment. Even so, one Republican Senator claims that
   these regulations are destroying American business.

   Crime and racial and civil unrest is growing. Travel abroad is
   discouraged because of terrorist attacks on planes, while fewer and
   fewer people graduate with science, engineering, or business management
   degrees, as agriculture and food-related degrees are most in-demand and
   most likely to lead to emigration from the U.S.. The number of poor
   people is growing while the shrinking number of the wealthy enclose
   themselves in walled communities guarded by armed mercenaries.

   The US is said to be involved in various foreign wars, similar to
   Vietnam, which was ongoing when the book was published. A conflict in
   Honduras is hampered first by American soldiers coming down with
   enteritis and then by the need to crack down on violence in the United
   States. Many young men flee the draft.

   A growing group of environmentally-conscious activists calling
   themselves "Trainites" - from their hidden leader Austin Train - turn
   slowly to terrorist acts in an attempt to stop the corporations from
   spoiling the Earth. The character of Austin Train is an academic who,
   despite predicting and interpreting social change, has become
   disillusioned by society's failure to listen; this character is used to
   drive the plot, as well as to explain the background story to the
   reader.
