   Clary goes to the Pandemonium club with her best friend, Simon Lewis,
   where she sees a blue-haired boy and a black-haired girl sneak into a
   storeroom, pursued by two other boys; one armed with what appears to be
   a knife. She sends Simon for help and she follows the group into the
   storeroom, where she witnesses the blue-haired "boy" being killed;
   whereupon he vanishes from the room, with the explanation that demons
   "return to their home dimensions when they die." Simon enters the
   storeroom with the bouncer in tow and questions why she is there alone,
   and realizing no one else can see the others, she mumbles an apology.

   When she returns home, her mother, Jocelyn, scolds her for staying out
   so late. The next day, Jocelyn announces that they are moving from New
   York City to the country for the summer where Jocelyn's best friend,
   Luke, has a house. Clary, upset by the unexpected move, confides in
   Simon that she knows almost nothing about her mother or her entire
   family. Simon mentions seeing thin, white scars on Jocelyn's back and
   shoulders, but Clary dismisses this. They go to a poetry reading where
   Clary sees Jace, one of the boys from the previous night, who privately
   tells Clary about demon-hunters, called Shadowhunters or Nephilim, and
   claims Clary is not a mundane (ordinary human). This is because she has
   the Sight, which allows her to see beings from the Shadow World. Clary
   answers a call from Jocelyn, who frantically warns her not to come home
   and to tell Luke that "he" has found her. The call ends abruptly.

   After the failure to phone back, Clary returns to her house and finds
   it in disarray, and her mother gone. She is attacked by another demon,
   which she kills with Jace's Sensor; and Jace brings Clary to the
   "Institute": the local headquarters of the Shadowhunters, where she is
   introduced to two other hunters, Isabelle and Alec, and the tutor,
   Hodge. Since Jace marked Clary with a stele and she was unharmed, this
   proves that Clary has Nephilim blood, as only Nephilim may be touched
   by a stele and unharmed. A stele is a weapon used to kill demons and
   mark Shadowhunters with angelic runes that give them their powers. Jace
   and Clary return to Clary's house and meet her neighbor Madame
   Dorothea, who has a teleportation portal. To find her mother, Clary,
   followed by Jace, rushes through the portal, and they land at Luke's
   bookstore and find Simon, in search of Clary. The three hide inside the
   store. Luke returns with two men, Pangborn and Blackwell, whom
   Valentine sent to interrogate Luke about the Mortal Cup: a talisman
   sought by both parties. Luke claims ignorance of where Jocelyn hid the
   Mortal Cup and refuses to negotiate with them or interfere with
   Valentine's plans.

   Clary and Jace, accompanied by Simon, tell Hodge what they learned, and
   Hodge tells them about the Circle: a group of Shadowhunters that
   Valentine formed to eliminate all Downworlders (vampire, werewolves,
   faeries, warlocks, and others), which Jocelyn, Valentine's wife, joined
   when she was younger. Alongside Jocelyn, Alec and Isabelle's parents
   also used to be Circle Members. As did Luke, who used to be called
   Lucian and was a Shadowhunter and the parabatai of Valentine. A
   parabatai is a sacred bond between two Shadowhunters.

   Clary and Jace go to the Silent City to speak to the Silent Brothers,
   who tell them that a block in her mind prevents her from remembering
   the Shadow World; itself placed by a warlock named Magnus Bane.

   Isabelle meanwhile has been given an invitation to a party hosted by
   Magnus. At the party, Clary meets Magnus, who says his spell is too
   complex to remove but will fade naturally if it is not reinforced every
   two years, and was placed at the behest of Jocelyn for Clary's
   protection. Alec and Magnus bond during this moment. During the party,
   Simon ignores Isabelle's warning and drinks a blue liquid that
   transforms him into a rat. Vampires take him away thinking Simon was
   one of their own, but Clary and Jace rescue him and restore him to
   human form. That night, Jace takes Clary to the Institute's greenhouse
   on a midnight picnic to celebrate Clary's sixteenth birthday, where
   Jace then kisses her.

   As her memories emerge, Clary deduces that the Mortal Cup is hidden in
   one of Madame Dorothea's tarot cards. Clary retrieves the Cup, but the
   demon Abaddon has possessed Madame Dorothea and is disguised as her, as
   he attempts to take it. Aided by Simon, they escape and return to the
   Institute where Hodge hands over the Cup and an unconscious Jace to
   Valentine. Hodge flees, pursued by Clary. Hodge attacks her in an
   alleyway, but she is unexpectedly saved by Luke, who is a werewolf.
   While Luke's werewolf pack attacks Valentine's followers, Clary locates
   her mother, who is unconscious, and also finds Jace, who says Valentine
   identified Jace himself as his son; this dismays both Jace and Clary.
   This means that Jace and Clary, who were attempting to enter into a
   romantic relationship, are brother and sister. Valentine entices Jace
   to return to Idris - the Shadowhunters' home country - with him. Jace
   refuses, and Valentine escapes through a portal with the Cup, smashing
   the portal behind him.
