   The novella tells the story of Hauke Haien, related to the narrator by
   a schoolmaster in a small town in Northern Frisia. Hauke is the son of
   a farmer and licensed surveyor and does his best to learn his father's
   trade. He even learns Dutch so he can read a Dutch print of Euclid's
   work on mathematics and geometry. Over time he becomes very familiar
   with the dykes along the local coast and begins to wonder if it would
   not be better to make them flatter on the sea side so as to reduce
   their windage during floods.

   When local Deichgraf Tede Volkerts fires one of his hands, Hauke
   applies for the job and is accepted. He soon becomes a great help for
   Volkerts, which makes Ole Peters, the senior hand, dislike him.
   Tensions rise even more when Hauke begins to show interest in the
   Deichgraf's daughter, Elke. Hauke even proposes marriage, but she wants
   to wait.

   After the unexpected deaths of both Hauke's and Elke's fathers, the
   people of the village must choose a new Deichgraf. Hauke is actually
   already doing the work, but does not hold the necessary lands required
   for the position. However, Elke announces that they are engaged, and
   that he will soon hold her family's lands as well. With the
   traditionalists satisfied, Hauke becomes the new Deichgraf. However,
   the people soon start talking about his white horse, which they believe
   is a resurrected skeleton that used to be visible on a small island,
   but is now gone.

   Meanwhile Hauke begins to implement the changes to the form of the
   dykes that he has envisaged since childhood. However, during a storm
   surge several years later, the older dykes break and Hauke has to
   witness Elke and their daughter, Wienke, being swept away by the water.
   In agony, he drives his white horse into the sea, yelling, "Lord, take
   me, spare the others!"

   The novella ends with the schoolmaster recounting that after the flood
   the mysterious horse skeleton was once again seen lying on the small
   island off the coast. Hauke Haien's dyke still stands and has saved
   many lives in the hundred years since its creator's tragic demise. And
   the older ones in the village say that, on stormy nights, a ghostly
   rider on a white horse can sometimes be seen patrolling the dyke.
