   In the year 1999 the world is in the midst of an environmental
   holocaust, the result of a series of solar flares which have scorched
   the Earth for the last 30 years. Exposure to the flares results in a
   radiation poisoning which causes the affected to degenerate into
   psychotic killers. The vast majority of the world's population is dead,
   the world is desolate and arid, and in the United States the government
   and military now only control New York City and Washington DC.
   Otherwise, what is left of humanity is divided between militarised
   encampments protecting pockets of the unaffected survivors, and roving
   groups of slavers and scavengers. Unradiated water, gasoline and women
   have become precious resources which the surviving groups hoard
   jealously and are willing to kill to obtain.

   John Travis (Ron Marchini) is the leader of a security patrol for one
   of the compounds led by Prescott (Adam West) when he and his squad are
   sent to investigate reports of a slaver auction of female captives.
   Suspecting that notorious bandit leader Wraith is there, he is ordered
   to break up the auction and kill Wraith if possible. The raid goes
   badly, however, as the group are forced to open fire, resulting in the
   deaths of all of Travis' comrades along with several dozen slavers and
   scavengers. Calling for backup, Travis is told that due to solar flare
   activity he is not only alone but he cannot be allowed back into the
   safety of his home compound. Wraith, learning of the identity of his
   attacker, conducts a ritual sacrifice of a woman and swears before his
   men that the next sacrifice will be of Travis.

   Abandoned in a small urban area, Travis ends up freeing three women,
   who he takes back to an abandoned local baseball stadium which he
   apparently uses as a part-time hide-out. Realizing that the third of
   the women is sick and needs medical attention, he takes the group to a
   clinic run by a friend, Dr. Latimer (Stuart Whitman). While there, he
   is led into a trap by a boy working for Wraith who steals weapons from
   his car. Although he escapes, the three women flee the clinic when the
   doctor reveals that he has been infected by the most recent flare. When
   Travis returns he finds the clinic abandoned save for Dr. Latimer, who
   he is forced to shoot.

   Reuniting with the three women at the baseball field, Travis makes the
   decision to return to the compound and demand medical aid from his
   erstwhile employers. Upon return he finds that Wraith's men already
   have the bunker under siege, and any chance of saving those inside has
   passed. Despite making an attempt at buying some time for the survivors
   inside, Prescott reports that Wraith's men have breached the bunker,
   ransacked its armory and are overrunning it, killing everyone inside.
   Left with no other option, Prescott tells Travis that his one chance to
   kill Wraith is to use the store's explosives to detonate the bunker,
   killing everyone inside. Travis reluctantly agrees, and aided by his
   female companions he clears the exterior of the compound, liberates the
   explosives and levels the facility. From there, he and his companions
   cross the country to live around the untainted mountain lakes of
   Montana.
