   With the world becoming a desert wasteland following a societal
   collapse from warfare over resources, a survivor named Max Rockatansky
   is captured and taken to Immortan Joe's Citadel by the War Boys, an
   army led by Joe. Max is imprisoned and used as a "blood bag" for a sick
   War Boy called Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's
   lieutenants, is sent in her armoured "War Rig" to extract gasoline and
   ammunition. When Joe realises that his five wives are fleeing with her,
   he leads his army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby
   Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.

   Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a battle ensues
   between the War Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into a sand storm,
   evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to
   destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is
   destroyed. After the storm, Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig,
   accompanied by the wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag, and the
   Splendid Angharad, the last of whom is pregnant with Joe's child. Max
   steals the Rig, but reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the wives
   accompany him. Nux boards the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill
   Furiosa, but is overcome and thrown out, being picked up by Joe's army.

   Furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon, having bartered
   a deal for safe passage. The gang turns on her when they discover Joe's
   army arriving, forcing her and the group to flee, while the bikers
   detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight off the
   pursuing bikers as Joe's car breaks through the blockade. Joe catches
   up with the War Rig, allowing Nux to board with the intent of attacking
   Furiosa again; he fails, to the disappointment of Joe. As the Rig
   escapes, Angharad falls off trying to help Max and is fatally run over
   by Joe's car. Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the
   "Green Place", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood.
   Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, and consoles him as he laments his
   failure. Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with mines, but Joe's ally,
   the Bullet Farmer, continues pursuit. After Furiosa shoots the Bullet
   Farmer, Max leaves to confront him and his men, returning with guns and
   ammunition. During the firefight, Nux emerges from hiding to help free
   the trapped Rig and joins the crew.

   After driving the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, the
   crew comes across a mysterious woman. Furiosa approaches her and states
   her history and clan affiliation. The woman summons her clan, the
   Vuvalini, who recognize Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped
   as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they
   passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then
   plans to ride across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new
   home. After seeing visions of a child he failed to save, Max convinces
   them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and
   greenery, and to trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon.

   The group heads back towards the Citadel and engage Joe's forces, with
   many Vuvalini and many of Joe's forces killed, and Furiosa seriously
   wounded. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it,
   while Max fights Joe's large adult son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures
   Toast, who manages to distract him long enough for Furiosa to kill him.
   Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking
   the canyon, allowing the group to escape in Joe's car. Max transfuses
   his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.

   Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joe's death.
   Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the crowd and
   welcomed by the remaining War Boys. Max and Furiosa both share a glance
   before he leaves.
