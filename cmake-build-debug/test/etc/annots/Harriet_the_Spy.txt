   In 1964, eleven-year-old Harriet M. Welsch is an aspiring writer who
   lives in New York City's Upper East Side. Harriet is precocious,
   ambitious and enthusiastic about her future career. Encouraged by her
   nanny, Catherine "Ole Golly," Harriet carefully observes others and
   writes her thoughts down in a notebook as practice for her future
   career, to which she dedicates her life. She follows an afternoon "spy
   route", during which she observes her classmates, friends, and people
   who reside in her neighborhood. One subject that Harriet observes is a
   local store, where the younger son Fabio cannot make anything of his
   career in contrast to the hardworking and loyal Bruno, and where the
   stock boy Joe Curry or "Little Joe" is eating in the storeroom and
   feeding homeless kids instead of working.

   Harriet's best friends are Simon "Sport" Rocque, a serious boy who
   wants to be a CPA or a ball player, and Janie Gibbs, who wants to be a
   scientist. Harriet's enemies in her class are Marion Hawthorne, the
   teacher's pet and self-appointed queen bee of her class, and Marion's
   best friend and second-in-command, Rachel Hennessy.

   Harriet enjoys having structure in her life. For example, she regularly
   eats tomato sandwiches and adamantly refuses to consume other types of
   sandwiches. She also resists "girlie" activities, as when her parents
   expect her to attend dance school and she stubbornly refuses. Ole Golly
   gets Harriet to change her mind on dance school by telling her the
   stories of Josephine Baker and Mata Hari.

   Harriet's life changes abruptly when Ole Golly's suitor, Mr.
   Waldenstein, proposes and she accepts. Mrs. Welsch (who, ironically,
   had threatened to fire her earlier in a fit of panicked rage at finding
   Harriet missing in the middle of the night) exclaims, "You can't leave,
   what will we do without you?" Ole Golly replies that she had planned to
   leave soon anyway, because she believes Harriet is old enough to care
   for herself. Harriet is crushed by the loss of her nanny, to whom she
   was very close. Her mother and father, who have been largely absentee
   parents because of their obligations to work and social life, are at a
   loss to understand Harriet's feelings and are of little comfort to her.

   At school, during a game of tag, Harriet loses her notebook. Her
   classmates find it and are appalled at her brutally honest
   documentation of her opinions of them. For example, in the notebook she
   compares Sport to a "little old woman" for his continual worrying about
   his father, and says that Marion Hawthorne is destined to grow up to be
   a "lady Hitler." The students form a "Spy Catcher Club" in which they
   think up ways to make Harriet's life miserable, such as stealing her
   lunch and passing nasty notes about her in class. When the kids
   orchestrate a prank to spill ink on Harriet and make it look like an
   accident, it backfires when she slaps Marion in revenge, leaving a blue
   hand print on Marion's face.

   Harriet regularly spies on the Spy Catcher Club through a back fence
   and concocts vengeful ways to punish them. She realizes the
   consequences of the mean things she wrote, but because she is hurt and
   lonely, she thinks up special punishments for each member of the club.
   After getting into trouble for carrying out some of her plans, Harriet
   tries to resume her friendship with Sport and Janie as if nothing had
   ever happened, but they both reject her. Harriet stops doing schoolwork
   and spends all her time in class writing in her notebook, making plans
   against the Spy Catcher Club. She skips school for days at a time and
   stays in bed because of depression. When her grades go down, Harriet's
   parents confiscate her notebook, which only depresses her further.

   Harriet's mother takes her daughter to see a psychiatrist, who advises
   Harriet's parents to get in touch with Ole Golly and ask her to write
   to Harriet. In her letter, Ole Golly tells Harriet that if anyone ever
   reads her notebook, "you have to do two things, and you don't like
   either one of them. 1: You have to apologize. 2: You have to lie.
   Otherwise you are going to lose a friend."

   Meanwhile, dissent is rippling through the Spy Catcher Club. Marion and
   Rachel are calling all the shots, and Sport and Janie are tired of
   being bossed around. When they quit the club, most of their classmates
   do the same.

   Harriet's parents speak with her teacher and the headmistress, and
   Harriet is appointed editor of the class newspaper, replacing Marion.
   The newspaper--featuring stories about the people on Harriet's spy
   route and the students' parents--becomes an instant success. Harriet
   also uses the paper to print a retraction of the things she had written
   in her journal. Harriet is forgiven by Sport and Janie.
