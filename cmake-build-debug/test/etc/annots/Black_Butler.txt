   In Victorian-era London lives a thirteen-year-old earl named Ciel
   Phantomhive, who acquired this position after the events of December
   14, 1885 (Ciel's 10th birthday), when the Phantomhive manor was
   attacked by unidentified perpetrators and was set ablaze. Ciel, amidst
   the chaos, discovers his parents, Vincent and Rachel Phantomhive, to be
   dead along with the family dog, Sebastian. The same night he is
   kidnapped by the attackers and then sold into slavery, where he ends up
   in the hands of a sadistic, demon-worshipping cult. Ciel then endures
   endless physical, mental and sexual abuse at the hands of his captors.
   Ciel was also heat branded with a mark referred to as the "mark of the
   beast". One night, during a sacrificial ceremony to summon a demon,
   instead of forming a contract with the cult members, the demon states
   that he was summoned by Ciel, therefore he only agrees to form a
   contract with him, killing all the cultist members in the process. To
   show a contract was formed, the demon places a contract symbol referred
   to as the Faustian contract symbol on Ciel's right eye, giving it a
   purple hue, and his iris and pupil now showcase the symbol of the
   covenant. After the formation of the contract, the demon reveals he
   will consume Ciel's soul as payment for helping him achieve his goal;
   revenge on those who brought down the House of Phantomhive. Afterwards
   Ciel names the demon Sebastian Michaelis, after his deceased pet dog.
   The duo then return to society as Ciel takes over his now late father's
   previous position as the queen's watchdog, a very high-profile
   individual who is tasked with investigating cases that Queen Victoria
   herself deems especially important or threatening to England and the
   crown.
