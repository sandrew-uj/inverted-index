   Myron's family intended for Myron to follow a staid and respectable
   career in economics; however, when his wealthy and eccentric great-aunt
   Dame Hester came into possession of a space yacht, Myron suddenly found
   his long suppressed dreams of adventure within reach. Serving as Dame
   Hester's nominal captain on her journey to find a clinic reputed to
   restore lost youth to wealthy clients, Myron soon finds that his aunt
   is capricious as she is flamboyant, and after an argument, finds
   himself castaway on a remote planet. With no resources to return home,
   he obtains the position of supercargo on a tramp freighter, which
   enables him to travel further across the Gaean Reach to exotic lands.
