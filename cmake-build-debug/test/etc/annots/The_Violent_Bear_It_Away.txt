   Mason Tarwater, an outspoken evangelist and self-ordained prophet, dies
   many years after kidnapping his great-nephew Francis, raising him in a
   backwoods cabin and preparing him to someday take his place as a
   prophet. Prior to his death, Mason asked the now-teenaged Francis to
   give him a proper Christian burial with a cross marking the grave so
   that his body would be resurrected on Judgment Day. Francis starts to
   dig the grave but suddenly hears a "Voice" in his head telling him to
   forget about the old man. Francis obeys and gets drunk instead. When
   Francis wakes from his drunken sleep, he sets the cabin on fire,
   believing that his great-uncle's body is still inside. He leaves for
   the city and gets a ride from a salesman, who drops him off at his
   Uncle Rayber's house.

   Rayber, a well-educated schoolteacher, is amazed to see young Francis,
   whom he had long ago given up on after his kidnapping by Mason. Francis
   is also greeted at the door by Rayber's young son Bishop, who (it is
   implied) has Down syndrome and low intelligence. Bishop is Rayber's
   child with Bernice Bishop, a meddlesome social worker whom Mason had
   referred to as "the welfare woman." The old man had previously told
   Francis that Bernice was much older than Rayber and only able to give
   him one disabled child, and that God had mercy on the child by making
   him "dim-witted," which was the only way to protect him from his evil
   parents. Mason had commissioned Francis to baptize Bishop at some
   point, in order to save the little boy's soul. Due to this history,
   Francis is immediately put on edge when confronted with Bishop, but
   decides to stay with his uncle anyway. Francis does not think of Bishop
   as a human being and finds him repulsive.

   The three begin to live together as a family for a while, and Rayber is
   excited to have his nephew back in order to raise him as a normal boy
   and provide him with a proper education. However, Francis resists his
   uncle's attempts at secular reform very much the same way he resisted
   Mason's attempts at religious reform. Rayber understands what Francis
   is going through, as he himself had been kidnapped as a child by Mason,
   but Rayber's father had managed to rescue him.

   After many attempts by Rayber to "civilize" the reluctant Tarwater, and
   many attempts by Tarwater to figure out his true destiny (either as a
   prophet, which was his great-uncle's wish, or as an enlightened,
   educated modern man, which is his uncle Rayber's wish), Rayber devises
   a plan to take Tarwater back to the farm where Tarwater had been raised
   in the hope that confronting his past will allow him to leave it
   behind. Under the guise of taking the two boys out to a country lodge
   to go fishing, Rayber finally confronts Tarwater, telling him that he
   must accept an ordinary life and ignore the superstitious Christian
   upbringing and the false destiny with which his great-uncle has
   corrupted him. Tarwater, however, is not so easily convinced. While at
   the lodge, he again hears the "Voice" (the devil) who tells Tarwater to
   forsake his great-uncle's command to baptize Bishop and to drown the
   boy instead. One evening, Tarwater takes Bishop out on a boat to the
   middle of the lake, with Rayber's reluctant blessing. Rayber cannot see
   them on the lake but can still hear their voices. Tarwater ends up
   drowning Bishop while at the same time baptizing the boy, thereby
   fulfilling both destinies simultaneously. Rayber realizes what has
   happened and faints, not out of fear for his son's life, but because he
   feels nothing at his son's death.

   Tarwater runs away into the woods and tries to make his way back to his
   great-uncle's house to confront his demons once and for all. He
   eventually hitches a ride with another man, who entices Tarwater to get
   drunk. Tarwater takes the man's offer and passes out, eventually waking
   up naked against a tree with his clothes neatly folded beside him. He
   dresses hurriedly and sets fire to the area.

   Burning his way through the forest, Tarwater finally makes his way back
   to Powderhead, his great-uncle's old farm, where he finds the cabin has
   burned to the ground. Tarwater had assumed that his great-uncle had
   been burned up with it, but Buford, a black man who lived nearby, had
   actually rescued old Mason Tarwater's body from the house while
   Tarwater was drunk at the beginning of the novel, and gave the old man
   a proper Christian burial just as he had requested. Tarwater realizes
   that his great-uncle's two main requests (that he be given a proper
   burial and that Tarwater's nephew Bishop be baptized) have been
   realized, which convinces Tarwater that he can no longer run away from
   his calling to be a prophet. The story ends with Tarwater heading
   toward the city to fulfill his calling to "Go warn the children of God
   of the terrible speed of mercy."
