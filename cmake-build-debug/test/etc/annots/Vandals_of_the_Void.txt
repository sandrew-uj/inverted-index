   Fifteen-year-old Dick Murdock lives in Miracle Valley on Venus. He is
   invited to spend his summer holidays with his father Paul, who was
   recently promoted Chief Astronomer at an observatory on the Moon. At
   the space dock he hears hushed conversations among the passengers about
   the space liners Canopus and Capella being attacked. As he boards the
   African Star, he learns their sister ship, American Star, is missing.
   During the voyage, they come across the hulk of the American Star,
   adrift in The Graveyard of Space with everyone aboard dead. Another
   passenger bound for the Moon, Sende, appears to know more about these
   events than he is willing to admit.

   Dick reaches the Moon without further incident. While shuttling down to
   the observatory they fly over the ruins of a former United Nations
   Security Station missile base, long abandoned as war is no longer a
   problem on Earth. Dick is sure he sees a light in the Station, but
   Sende dismisses it as a reflection. Shortly after arriving, a newly
   built UN corvette arrives and informs them of the presence of space
   pirates who attack the liners and then return with a prize crew to
   modify them into warships. They ask the observatory to keep track of
   ships moving through The Graveyard, hoping to spot the pirate ships and
   find their base of operations.

   Dick makes friends with a prospector, "Crazy Sam" Baxter, who takes
   Dick on prospecting trips on his rocket sled. When later questioned by
   the UN crew, Sam claims he has met native moon people who live
   underground in tunnels. Later, Dick is listening to his radio when he
   hears a broadcast consisting of letters and digits, some form of code.
   The next morning he learns the African Star has been attacked. Dick
   attempts to decode the message and realizes they were entries in a new
   star atlas being developed at the observatory. The message indicates
   the route of the Star.

   Days later, Sam is killed in an accident and Dick retrieves his maps of
   the natural tunnels under the UN base. Dick returns to the observatory
   to find his father has been called away to Venus to tend to his mother.
   He realizes this is a ruse and flies the sled to the ship. He
   commandeers the liner, changing course just before they are intercepted
   by two of the pirate ships. They return to the observatory where they
   are once again met by the UN crew. They note that the radio messages
   Dick heard were not being heard on Earth, meaning they must be short
   range signals. Dick realizes the pirates are in the Security Station.
   He sneaks out of the observatory and uses Sam's maps to enter the base
   unseen. As he watches the pirates eat, the Basilisk arrives, a man with
   enormous yellow hypnotic eyes. Dick is enthralled and captured, but
   later escapes with a photograph of the Basilisk.

   He returns to the base to find everyone is out looking for him. While
   he develops the photograph, he is approached by Professor Dexter, the
   base's second-in-command. Dick recognizes his eyes as those of the
   Basilisk. Dexter realizes he has been identified and attempts to kill
   Dick by locking him in the darkroom with prussic acid, but Sende
   arrives and interrupts Dexter's parting evil monologue. Dexter rockets
   to the Security Station and launches his pirate ships to attack a city
   on Mars.

   Dick and Sende, revealed to be a UN operative, are picked up by the
   newly forming Space Navy as they attempt to intercept the pirate fleet.
   They meet over Mars, where the small Navy ships are outgunned by the
   much larger pirates. A running battle ensues, and the tide is turned by
   the arrival of a much larger Navy cruiser, fresh from the shipyards.
   Dexter attempts to escape in a small ship, but Sende shoots it down
   with a single well-aimed shot. In the aftermath, the Commodore of the
   Navy invites Dick to join their forces once he is old enough.
