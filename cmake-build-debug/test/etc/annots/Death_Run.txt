   Just before a nuclear war breaks out, a scientist at the British
   National Research Centre puts Paul (Rob Bartlett) and his girlfriend
   Jenny (Wendy Parsons) into suspended animation so they can live to see
   better days. 25 years later, the unit runs out of power and the couple
   is reanimated.

   They camp in peace for a few days, until they are beset and captured by
   a biker gang. The gang take Jenny and Paul to their home, a decadent
   city led by the Messiah (Patrick Olliver), a nazi chic-wearing
   megalomaniac with a deformed hand. Jenny is enrolled into the Messiah's
   harem while Paul is thrown in a cell. He is contacted by a sympathetic
   jailer called Barbara (Debri Stevens), who promises to arrange his
   escape and spare him from being forced to participate in "the Run".

   A prisoner with no name, known as Hero (Eddie Kirby), joins Paul and
   tells him he was the only man to ever survive the Run. They team up to
   escape: when Barbara arrives to feed them, they initiate a fight with
   her guards, which they win with Barbara's help. They subdue the rest of
   the gang by releasing captive mutants, who gleefully start killing the
   bikers. They then hijack a car and pick up Jenny. They fight some more
   gang members when they reach a gasworks at the outskirts of the city,
   and keep driving until they run out of petrol.

   They encounter a pregnant woman (Kate Kneafsey), who shares their
   hatred of the Messiah and shelters them among her people. A romance
   begins to blossom between Barbara and Hero. That night, however, they
   find Jenny dead and realise that their hosts are cannibals. They kill
   all but the pregnant woman, who reveals that she was raped by the
   Messiah and that the gang were using her resulting pregnancy to make
   her seem sympathetic to the rebels. They forgive her and decide to move
   on to elude pursuit by the Messiah's cronies. They don't go far before
   being ambushed by mutants, and they use up all their petrol
   incinerating them.

   Hero comes up with a plan: he trains Paul until he is fit enough to
   survive the Run, then lets him get captured by the Messiah. Paul
   performs the Run, which turns out to involve running down a hill while
   handcuffed to a metal wire which is fed with high-voltage electricity,
   all while fighting mutants bare-handed. Paul runs down the hill all the
   way into the forest, where the Messiah cannot see him, and thus allows
   Hero to get rid of the mutants for him and break his cuffs. Hero also
   captures a crony and handcuffs him to the wire to act as a decoy.

   The Messiah learns of the trick though, and sends all his men after the
   two. They dispatch most of them with ease, although Hero has a
   protracted wrestling match with a burly crony. He eventually succeeds
   in impaling his opponent with a fence post. The Messiah is finally left
   vulnerable, and his harem girls take turns stabbing him, until Paul
   finishes him off with a machete. Paul promises to end the Messiah's
   evil and found a new society based on good.

   Some time later, Paul is building a house for his village of good. The
   pregnant woman has had her baby, and he allows her to shelter in the
   house to breastfeed. The film ends with a shot of the baby's hand,
   which is deformed just like the Messiah's.
