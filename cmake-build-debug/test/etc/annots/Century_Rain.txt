   Wendell Floyd is an expatriate American living in an alternate version
   of 1950s Paris. In this world, the Nazi invasion of France failed, and
   Hitler was deposed by the German High Command. Without World War II,
   technology in this world has stagnated at 1930s levels, and Fascist
   political parties have gained power in France.

   Floyd is a part-time jazz musician whose career has stalled since his
   ex-girlfriend, Greta, left Paris to pursue a musical career touring
   with another jazz band. He and his band-mate Andre Custine earn a
   supplemental income working as private detectives. When the novel
   opens, Floyd and Custine are hired by a concerned landlord to
   investigate the death of one of his tenants. Blanchard, the landlord,
   is certain that the death of Susan White, which the Parisian police
   have written off as an accident, is murder. Floyd is not so certain,
   but he's willing to investigate.

   In a scene seemingly from another novel, Verity Auger finds herself
   responsible when her archaeology dig beneath the frozen ruins of some
   far-flung future Paris results in the death of one of her students.
   During her trial she is caught up in political infighting, and
   maneuvered into accepting a high risk assignment, without knowing what
   it entails.

   But when she is summoned on a mission to Mars by the top-secret
   security agency Contingencies, Auger is more than relieved to be exempt
   from her tribunal and the years of prison that she would otherwise have
   to face. However, when she is taken to a secret underground base on the
   Martian moon Phobos containing an ancient alien relic that opens a
   portal to a distant part of the galaxy, and told that she is to go
   through it, she begins to have second thoughts about continuing with
   her mission. Things get even more bizarre when she finds out that at
   the other end of the portal is an alternate-history version of Earth in
   the year 1959 -- almost 300 years behind her present-day -- and that
   she is to retrieve a tin of documents that was left behind by Susan
   White, an earlier agent sent to "Earth Two", who died under mysterious
   circumstances.
