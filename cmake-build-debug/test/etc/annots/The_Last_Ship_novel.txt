   The story is told in a first-person point of view by the ship's
   commanding officer, "Thomas", whose full name is never revealed. Thomas
   is writing this account several months after the war in order to
   describe the odyssey of his Norwegian-homeported ship, USS Nathan James
   (DDG-80), in the aftermath of the conflict.

   Thomas begins by describing his ship to the reader. He discusses the
   ethics of commanding a warship, the capabilities of nuclear strike
   forces, daily life aboard a U.S. Navy ship in the Arctic Circle, and
   the nature of his ship's mission. Captain Thomas remarks that, despite
   the reduction in the land-based ICBM arsenal, there is still
   considerable power in the SLBMs and Tomahawks; his ship alone has more
   power than several missile silos combined.
