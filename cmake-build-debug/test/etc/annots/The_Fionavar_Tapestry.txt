   The Fionavar Tapestry is a trilogy of fantasy novels by Canadian author
   Guy Gavriel Kay, published between 1984 and 1986. The novels are partly
   set in our own contemporary world, but mostly in the fictional world of
   Fionavar. It is the story of five University of Toronto senior law and
   medical students, who are drawn into the 'first world of the Tapestry'
   by the mage Loren Silvercloak. Once there, each discovers his or her
   own role and destiny in the framework of an epic conflict. The books'
   original cover illustrations were created by Martin Springett.^[1]
