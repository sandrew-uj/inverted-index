   Firebird is a science fiction romance by American writer Kathy Tyers;
   originally published in 1986, it was rewritten as Christian science
   fiction and republished in 1999. The second edition is part one of
   a three-part series, entitled Firebird: A Trilogy.

   The protagonist is Lady Firebird Angelo, a wastling of the Naetai royal
   family. Wastlings are younger offspring of noble houses who are doomed
   to geis, or honorable suicide, so as not to upset the succession of
   their older siblings (and their children) to political power. Firebird
   disagrees with the actions of her government, but is compelled by honor
   to support it.
