   It tells the story of a boy growing to manhood in the land of Shant, a
   society composed of many different, and wildly individual cantons, some
   of which are run by cults. Each adult wears an explosive torc which can
   be detonated by remote command, bringing about instant death by
   decapitation. The torcs are controlled by an anonymous dictator, the
   Anome, whose identity is literally unknown. Because those whose heads
   are exploded are selected primarily by the cantonal leaders, for
   violations of local law, the Anome is able to operate with only a
   handful of assistants, or 'Benevolences', who themselves do not know
   his identity.
