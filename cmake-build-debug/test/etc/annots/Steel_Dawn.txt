   Nomad (Patrick Swayze), a swordsman, wanders through the desert in a
   post-World War III world. He searches for his mentor's killer, the
   assassin Sho (Christopher Neame). In the past, Nomad had a position of
   privilege as a soldier of the elite guard. Nomad's family were killed
   and this continues to torture him. Nomad encounters a group of settlers
   in the town of Meridian. Damnil (Anthony Zerbe), a local landowner, and
   his gang are attacking the town to gain a monopoly on the local water
   supply. Nomad stays at a local farm owned by the widow Kasha (Lisa
   Niemi). She has a son, Jux, who quickly endears himself to Nomad. Kasha
   reveals to Nomad that she has a source of pure water under her land and
   plans to eventually irrigate the whole valley.

   Nomad teams up with Kasha's foreman, Tark (Brion James), to oppose
   Damnil and his bullying tactics. Meanwhile, Nomad and Kasha's
   relationship becomes romantic. Sho and some of Damnil's men show up in
   town, leading to Sho and Nomad having a brutal staff fight. Tark gets
   in the way and is stabbed in the abdomen by Sho and dies. Jux is
   kidnapped by Damnil's men. Nomad plans to rescue Jux, but is locked in
   a safe with his sword by Kasha. She goes to Damnil's farm alone,
   offering to reveal her source of water if they free Jux. A stand-off
   ensues, allowing Jux to escape. As Damnil's men chase him down, Nomad
   comes just in time to save Jux's life. Nomad and Jux return to Damnil's
   farm to rescue Kasha. Nomad has a final battle with Sho. Nomad is
   victorious and kills Damnil as well. The valley begins Kasha's
   irrigation project. Nomad bids farewell to Kasha and Jux. They watch as
   he walks into the desert.
