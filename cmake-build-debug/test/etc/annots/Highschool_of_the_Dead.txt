   Highschool of the Dead is set in present-day Japan, beginning as the
   world is struck by a deadly pandemic that turns humans into zombies,
   euphemistically referred to by the main characters as "Them" (ra,
   Yatsu-ra). The story follows a group of high school students and the
   school's nurse as they deal with the worldwide catastrophic event known
   as the "Outbreak". As the cast tries to survive the zombie apocalypse,
   they must also face the additional threats of societal collapse, in the
   form of dangerous fellow survivors, and the possible decay of their own
   moral codes. Starting from the high school, the students escape into
   town where they must deal with a corrupt teacher and his students. They
   check their homes for survivors, and pick up a little girl and a dog.
   Later, they hole up at a mall, travel through a police station, and
   eventually make their way to an elementary school that is supposedly a
   safe zone.
