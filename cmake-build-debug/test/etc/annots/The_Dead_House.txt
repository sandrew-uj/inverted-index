   At the beginning of the novel, the reader is made aware that the book's
   content was compiled from several sources, including a diary that was
   found in the remains of Elmbridge High School, a British high school
   that burned down 25 years prior. The material is a mixture of video
   clips, interviews, recovered diary entries, and other similar items,
   and will occasionally have notations about missing content. Throughout
   the book, Kaitlyn repeatedly refers to her diary as "Dee" in her
   entries.

   Carly and Kaitlyn Johnson are two personalities that exist in the same
   body. They've been living in a mental hospital for an undisclosed
   amount of time and it is established that their parents died in a
   horrific accident that they cannot remember. They are aware of each
   other's existence, but they never directly interact as Carly is only
   active during the day and Kaitlyn at night, although they do
   communicate through various means, which they attempt to hide from
   others. In the mental hospital their therapist diagnoses them as having
   dissociative identity disorder, an eating disorder (Carly),
   self-harming (Kaitlyn), and hearing voices (Kaitlyn, who dubs the voice
   Aka Manah). She also believes that Kaitlyn is not the true personality
   and that Carly created her as a coping mechanism, although Kaitlyn
   insists that she is real and existed before their parents' deaths.

   When school starts Carly/Kaitlyn is sent to Elmbridge where Carly is
   reunited with her spiritual friend Naida, who believes that both
   personalities are real and that they're two souls in one body. As the
   semester progresses Kaitlyn uses an attic in an abandoned building as a
   refuge and meets Ari, with whom she reluctantly falls in love. Her
   peace is short-lived as Kaitlyn begins to see visions of a menacing
   dead girl and becomes stressed when she cannot see her little sister
   Jaimie, who was placed into foster care. Things come to a head when
   Carly stops emerging, provoking Kaitlyn into attempting suicide, which
   sends her back to the mental institution. Their therapist is surprised
   since she assumed that Carly was the dominant personality, but assumes
   that this is a sign of both personalities merging. During this time she
   comes back into contact with her friend John, who she hasn't seen since
   her parents' accident. Naida asks Kaitlyn to break herself out of the
   hospital, fearing that a Shyan, a dark magic user, is after
   Kaitlyn/Carly because of the power held by dual souls.

   Once escaped, Naida hides Kaitlyn in the school basement and reveals
   Kaitlyn's location - and the secret of the dual souls - to their
   friends, who are surprised and skeptical but supportive. As Kaitlyn
   hides she continues to experience more terrifying supernatural
   phenomena, prompting her and Naida to travel to London to see her
   brother Haji, a powerful dark magician that gives them some information
   about their situation. Naida believes that Kaitlyn has been possessed
   by an evil spirit and ultimately decides to hold a ritual to travel
   into her mind, into the dead house itself. Sometime after entering the
   house she and Kaitlyn are attacked by the evil spirit. This abruptly
   ends the ritual and for some unknown reason Naida immediately cuts off
   her tongue.

   Naida's brother Haji decides to re-do Naida's ritual and Kaitlyn, Haji,
   Brett, John, and Naida's boyfriend Scott travel into her mind. Once
   there Haji discovers that Shyan is one of Kaitlyn's friends. Kaitlyn
   also begins to fear her friend John for reasons she cannot explain.
   Diary entry from Carly is inserted into the book about this time that
   shows that she was also afraid of one of the people around her, a boy
   named Brett that had a crush on Carly, unaware that the personality he
   had met was Kaitlyn. After the ritual Kaitlyn is approached by John,
   who reveals that he wants her to go back to the asylum and that her
   parents died in a car accident, as her father had been distracted while
   arguing with Kaitlyn, and that after the accident she told John (who
   had also been in the car) that the accident was the happiest day of her
   life. Kaitlyn also tries to discover the Shyan's identity via a charm
   supplied by Haji. She had suspected Brett after reading a diary entry
   where he tried to force himself on Carly, but when his dead body is
   found her suspicions turn to John. That night Kaitlyn accidentally
   kills John while trying to break up a fight between him and Ari. Though
   saddened by John's death, Kaitlyn notices that things appear to be
   calming down. She also realizes that the dead girl she had been seeing
   was trying to assist her rather than menace her. Kaitlyn also believes
   that she has a way to reunite herself with Carly and resolves to find
   her regardless of the cost.

   The book then cuts to an undated diary entry where it's revealed that
   John was not the Shyan - rather it was Ari, who did everything because
   he believed that Carly and the others were holding Kaitlyn back from
   her true life. He also tells her that he was not responsible for
   everything that has been happening and that the demon possessing her
   was summoned by Carly. Ari furthermore tells Kaitlyn that she was
   responsible for the murder of a missing girl committed while the demon
   was in control. (Naida later insists to a detective that Ari killed the
   girl as a sacrifice to bargain with the demon.) The book then shows
   Kaitlyn writing to Dee that Ari cannot hurt them, insinuating that she
   has killed him. Kaitlyn then realizes that the demon in her is evil and
   will continue to harm more people. As a result, she commits suicide by
   self-immolation, resulting in the school burning down. The book ends
   with Carly/Kaitlyn's therapist, whose license has been revoked and is
   now a paranormal researcher, appears on a paranormal radio show to deny
   claims that the book's events were supernatural despite multiple
   disappearances at the school site and the authorities' inability to
   locate Carly/Kaitlyn's body.
