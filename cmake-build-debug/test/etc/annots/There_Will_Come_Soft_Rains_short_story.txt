   The texts for The Martian Chronicles versions of "There Will Come Soft
   Rains" are the same except for dates. The differences between the
   original and The Martian Chronicles stories may seem minor, but some
   are significant. In particular, the Chronicles version indicates the
   author's intent on strengthening the anti-war message of the story by
   commemorating the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and implicitly
   emphasizing the pacifistic sentiments of Sara Teasdale. In addition,
   the Chronicles version presents a leaner, more refined narrative with
   the omission of a prologue contained in the original and several
   changes to sentence structure.
