   The stories are set in twentieth-century Wales and revolve around a boy
   named Gwyn Griffiths, who is descended from magicians, although neither
   parent believes that family lore.^[6] On his ninth birthday grandmother
   Nain Griffiths gives him five odd gifts that take him on a quest to
   discover whether he is a magician like his Celtic ancestors. They help
   him to unravel the mystery of his sister Bethan, who disappeared on his
   birthday four years ago.^[6]

   In the sequel Gwyn again uses magical power to handle an outside threat
   to his family, and to resolve conflict within it.^[7] In the conclusion
   he strives to heal a soldier veteran of the Belfast Troubles, rather
   than anyone in his family.^[8]
