   In 1899, Dr. Alexander Hartdegen is an inventor teaching at Columbia
   University in New York City. Unlike his friend David Philby, Alexander
   would rather do pure research than work in the world of business. After
   a mugger kills his fiancee, Emma, he devotes himself to building a time
   machine that will allow him to travel back in time to save her. When he
   completes the machine four years later, he travels back to 1899 and
   prevents her murder, only to see her killed again when a horseless
   carriage frightens the horses of a horse-drawn vehicle.

   Alexander realizes that any attempt to save Emma will result in her
   death through other circumstances. Distraught, Alexander travels to
   2030 to discover whether science has been able to solve his question of
   how to change the past. At the New York Public Library, a holographic
   librarian called Vox 114 insists that time travel is impossible.
   Alexander travels to 2037, when the accidental destruction of the Moon
   by lunar colonists has begun rendering the Earth virtually
   uninhabitable. While restarting the time machine to avoid debris, he is
   knocked unconscious and travels to the year 802,701 before reawakening.

   The human race has reverted to a primitive lifestyle and the Earth has
   healed. Some survivors, called "Eloi", live on the sides of cliffs of
   what was once Manhattan. Alexander is nursed back to health by a woman
   named Mara, one of the few Eloi who speak English. He observes the
   broken moon and suggests that maybe his teachings led to this future.
   One night, Alexander and Mara's young brother, Kalen, dream of a
   frightening, jagged-toothed face and a creature calling their name.
   Alexander informs Mara of the dream and she tells him they all have
   that dream, and she notices that his watch is missing. The next day,
   the Eloi are attacked and Mara is dragged underground by ape-like
   monsters. The creatures are called "Morlocks" and they hunt the Eloi
   for food. In order to rescue her, Kalen leads Alexander to Vox 114,
   which is still functional after 800,000 years.

   After learning from Vox how to find the Morlocks, Alexander enters
   their underground lair through an opening that resembles the face in
   his nightmare. He is captured and thrown into an area where Mara sits
   in a cage. Alexander meets an intelligent, humanoid Morlock, who
   explains that Morlocks are the evolutionary descendants of the humans
   who went underground after the Moon broke apart, while the Eloi are
   evolved from those who remained on the surface. The humanoid Morlocks
   are a caste of telepaths who rule the other Morlocks.

   The Morlock explains that Alexander cannot alter Emma's fate, because
   her death is what drove him to build the time machine in the first
   place: saving her would be a virtual impossibility due to temporal
   paradox. He then reveals that the Morlocks have brought the time
   machine underground, and tells Alexander to get into it and return
   home. Alexander gets into the machine but pulls the Morlock in with
   him, carrying them into the future as they fight. The Morlock dies by
   rapidly aging when Alexander pushes him outside of the machine's
   temporal bubble. Alexander stops in the year 635,427,810, revealing a
   harsh, rust-colored sky over a wasteland of Morlock caves.

   Accepting that he cannot save Emma, Alexander travels back to rescue
   Mara. After freeing her, he starts the time machine and jams its gears,
   creating a violent distortion in time. Pursued by the Morlocks,
   Alexander and Mara escape to the surface as the time distortion
   explodes, killing the Morlocks and destroying their caves along with
   the time machine. Alexander begins a new life with Mara and the Eloi.

   In 1903, Philby and Mrs. Watchit, Alexander's housekeeper, are in his
   laboratory discussing his absence. Philby tells Mrs. Watchit he is glad
   that Alexander has gone to a place where he can find peace, then tells
   her that he would like to hire her as a housekeeper, which she accepts
   until Alexander returns. Mrs. Watchit bids Alexander farewell and
   Philby leaves, looking toward the laboratory affectionately, then
   throws his bowler hat away in tribute to Alexander's distaste for
   conformity.
