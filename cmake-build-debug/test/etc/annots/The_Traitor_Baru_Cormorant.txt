   As a child, Baru Cormorant's island of Taranoke is annexed by the
   Imperial Republic of Falcrest, called the Masquerade because of the
   masks worn by its officials. They kill one of Baru's fathers and
   institute their own rigid belief system focused on hygiene and
   puritanical sexual ethics. Baru is educated at a Masquerade school, but
   vows to work her way upward within the Empire and eventually free her
   island.

   At her school, Baru demonstrates extreme mathematical prowess. She is
   noticed by Cairdine Farrier, a high-ranking Masquerade official.
   Farrier elevates her to the position of Imperial Accountant of
   Aurdwynn, a province of thirteen duchies that often rebels against
   Masquerade rule. Baru uses her financial expertise to manipulate the
   Masquerade's fiat currency system. This causes rapid inflation and
   widespread poverty, but crushes an incipient rebellion by Duchess Tain
   Hu. Eventually, Baru becomes friendly with Tain Hu and other Aurdwynni
   nobles; she agrees to join them in revolt against the Masquerade. Baru
   uses her financial powers to grant loans to the commoners, which
   enriches Aurdwynn and ensures that her rebellion will gain popular
   support.

   Baru leads an army against the Masquerade forces and takes Tain Hu as
   her lover. After a brief victory, the Aurdwynni army is ambushed by the
   Masquerade navy. The rebellious dukes and duchesses are all killed
   except for Tain Hu. Baru reveals that she has been an agent of the
   Masquerade throughout the rebellion; in exchange for crushing the
   nobility in Aurdwynn, she will be given rule of Taranoke and elevated
   to the Masquerade's ruling clique. As a final test of loyalty, the
   Masquerade committee members ask Baru to kill Tain Hu. They then offer
   to spare her in exchange for Baru's loyalty. Hu signals that she does
   not wish to be used as a pawn. In obedience to her lover's wishes, Baru
   allows Tain Hu to be executed. This choice protects Baru from
   blackmail, leaving her free to pursue revenge against the Empire.
