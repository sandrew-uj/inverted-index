   Fifty years after a nuclear holocaust, mankind is decimated and the
   surviving nations--the western-influenced Market and the
   Russian-influenced Confederation--have agreed to outlaw traditional
   open war. In their place, disputes are settled with gladiator-style
   matches between giant robots operated by pilots called "robot jox" who
   are contracted to fight ten matches. The Confederation champion is
   Alexander (Paul Koslo), who has killed his last nine opponents thanks
   in part to a spy in the Market leaking information to the
   Confederation. The Market's champion, Achilles (Gary Graham) has won
   nine fights and will fight his final match against Alexander for the
   territory of Alaska. Achilles is supported by robot designer "Doc"
   Matsumoto (Danny Kamekona) and strategist Tex Conway (Michael
   Alldredge), the only jox to win all ten of his contract fights.

   As Achilles gets the upper hand in the match, Alexander launches a
   rocket fist at him. The projectile goes out of control and heads toward
   the bleachers. Achilles intercepts the projectile but his robot takes
   the full force of the impact and is knocked into the crowd, killing
   over 300 people. The referees declare the match a draw and order a
   rematch, but Achilles, shaken by what happened, declares this was his
   contractual tenth match and announces his retirement. He goes to live
   with his brother Philip and his family, and finds he is publicly
   branded a traitor and a coward. Meanwhile, a new jox is chosen to face
   Alexander, a genetically engineered "gen jox" named Athena (Anne-Marie
   Johnson), who is the first female jox. Worried for Athena and attracted
   to her, Achilles returns to the Market and agrees to fight Alexander
   again, infuriating Athena.

   As Achilles' robot is rebuilt, Matsumoto refuses to divulge any
   knowledge of its new weapons so it cannot be leaked by the spy, and
   Conway confides in Achilles he believes Matsumoto is the spy. Conway
   confronts Matsumoto in his office. Matsumoto reveals he has analyzed
   Conway's final fight and deduced that the "lucky" laser hit Conway
   claims allowed him to defeat a clearly superior opponent was in fact
   deliberately aimed; Matsumoto accuses Conway of being a Confederation
   agent. Conway confesses and shoots Matsumoto, who secretly records the
   deed as part of the mission briefing. Conway informs the Market
   leadership that Matsumoto was the spy. On the day of the fight Athena
   drugs Achilles and steals his jox suit to commandeer the robot. Unable
   to stop the fight once she takes the field, the Market decides to
   support her. While watching Matsumoto's briefing on the robot's new
   weaponry, the footage of Conway killing Matsumoto is played and Conway
   jumps down the robot's elevator shaft to his death.

   Alexander takes the field against Athena. Athena takes the early
   advantage, but Alexander overpowers her and incapacitates the robot.
   The fight is declared in Alexander's favor and referees order him to
   stand down. Achilles arrives on the field and takes over the robot from
   Athena while Alexander smashes the referee hovercraft; the two jox
   stand to continue the fight. Both robots take to the air and a short
   space battle ensues. Alexander critically damages Achilles' robot,
   forcing him to crash land and flee for cover to the arm of Alexander's
   robot Athena sliced off earlier in the fight. Achilles hotwires the arm
   to launch its fist at Alexander, destroying his robot. Alexander
   emerges from the wreckage and the two battle with poles before Achilles
   finally convinces Alexander a match does not have to end with the death
   of a jock. Alexander throws down his weapon, and they salute each other
   with the jox's traditional "crash and burn" fist bump.
