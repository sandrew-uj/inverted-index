   A framing story in the first two chapters describes the world of the
   novel as Mercury, though it is clearly a fantasy version of Earth, a
   "secondary world"; no effort was made to conform to the scientific
   knowledge of Mercury as it existed at the time of writing. At a number
   of points the characters refer to their land as Middle earth, used here
   in its original sense of "the known world", and the gods worshiped have
   the names of deities from Greek mythology.

   Oddly, the introductory framing story has a beginning, but is not
   referred to once the actual fantasy adventure begins. (Framing, as a
   technique, usually opens and closes a separate story contained inside
   the frame-narrative.)

   The framing story having introduced the chief lords of Demonland--the
   brothers Juss, Spitfire, and Goldry Bluszco, and their cousin Brandoch
   Daha--the story begins in earnest with a dwarf ambassador from
   Witchland arriving in Demonland to demand that the Demons recognize
   King Gorice XI of Witchland as their overlord. Juss and his brothers
   reply that they and all of Demonland will submit if the king (a famous
   wrestler) can defeat Goldry Bluszco in a wrestling match.

   The match is held in the neutral territory of the Foliot Isles, and
   Gorice is killed. His successor (or reincarnation) Gorice XII is a
   sorcerer who banishes Goldry to an enchanted mountain prison, by means
   of a perilous sorcery requiring the help of the devious Goblin traitor
   Lord Gro.

   While Lord Spitfire is sent back to raise an army out of Demonland,
   Lord Juss and his cousin Brandoch Daha, aided by King Gaslark of
   Goblinland, attempt an assault on Carce, the capital of the Witches,
   where they think Goldry is held. The rescue fails, the Goblins flee,
   and Juss and Brandoch Daha are both captured. They escape with the aid
   of La Fireez, the prince of Pixyland and vassal of King Gorice, who
   helps them at great personal cost because he owes them a debt of honor.

   Juss and Brandoch Daha return home to Demonland and then start an
   expedition to rescue Goldry Bluszco from his terrible prison, somewhere
   past the mountains of Impland. Lord Spitfire again stays behind to lead
   Demonland's armies against an expected invasion from Witchland.

   The expedition's fleet is smashed and its army destroyed. Juss and
   Brandoch Daha meet with three strange enchanted heroes of an earlier
   time, and Lord Juss is later nearly killed by a manticore. After a year
   of wandering they climb the mighty peak of Koshtra Pivrarcha and then
   attempt the even more difficult peak of Koshtra Belorn. Before reaching
   the summit of Koshtra Belorn they encounter Queen Sophonisba, a royal
   from that area to whom the gods had granted eternal youth when her
   realm was laid waste by the Witches.

   From Sophonisba they learn that Goldry is held in prison on the top of
   Zora Rach Nam, a mountain which cannot be climbed and whose peak is
   surrounded by unceasing flames. There is only one way to free him: they
   must find a hippogriff's egg, and one of them must ride the newly
   hatched hippogriff. Queen Sophonisba gives Lord Juss one hippogriff
   egg. Alas, their lone companion, the Impland native Mivarsh Faz
   (fearing that he will have to walk back home alone, if the Demons get
   the hippogriff) steals the egg and tries to use it himself, causing his
   death. Lord Juss and Brandoch Daha set out for home, their quest
   defeated for the time being. But matters are not completely hopeless,
   as one of Queen Sophonisba's martlet scouts have told them of another
   hippogriff egg, lying at the bottom of a lake in Demonland.

   Meanwhile, the armies of Witchland have attacked Demonland. Duke Corsus
   is the first commander of the Witchland army, and conquers part of
   Demonland, but is defeated by Spitfire. A new Witchland army, under the
   command of Lord Corinius, defeats Spitfire and captures most of
   Demonland. This includes Brandoch Daha's castle of Krothering, which
   had been watched over by his sister Lady Mevrian.

   At this point, Lord Gro changes sides and helps Lady Mevrian escape
   from the grasp of Corinius, who wishes to marry her against her will. A
   few months later, Lord Juss and Brandoch Daha return and expel the
   Witches from Demonland.

   Equipped with a new hippogriff egg, Lord Juss makes a second attempt to
   rescue his brother, and this time is successful. However, his forces
   are trapped in an inland sea by the Witchland navy; forced to engage in
   battle directly, they completely destroy that navy. La Fireez dies in
   this battle.

   The Demons then sail to Carce and face the remaining forces of
   Witchland in a climactic struggle. In the battle, Lord Gro is lambasted
   by Corund for switching sides; Gro responds by killing a Demon and is
   himself killed by Spitfire. Corund dies from wounds he suffers fighting
   with the heroes of Demonland.

   His armies having failed, King Gorice attempts another terrible
   summoning; lacking the aid of Gro, he is unable to complete the spell
   and is destroyed. Duke Corsus poisons the remaining nobles of
   Witchland, and is killed himself by the dying Corinius.

   Though triumphant, the Demon lords find that victory is bitter because
   there are no more enemies worthy of their heroism, no more great deeds
   to perform. Sophonisba, seeking to reward their heroism, prays to the
   gods who return the world to how it had been four years before. And so,
   with a blare of trumpets, an ambassador from Witchland arrives,
   "craving present audience" and the story starts anew.
