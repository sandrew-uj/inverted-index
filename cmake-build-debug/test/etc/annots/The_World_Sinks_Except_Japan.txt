   In the year 2011 the greatest tectonic disaster in the history of
   mankind occurs. As a result of catastrophic earthquakes, massive
   volcanic eruptions, and huge tsunamis, North and South America,
   Eurasia, Africa and Australia have sunken underwater while the Japanese
   islands remain untouched, thanks to the Chinese land which has sunk and
   gone underneath them.

   Japan suddenly discovers that it is the destination for all the world's
   surviving refugees. Consequently, they are all forced to make
   uncomfortable adjustments in order to share the world's last habitable
   landmass. However, they finally discover that the Japanese islands will
   eventually sink as well since the Chinese land supporting them is
   moving rapidly towards the Pacific Ocean.
