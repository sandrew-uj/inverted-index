   Continuing his quest to reach the glorious southern realm of Khurdisan
   the Golden, Brak, a blond, braided and broadsword-wielding barbarian
   from the frozen north, reaches the sea, where he hopes to find a ship
   to take him to his goal. But his party is attacked by raiders who
   capture him and consign him to servitude as a galley slave. And he soon
   learns that the sea contains far worse horrors as well, most notably an
   idol animated by the spirit of a witch seeking vengeance against her
   betrayers.
