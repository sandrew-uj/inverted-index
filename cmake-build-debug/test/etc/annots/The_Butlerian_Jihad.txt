   The Butlerian Jihad introduces a generation of characters whose
   families will later become the most significant in the universe: the
   Atreides, the Corrinos and the Harkonnens. Serena Butler, daughter of
   the viceroy of the League of Nobles, is a strong voice for the human
   rebellion. Her paramour Xavier Harkonnen leads the military force on
   the current League capital world of Salusa Secundus. As the story
   begins, Xavier is repelling an attack on the planet by Omnius' army of
   cymeks. The cymeks are former humans whose brains have been implanted
   in preservation canisters, which in turn can be installed into a
   variety of fearsome mechanical bodies, to extend their lives
   indefinitely and make them nearly unstoppable. The original twenty
   cymeks (calling themselves the Titans) had conquered the complacent
   universe by exploiting humanity's reliance and dependency on machines,
   yet the Titans were later overthrown themselves by Omnius, an
   artificial intelligence of their design. Seeking to replace human chaos
   with machine order, Omnius thus ignited the war between machine and
   humanity. Vorian Atreides is the son and subordinate of the leading
   cymek Titan Agamemnon (whose last name, Atreides, originates with House
   Atreus, from the ancient Greek epic the Iliad).

   Meanwhile, the Sorceresses of Rossak, a matriarchal order, are
   perfecting their destructive psychic powers for use against the
   machines, and maintaining a breeding program to create more powerful
   telepaths. Pharmaceutical magnate Aurelius Venport is about to discover
   an interesting new substance, the spice melange, and the famous
   inventor Tio Holtzman accepts the diminutive genius Norma Cenva into
   his employ.

   Serena is captured by the Titan Barbarossa and put under the watch of
   Erasmus, an independent robot who seeks to understand humans completely
   so that the thinking machines may be truly superior. His methods of
   study often entail human vivisection and torture in his slave pens.
   Erasmus takes a liking to Serena, as does the young Vorian Atreides.
   Serena realizes she is pregnant with Xavier's child, and later gives
   birth to a baby boy whom she names Manion (after her father). Erasmus
   finds this distraction inconvenient, and not only removes Serena's
   uterus but kills her young son in front of her.

   This single event incites the entire Jihad, and young Manion is soon
   labelled the first martyr, Manion the Innocent. Vorian, learning about
   the murder and realizing the lie he lives as a machine trustee, betrays
   his machine masters and flees with Serena. They are joined by another
   trustee, Iblis Ginjo, a slave leader who masterminds the rebellion on
   Synchronized Earth.

   The first human victory of the so-called Butlerian Jihad is the
   destruction of Earth and the Earth Omnius using atomics. Iblis (now
   Grand Patriarch of the Holy Jihad) and Serena (Priestess of the Jihad)
   are the religious leaders of the human rebellion, and Xavier and Vorian
   its two generals. The brutal Titans are desperate to break free of
   their machine masters and wage their own techno-misanthropic war, and
   Omnius and Erasmus are determined to conquer and destroy all of
   humanity once and for all.

   A subplot of the novel focuses on the Zensunni slave Ishmael who is
   captured by slavers and taken to Poitrin. He and a Zenshiite slave
   named Aliid attempt to sabotage one of Holtzmann's experiments. The two
   are influenced by the charismatic slave leader Bel Moulay, who inspires
   a slave uprising. Lord Nikto Bludd's Dragoon's suppress the revolt.
   While the slaves receive an amnesty due to the pressing war with
   Omnius, Moulay is mutilated and executed.

   And on a lonely desert planet known as Arrakis, the seeds of legend are
   sown with Selim Wormrider, an outcast from his tribe, who sees the
   future of Shai-Hulud and makes it his mission to save his god from
   those who would wish to take the spice.
