   Ben Mears, a writer who spent part of his childhood in Jerusalem's Lot,
   Maine, has returned in 1975 after 25 years to try to write his next
   novel. He quickly becomes friends with high school teacher Matt Burke
   and strikes up a romantic relationship with Susan Norton, a young
   college graduate with ambitions of leaving Jerusalem's Lot and heading
   to New York. Ben has returned to the town to write a book about the
   long-abandoned Marsten House, where he had a bad experience as a child
   when he saw a hanging ghost. Mears learns that the house--the former
   home of Depression-era hitman Hubert "Hubie" Marsten--has been
   purchased by Kurt Barlow, ostensibly an Austrian immigrant who has
   arrived in the Lot to open an antique furniture store. Barlow is
   supposedly on an extended buying trip; only his business partner,
   Richard Straker, is seen in public. The truth, however, is that Barlow
   is an ancient vampire, and Straker is his human familiar.

   The duo's arrival coincides with the disappearance of a young boy,
   Ralphie Glick, and the death of his 12-year-old brother, Danny, who
   becomes the town's first vampire turned by Barlow. Barlow also turns
   town dump custodian Dud Rogers and telephone repairman Corey Bryant.
   Danny turns other locals into vampires, including the graveyard digger,
   Mike Ryerson; a newborn baby, Randy McDougall; a man named Jack
   Griffen; and Danny's mother, Marjorie. Danny fails to turn his
   classmate Mark Petrie, who resists him by holding a plastic cross in
   Danny's face.

   Within several days, many of the townspeople are turned. To fight the
   spread of the new vampires, Ben and Susan are joined by Matt and his
   doctor, Jimmy Cody, along with Mark and the local priest, Father
   Callahan. Susan is captured by Barlow, who turns her. She is eventually
   staked through the heart by Ben.

   When Father Callahan and Mark go to Mark's parents' house to explain
   the danger that the family is in, the power is suddenly cut off, and
   Barlow appears. After killing Mark's parents, Barlow takes the boy
   hostage. Callahan pulls out his cross in an attempt to drive him off,
   and it works until Barlow challenges him to throw the cross away.
   Callahan, not having faith enough to do so, is soon overwhelmed by
   Barlow, who forces Callahan to drink his blood, making him "unclean".
   When Callahan tries to re-enter his church, he receives an electric
   shock, preventing him from going inside. Callahan leaves Jerusalem's
   Lot.

   Matt suffers a fatal heart attack, while Jimmy is killed when he falls
   from a rigged staircase and is impaled by knives set up by the
   vampires. Ben and Mark destroy Barlow, but are lucky to escape with
   their lives and are forced to leave the town to the now-leaderless
   vampires, and they managed to retrieve Jimmy's corpse before departing
   to a safe place to bury it. The novel's prologue, which is set shortly
   after the end of the story proper, describes Ben and Mark's flight
   across the country to a seaside town in Mexico, where they attempt to
   recover from their ordeal. Mark is received into the Catholic Church by
   a friendly local priest and confesses for the first time what they have
   experienced. The epilogue has the two returning to the town a year
   later, intending to renew the battle. Ben, knowing that there are too
   many hiding places for the vampires, starts a brush fire in the nearby
   woods with the intent of destroying the town.
