   Leo Proudhammer, an African-American actor who grew up in Harlem and
   later moved into Greenwich Village, has a heart attack while on stage.
   This event creates the present tense setting for the novel, which is
   mostly narrated in retrospect, explaining each relationship with a
   story from the actor's life.

   Barbara, a white woman, and Leo, a black man, are artistic partners for
   life--sometimes sexual partners, sometimes not. Jerry, their white
   friend, was Barbara's partner for a while, before Barbara revealed her
   love for Leo. Their life stories are intertwined, but not joined, due
   both to the racial pressures of society and Leo's bisexuality. One of
   Leo's lovers, "Black Christopher", is a significant political and
   emotional figure in the novel. Christopher's friends are all
   African-American, and his life centers on the struggle for racial
   justice. Barbara and Christopher have one sexual encounter, but, like
   much of the sex in the book, it is exploratory, and only significant
   for what it reveals to each of them.

   Barbara, Leo, and Christopher remain friends throughout the novel.
   Caleb, Leo's brother, a World War II vet, was falsely imprisoned when
   he is a young man, and eventually conquers his anger at white society
   through his conversion to fundamentalist Christianity. He judges Leo
   harshly for choosing "the world" over "the kingdom of God". Caleb's
   religion painfully isolates him from Leo. Black Christopher, the foil
   for Caleb, advocates violent revolution as the means for creating a
   just society. Leo recovers from his heart attack and returns to the
   stage at the end of the novel.
