   The Earth is passing through the tail of a comet, an event which has
   not occurred in 65 million years and coincided with the extinction
   event that wiped out the dinosaurs. On the night of the comet's
   passage, which takes place eleven days before Christmas, large crowds
   gather outside to watch and celebrate.

   18-year-old Regina "Reggie" Belmont works at a movie theater in
   southern California. She is annoyed to find the initials DMK have the
   sixth highest score on the theater's Tempest video game, on which all
   the other scores are hers. She stays after the theater closes to assist
   her boyfriend Larry, the theatre's projectionist to sneak back in so he
   can loan out a film reel for illegal duplication for his own profit. He
   offers to pay for her assistance from what he expects to earn when the
   other party returns the film reel in the morning. Reggie and Larry
   spend the night in the steel-lined projection booth and have sex.

   Meanwhile, Reggie's 16-year-old sister Samantha "Sam" argues with their
   stepmother Doris, who Sam implies is cheating on her father. It is
   revealed during the argument that Sam and Reggie's father is away on
   active military duty. Doris, upset by Sam's accusation, slaps her in
   the face. Sam retaliates and slaps Doris back. Doris then punches Sam
   in the face, sending her flying over the couch and onto the floor. Sam
   ultimately spends the night in a steel backyard shed.

   The next morning, a gloomy reddish haze covers the sky, and there are
   no signs of life but piles of red dust and heaps of clothing
   everywhere. Unaware that anything has occurred, Larry goes outside and
   is killed by a zombie wielding a pipe wrench. After playing the video
   game to replace DMK's initials with her own, Reggie goes looking for
   Larry outside, mistaking the red overcast sky as bad smog. She quickly
   encounters the zombie, but escapes on Larry's motorcycle. She heads
   home to find her sister, and they surmise that because they both spent
   the night in steel containers, they were saved from the comet's
   effects.

   The sisters race to the local radio station after they hear a disc
   jockey on air, only to find it was a pre-recorded show. They come
   across another survivor there, Hector Gomez, who spent the night in the
   back of his steel truck. When Sam talks into the microphone, she is
   heard by researchers in an underground installation out in the desert.
   As they listen to Reggie, Sam and Hector debate what to do, the
   scientists note that the zombies, though less exposed to the comet,
   will eventually disintegrate into dust themselves. Hector leaves to
   check if any of his family survived, but promises to return as soon as
   possible.

   Reggie and Sam then go shopping for guns and clothing at a mall. After
   a firefight with some evil stock boys, the girls are taken prisoner,
   but are saved by a rescue team sent by the scientists. Reggie is taken
   back to their base. Audrey White, a disillusioned scientist, offers to
   dispose of Sam, whom she diagnosed as having been exposed to the comet
   due to her developing rash, and to wait for Hector to return. After she
   fakes euthanizing Sam by injecting her with only a sedative, she kills
   the other remaining scientist. When Hector returns after an encounter
   with a zombie child, Audrey briefs him on the situation and then gives
   herself a lethal injection. Sam and Hector set out to rescue Reggie.

   Back at the base, it is revealed that the researchers had suspected and
   prepared for the comet's effects, but inadvertently left the
   ventilation system open and the fans running during the comet's
   passage. This allowed the deadly dust to permeate their base. Reggie,
   who has become suspicious, escapes and discovers that the dying
   scientists have hunted down and rendered healthy survivors brain-dead.
   They harvest their untainted blood to keep the disease at bay while
   they desperately search for a cure. Reggie saves a young boy and a girl
   before they are processed, then unplugs the other victims from their
   life support machines. Sam and Hector arrive and rescue the trio and
   blow up the scientists.

   Eventually, rain washes away the red dust, leaving the sky clear. After
   Reggie pairs up with Hector, and takes parental roles with the kids,
   Sam feels left out. Frustrated, she ignores Reggie's warning about
   crossing a deserted downtown street against the still-operating signal
   light, claiming there isn't anyone else left. Sam is almost run over by
   a sports car driven by Danny Mason Keener, a survivor about her own
   age. After apologizing, he invites her to go for a ride. As they drive
   off, the car is shown sporting the initials "DMK" on the vanity plate.
