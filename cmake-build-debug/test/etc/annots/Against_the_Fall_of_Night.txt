   Diaspar is the last human city, hundreds of millions of years old.
   Alvin, born seventeen years ago, is the first child to be born in 7,000
   years and lives among ancient immortals with unchanging lives. The
   Earth he knows lies in ruin, a vast desert, after a cataclysmic war
   with the Invaders millions of years ago confined mankind to the planet.
   He is fascinated by the world and its history, which his tutor Jeserac
   finds disturbing, the fear of doing anything that might trigger a
   return of the Invaders remains palpable. Bored, Alvin explores the
   empty sections of the city, and on one such trip, finds stairs leading
   to the desert outside. He begins to walk down them but is stopped by a
   large stone inscribed with the words "There is a better way. Give my
   greetings to the Keeper of the Records. - Alaine of Lyndar".

   Alvin takes the message to Rorden, the current Keeper of the Records,
   who has access to "all the knowledge of Humanity" in the city's
   databases. Rorden finds a message from Alaine but it simply states
   there are three ways to leave. Three years later, Rorden tells Alvin
   that he has deciphered Alaine's message, and takes him to a park in the
   center of Diaspar. There lies a monument to Yarlan Zey, designer of the
   park, which Rorden realizes was built to conceal some sort of
   transport. Rorden triggers a hidden elevator that takes them to an
   underground train station. A large map on the floor shows Diaspar as a
   brightly lit dot among many dimmed destinations, but one other dot
   remains lit, "Lys".

   After three days of preparation, Alvin steps into a waiting train car.
   Expecting an abandoned city, Alvin is shocked when he finds a thriving
   garden-like environment including a lake. He is taken to meet Seranis,
   leader of the local town of Airlee. She explains that Diaspar and Lys
   are two extremes of civilization, the ultimate end of those who
   preferred city or country. The inhabitants of Lys are different from
   his own people, living short but full lives and having telepathic
   abilities. Alvin is prevented from going home as the citizens do not
   want him to reveal Lys to the people of Diaspar. They contact Rorden
   and tell him that Alvin will stay five days to allow the council of Lys
   time to decide his fate.

   Alvin befriends Theon, Seranis' son, who takes Alvin camping. That
   night they see a bright light that Theon realizes comes from the
   ancient fortress of Shalmirane. Even Alvin has heard of Shalmirane; it
   is where mankind made its last stand against the Invaders. They decide
   to continue their hike and visit the fortress. At Shalmirane they find
   an old man who tells them his story; he was a follower of the Master,
   who came from space during the recovery following the invasion,
   attracting followers with his powers and machines. When he was dying,
   the Master spoke of the "Great Ones" returning, and his last words
   suggest he had lived on a planet around the Seven Suns, a wheel of
   multi-colored stars. The old man is the last remaining follower,
   sending signals into space to attract the Great Ones. He also controls
   the Master's machines, three advanced intelligent robots, but the
   Master instructed them to keep secrets. Alvin convinces the man to lend
   him one of the robots so he can take it to Rorden, promising to return
   it.

   The boys return to Lys, and Alvin is given the choice of staying in Lys
   forever or returning to Diaspar without his memories. Alvin agrees to
   the mind wipe but programs the robot to grab him and take him to the
   transit station before this occurs. He returns home, and Rorden takes
   Alvin and the robot under the city to meet the Master Robots, the
   computers that run the city. They are unable to remove the instructions
   from the Master, so they instead make a duplicate robot without the
   instructions in place. When they return to the surface, they find the
   Council has met in their absence and is trying to decide what to do
   about Alvin's visit to Lys. They decide to block the underground train
   system and instruct Rorden to remove all references to Lys from his
   records. As the Council debates, they allow Alvin to leave, expecting,
   and allowing, him to run for the train and return to Lys before it is
   blocked.

   Rorden is surprised when he finds a message from Alvin instructing him
   to meet at the tower where he first found the message from Alaine.
   Alvin explains that the new robot had revealed that the Master had
   landed on Earth not at Lys, but at the Port of Disaspar. He retrieves
   the ship from beneath the sand and flies to Lys where he learns they
   have also blocked the train, and sows confusion by claiming he used it
   without problem. He causes further confusion by stating that Diaspar
   now knows all about Lys but will have nothing to do with their inferior
   culture. The next day he and Theon fly to Shalmirane to fulfill his
   promise to return the robot, but find the old man had died.

   Alvin and Theon decide to visit the Seven Suns. They arrive at a planet
   around the middle star and find it as desolate as Earth. Despairing
   that his search for meaning has failed, they return to the ship and are
   met by a disembodied superintelligence with the behavior of a child but
   memories going back further than any human. The alien, Vanamonde, is
   convinced that Alvin is a member of the race of creators it has been
   waiting to return. They return to Earth to find Diaspar and Lys in
   constant communication over the events due to the fears their trip will
   trigger the Invaders to return. Rorden is a voice of calm, he has been
   researching the topic and can find no mention of the Invaders or any
   sort of treaty in the data banks.

   Alvin flies Rorden and Jeserac to Lys so they can add to the effort to
   understand Vanamonde. Over a period of months, they learn that their
   history is false. Man had only reached Persephone when aliens arrived,
   minds so much greater than their own that they returned to Earth and
   spent millions of years improving. When they were ready to join the
   galactic empire, they worked on projects like the Seven Suns, an
   artwork marking the agreed-on center of the galaxy. It was mankind that
   suggested the next great galactic effort, the construction of a
   non-physical pure intellect. This produced the Mad Mind, destroying
   swaths of the galaxy before it is locked up in the Black Sun. Learning
   from their mistakes, Vanamonde is created.

   Around the same time, the galactic empire contacts another race "far
   around the curve of the Cosmos" that has developed its own
   superintellect, one along purely physical lines. Most of the galaxy
   leaves on a quest to meet them, powering their great ship using the
   energy of all the suns, leaving the galaxy permanently dimmed. Only the
   Seven Suns remain untouched. Those that stayed behind were not
   adventurous and slowly went extinct over time, Earth only avoiding that
   fate by luck. Even the Battle of Shalmirane is a myth; Shalmirane was
   built to destroy the Moon when it threatened to crash into Earth.

   The book ends with the Tomb of Yarlan Zey being torn down as the links
   between Lys and Diaspar are opened to all. Alvin sets himself to
   rebuilding the Earth's oceans and solving the mystery of who the Master
   was. He intends to send the spaceship off on its own to bring a message
   to their now distant ancestors, hoping Earth will be worthy of their
   companionship when they return in the far distant future.
