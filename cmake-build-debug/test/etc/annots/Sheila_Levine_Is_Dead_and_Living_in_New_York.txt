   Painfully shy Sheila Levine relocates from Pennsylvania to New York
   City against the wishes of her parents who want her to get married.
   Sheila moves in with Kate, a sexy, extroverted aspiring actress with a
   busy social life. At Kate's suggestion, Sheila visits a nightclub,
   where she meets Sam, a bachelor doctor who persuades the naive Sheila
   to spend the night with him. Sheila has the first good sex of her life
   with Sam, but when she expresses romantic feelings for him, he lets her
   know he considers their encounter just a one-night stand, "satisfying
   an urge". Sheila leaves his apartment upset, saying she never wants to
   see him again.

   Some time later, Sheila and Sam meet again when he arrives at her
   apartment to take Kate on a blind date. Sheila and Sam find they are
   still attracted to each other, but when Kate appears, she easily lures
   Sam's attention away from Sheila. To Sheila's chagrin, Kate and Sam
   begin a steady relationship. When Sheila's younger sister marries,
   Sheila moves back to her parents' home in Pennsylvania, planning to
   stay, but she quickly realizes she no longer fits in there and misses
   Sam, who by now is living with Kate. Sheila returns to New York City
   and tries to win Sam back, only to find that Sam and Kate are engaged
   and that Kate is pregnant. Kate later tells Sheila that Sam is only
   marrying her because he thinks the baby is his, but it is actually
   another man's child, and Kate plans to have a secret abortion after she
   and Sam are married. Sheila remains in New York and concentrates on her
   new career as a producer of children's records. Sam eventually faces
   the fact that he loves Sheila, not Kate, and he and Kate break up. Sam
   proposes to Sheila; the film ends before she gives him her answer.
