   Kyreol, growing up in the simple community of Turtle-Crossing as
   daughter of the Healer, is unhappy with her life there and full of
   questions no one can satisfactorily answer. She wants to know where her
   long-lost mother disappeared to, and why lies beyond the edge of the
   world. Her dissatisfaction comes to a head with the Moon-flash ceremony
   betrothing her to the unimaginative Korre, and the appearance in her
   dreams of the strange and powerful Hunter.

   Kyreol decides she must leave home, following the River into the
   unknown beyond the rapids of Fourteen Falls. Accompanying her is her
   childhood friend Terje. On their journey they learn of other peoples
   and cultures, increasingly sophisticated, and other uses of the
   moon-flash symbol. Their quest culminates at the great Dome, holding
   the key to the Riverworld's mysteries and the road to the stars.
