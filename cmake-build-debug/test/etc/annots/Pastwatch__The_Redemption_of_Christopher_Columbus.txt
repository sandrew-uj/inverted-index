   Sometime in the future, humanity invents a series of machines which
   allow them to view events in their past. Tagiri is a researcher at
   Pastwatch, the organization in charge of these machines. Her special
   interest is in the colonization of the Caribbean and the life of
   Christopher Columbus. One day she accidentally discovers that the
   machines may be used to send information backwards in time. Unsure
   about what to do with this knowledge she is nonetheless put in charge
   of a project to explore it along with her husband Hassan. They are
   eventually joined by their daughter Diko.

   A parallel narrative tells of Columbus' efforts to secure financial and
   political backing for his voyage across the Atlantic. Tagiri and other
   researchers note that Columbus had always yearned for greatness but
   that as a young man he had been determined to head east in a new
   Crusade to liberate from the Muslims the Holy Land as well as
   Constantinople, whose fall was a recent and painful event to Europeans
   of Columbus' generation. Columbus only changed his mind and decided to
   head west across the Atlantic after nearly drowning in a storm.

   The mystery of exactly why Columbus changed his mind is solved by Diko.
   She uses a new, and more visually sensitive, version of the time viewer
   and discovers that after surviving the wreck Columbus received a vision
   directing him to head west to convert the people who lived on a
   previous undiscovered continent. The researchers realize that this
   vision is actually a hologram sent back in time by people from an
   alternate timeline in order to influence the direction of Columbus'
   life.

   Realizing that someone has already changed the timeline they try to
   figure out what might have been different if Columbus had headed east
   instead of west. The answer is provided by Hunahpu, an Amerindian
   researcher with Pastwatch. He argues that in the original timeline, the
   Europeans exhausted themselves in the anti-Muslim crusade propagated by
   Columbus, and meanwhile across the ocean the Tlaxcalan Empire of
   Central America grew powerful enough to invade the weakened Europe,
   subjecting the continent to a harsh regime of human sacrifice.
   Eventually, the Tlaxcalans underwent an Industrial Revolution and
   developed advanced weapons which enabled them to conquer the entire
   world - still without changing their bloodthirsty religion. In order to
   undo that atrocity, the Pastwatch's counterparts from the original
   timeline sent the hologram back to direct Columbus, the greatest man of
   his era, to head west. The European conquest of the Americas thereby
   neutralized the threat - but at the price of untold suffering for the
   Native Americans, trampled under the European conquest.

   Tagiri and her team determine that they must change history so that
   neither timeline happens as it did. The urgency of doing so increases
   when Tagiri's world goes into an ecological disaster of untold
   proportions, which threatens the very survival of humanity. Tagiri and
   the others reason that the ruthless plundering of the world's resources
   which led to the disaster was a continuation of the dynamic of ruthless
   European conquest of the Americas, and averting the one might avert the
   other as well. In any case, with the world on the brink of total
   disaster, there is little to lose in interfering with history and
   trying to change and improve it.

   Tagiri's team use their machinery to send Diko, Hunahpu, and a Turkish
   researcher named Kemal, back in time in order to change history.
   Hunahpu and Diko appear years before Columbus' voyage in Central
   America and the Caribbean respectively. They use genetically-engineered
   viruses to spread immunity to Old World diseases and work to strengthen
   Indian society for the coming European contact, including by spreading
   a pseudo-Christian religion among them and outlawing human sacrifice.
   Hunahpu helps accelerate the development of a Central American empire
   to rival European powers. When Columbus arrives, Kemal sinks his ships,
   stranding the explorer and his men in the Caribbean. After overcoming
   prejudice, Columbus learns to live with the indigenous people and
   becomes a powerful political leader among the natives of the Caribbean
   and eventually oversees a political union with the Central American
   empire.

   Diko becomes Columbus' lover and the two establish a strong, lasting
   loving relationship. After years of their knowing and trusting each
   other, Diko reveals to Columbus the truth about her origins and what
   she had done. When hearing about how his voyage of discovery would have
   led to the widespread killing and enslavement of the Indians, Columbus
   bursts out crying and thanks Diko for saving him from perpetrating such
   deeds.

   By the sixteenth century, the people of Central America and the
   Caribbean are able to send ships across the Atlantic to meet the
   Europeans on more equal footing. Neither Europeans nor Native Americans
   are in a position to conquer the other, and they embark on reasonably
   peaceful relations.

   A postscript describes the future of this new timeline as a utopian one
   and how archeologists in the 1950s discovered the skull of Kemal and
   found within it a set of small metal plates which contained a message
   from Tagiri and the Pastwatch program.
