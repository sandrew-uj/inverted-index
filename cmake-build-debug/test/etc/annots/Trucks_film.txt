   In a small Nevada town, the town residents live peacefully. But one
   day, most trucks mysteriously start to come to life and develop their
   own minds.

   Ray along with his son arrive in Nevada, where they decide to stay in a
   restaurant. As the trucks start to develop their own minds, a trucker
   loses control of his refrigerator truck and decides to get out of it to
   see why the truck stopped. When he decides to check the trailer, he is
   locked inside by the truck.

   Ray meets a Hippie named Jack and a woman named Hope and a man with his
   daughter. They see an old truck and decide to move it out of the way
   when the refrigerator truck comes and tries to kill them, but they
   escape.

   The group hides in a restaurant where more trucks come and circle
   around.

   Two hazmat workers are sent to clean up a chemical spill caused by a
   chemical truck that crashes into an electric substation, but are killed
   by their truck. Meanwhile, the group has a plan to fuel up the trucks
   to calm them down. When the night comes, they decide to fuel the trucks
   but Ray, his son, and Hope decide to secretly escape. A cook named
   George tries to shoot the trucks but is killed when the refrigerator
   truck runs him over and collides with the restaurant, causing the truck
   to explode.

   A few hours later Ray, his son, and Hope see a helicopter in the
   distance and decide to get inside when the refrigerator truck tries to
   kill them again but falls in a lake. The group manages to successfully
   get in the helicopter only to realize that there is no pilot inside.
