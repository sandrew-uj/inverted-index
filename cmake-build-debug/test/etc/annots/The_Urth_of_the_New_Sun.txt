   Unlike The Book of the New Sun, The Urth of the New Sun mostly takes
   place outside Urth. The book is yet again a continuation of Severian's
   narration of the aftermath of his ascent to the throne and subsequent
   journey "between the suns" to be judged and win back the fountain of
   life that will rejuvenate the slowly dying sun and revive life on Urth.
   When the book begins, Severian has already rewritten his accounts of
   before and is beginning his new log aboard the spaceship that will take
   him to Yesod, an enigmatic planet, home to the godlike beings who have
   the power to grant Urth and its sun a new lease on life.

   Aboard the ship, Severian meets Zak, a mysterious being, who begins
   small and soon develops human form and turns out to be the all-powerful
   Tzadkiel of Yesod. Once in Yesod, Severian faces an immense task of
   facing all the deceased people he has encountered since his childhood,
   including Thecla and Master Malrubius. When he faces the tribunal to be
   judged by Tzadkiel, he is told that the trial was already successfully
   passed. Severian is made the New Sun.

   After his return to Urth from Yesod, he finds the sun still dying, and
   that the New Sun is still very far, far away, but nevertheless moving
   relentlessly. He learns that many years have passed backwards. He also
   learns that he possesses healing power that he once attributed the Claw
   of the Conciliator and is taken as a prisoner into the Citadel, where
   he tells a story to his followers to comfort them. A prisoner in the
   next cell writes it down as The Book of the New Sun, the holy text of
   the Church of the Conciliator. He encounters the first Autarch Ymar and
   an earlier version of Typhon, who attempts to kill him. He manages to
   escape via the Corridors of Time. There, with the aid of a version of
   Tzadkiel, he travels back to the future. In his palace he finds his
   wife Valeria sitting on the throne attended by his old rival Baldanders
   (who has grown enough to match the size of an undine). Shortly after
   Severian reveals himself, an apocalyptic flood washes away the citadel
   and much of the land of Urth, thus bringing destruction and rebirth.

   Severian travels as far into past as he can and a primitive tribe
   accepts him as their divine king Apu-Punchau. After teaching and
   helping them for decades, he finally decides to leave, but is then
   killed by the tribe in their panic. He wakes inside a tomb and is once
   again accompanied by the Hierodules Ossipago, Barbatus and Famulimus,
   as well as the dead body of Apu-Punchau. It is revealed that Severian
   is an eidolon, a ghost-like being become material, and that he actually
   died on Tzadkiel's ship.

   Once more, now with the help of the Green Man, Severian flees through
   the Corridors of Time. Urth, now called Ushas, has recovered from the
   flood. A priest recognizes Severian as the Sleeper, one of their gods,
   and then leads him to where the other gods sleep as the novel ends.
