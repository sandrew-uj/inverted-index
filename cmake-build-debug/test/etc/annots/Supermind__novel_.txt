   As with many van Vogt works, the novel uses a psychological element, in
   this case Intelligence Quotient or IQ. The novel shows various alien
   races whose social roles within the galaxy are based upon their IQ. The
   story also includes the concept that at certain IQ levels various
   effects become manifest. For instance, at IQs in the thousands,
   individuals gain complete control over their body, allowing them to
   move at extreme speeds.

   The book has three distinct sections, corresponding to the three
   original stories.

   In the first section, two fugitive members of the Dreegh race arrive on
   Earth. They are vampires and set up an underground base where they plan
   to call on the other Dreegh to invade Earth and use humanity as food.
   The two are concerned that a famous doctor living on Europa, Ungard, is
   actually a member of the galactic civilization that is tasked with
   protecting lesser races like humanity. Using their mental powers, they
   take control of a reporter, Bill Leigh, and send him to track down the
   doctor and his daughter. During the mission, Leigh "awakes" to find he
   is actually a member of the Great Galactics, a race formerly believed
   to have left the material realm. He easily kills the Dreegh.

   In the second section, another Dreegh arrives at Europa and takes the
   Ungards hostage, along with Hanardy, the captain of a freighter that
   makes the Earth-Europa run. Several other Dreegh arrive and they begin
   harvesting blood from the Europan public. Hanardy also turns out to be
   a supermind, this time a human boosted by Research Alpha. Using his
   mental powers, he propels the Dreegh thousands of light-years into
   space.

   The third section takes place at Research Alpha, where one of the
   researchers is experimenting with a serum to rewrite human genetic code
   to create superminds. It follows a secretary as she undergoes two
   treatments, eventually reaching IQ 10,000 and gaining omniscience. The
   scientists at Research Alpha, members of the galactic civilization,
   become concerned with her power as it now outstrips their own. She is
   lured back to the lab where she is told her role is to marry Bill Leigh
   and recreate the Great Galactics.
