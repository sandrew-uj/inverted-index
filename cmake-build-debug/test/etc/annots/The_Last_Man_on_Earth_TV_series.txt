   Almost a year after a deadly virus sweeps the world, Phil Miller (Will
   Forte) is seemingly the only human survivor in late 2020. As he
   searches for others and paints signs in every state saying he is alive
   in his hometown of Tucson, Arizona, he finds no one. After years of
   being alone, he decides to run his truck into a rock to commit suicide.
   He happens to look off to the side right before he hits and sees smoke;
   he ends up discovering another survivor, Carol Pilbasian (Kristen
   Schaal). Despite being annoyed by each other, Carol believes it is
   their job as the last two survivors to repopulate the world but insists
   Phil marry her so their children will not be born out of wedlock.
   Although Phil thinks that it is ridiculous to hang on to traditions
   from the "old world", they marry for re-population purposes. Over the
   next several months, more survivors join them. When Phil's irritating
   attitude leads to his banishment from Tucson, Carol leaves with him.

   In season 2, Phil and Carol continue their road trip in the middle of
   2023. They discover the group has relocated to Malibu, California
   and travel there to reunite with them and rebuild trust. Meanwhile,
   Phil's astronaut brother Mike Miller (Jason Sudeikis) crashes down to
   Earth and finds his way to Malibu, where he joins the survivors briefly
   before getting sick and is ostracized by most of the group for
   seemingly having been infected with the virus.

   In season 3, following a potential threat by a paranoid and violent
   survivor Pat Brown (Mark Boone Junior), the other survivors move to a
   self-sustaining office building in San Jose, California, where Melissa
   (January Jones) struggles with mental instability and Carol discovers a
   young boy living in the woods whom they name Jasper. As time passes,
   Erica (Cleopatra Coleman) gives birth to a girl named Dawn, and the
   group decides to leave the United States for Mexico after seeing a
   nuclear facility meltdown close to the office.

   In season 4, Pamela Brinton (Kristen Wiig), a rich woman living in a
   bunker, discovers the group via a drone. The group ends up on a boat
   and first meet Pamela after she kills Pat. Pamela kidnaps Tandy while
   the other survivors end up stranded on an island. Here they meet Glenn
   (Chris Elliott), who has been on the island before the virus broke out.
   Pamela's guilt over abandoning the group becomes too much and they sail
   back to the island. The survivors move to Zihuatanejo, Mexico and while
   there, Carol gives birth to twin daughters and becomes pregnant again a
   few weeks later; Erica becomes pregnant again with Todd's (Mel
   Rodriguez) first child; and Mike temporarily rejoins the group, having
   recovered from what was actually a weakened immune system, before
   leaving to search for a way to start his own family. During a hunt for
   the missing Jasper, Tandy and Todd end up meeting Karl (Fred Armisen)
   at a jail, who poses as a jailer but is in fact a cannibal. He
   terrifies them until they decide to kill him, before he kills one or
   all of them. However, he ends up finding a Rubik's Cube that, once
   solved, explodes. The main group then moves to Tapachula, only to be
   found and surrounded by dozens of underground survivors.

   Although the series was canceled, the plan for the subsequent season
   was to have both groups of survivors live together and gain one
   another's trust before the main characters ended up infecting and
   killing all of the others as carriers of the virus.
