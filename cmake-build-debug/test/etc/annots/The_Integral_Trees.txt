   The Integral Trees is a 1984 science fiction novel by American writer
   Larry Niven (first published as a serial in Analog in 1983). Like much
   of Niven's work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas
   torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. A sequel, The Smoke Ring,
   was published in 1987.
