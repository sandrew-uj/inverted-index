   The pilot episode of Not with a Bang begins with a spoof episode of the
   iconic BBC show Tomorrow's World, (which is also a nod to the opening
   titles of apocalyptic drama series Survivors) where Judith Hann is
   presenting a story on how scientists have apparently isolated the
   hormone that causes aging in humans. The chemical is then accidentally
   released from a vial and the effect spreads almost instantly,
   annihilating virtually all human life on Earth, turning people into
   little piles of an ash-like compound, before dissipating harmlessly.

   The show then follows the plight of the four human survivors - three
   male, one female - who survive due to various far-fetched reasons - for
   example being sealed in a sound-proof booth during a pub quiz when the
   agent strikes the vicinity. The four characters are united by chance
   about one year after the event, and set up a base of operations in a
   country cottage. They then spend the next six episodes looking for
   other survivors, adjusting to life after the end of the world, and
   deliberating over the repopulation of the human race.

   The show relies heavily on a small cast of esoteric characters,
   including: rugby league fanatic Colin; everyman Brian, who comes
   closest to being the group's leader; and Graham and Janet, a bland
   couple who struggle over the issue of having children. Conversation
   between Graham and Janet frequently features Graham's reluctance and
   Janet's determination to have children, as well as Graham's
   extraordinarily low sperm count.

   The pub name is never mentioned in the show, but the shots from the
   outside are of the White Hart in the village of Bouth in
   Cumbria.
