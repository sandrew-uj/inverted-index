   The Ealdwood Stories, also known as the Arafel Stories, are a
   collection of fantasy works by American writer C. J. Cherryh. The books
   are works of high fantasy based in part on Celtic mythology. Arafel, a
   main character, is a Daoine Sidhe, the highest of the Sidhe faery-folk.
   She dwells in the magical small forest of Ealdwood, from which the
   tales take their name.
