   In the 24th century, Captain Jean-Luc Picard awakens from a nightmare
   in which he relived his assimilation by the cybernetic Borg six years
   earlier. He is contacted by Admiral Hayes, who informs him of a new
   Borg threat against Earth. Picard's orders are for his ship,
   USS Enterprise, to patrol the Neutral Zone in case of Romulan
   aggression; Starfleet is worried that Picard is too emotionally
   involved with the Borg to join the fight.

   Learning the fleet is losing the battle, the Enterprise crew disobeys
   orders and heads for Earth, where a single Borg Cube ship holds its own
   against a group of Starfleet vessels. Enterprise arrives in time to
   assist the crew of USS Defiant and its captain, the Klingon Worf. With
   the flagship now supporting them, Picard takes control of the fleet and
   directs the surviving ships to concentrate their firepower on a
   seemingly unimportant point on the Borg ship. The Cube is destroyed
   but launches a smaller sphere ship towards the planet. Enterprise
   pursues the sphere into a temporal vortex. As the sphere disappears,
   Enterprise discovers Earth has been altered - it is now populated
   entirely by Borg. Realizing the Borg have used time travel to change
   the past, Enterprise follows the sphere through the vortex.

   Enterprise arrives hundreds of years in its past on April 4, 2063, the
   day before humanity's first encounter with alien life after Zefram
   Cochrane's historic warp drive flight some time after the Earth had
   been devastated by the nuclear holocaust of World War III; the crew
   realizes the Borg are trying to prevent first contact. After destroying
   the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Cochrane's ship,
   Phoenix, in Bozeman, Montana. Picard has Cochrane's assistant Lily
   Sloane sent back to Enterprise for medical attention. The captain
   returns to the ship and leaves Commander William T. Riker on Earth to
   make sure Phoenix's flight proceeds as planned. While in the future
   Cochrane is seen as a hero, the real man built the Phoenix for
   financial gain and is reluctant to be the heroic person the crew
   describes.

   A group of Borg invade Enterprise's lower decks and begin to assimilate
   its crew and modify the ship. Picard and a team attempt to reach
   engineering to disable the Borg with a corrosive gas, but are forced
   back; the android Data is captured in the melee. A frightened Sloane
   corners Picard with a weapon, but he gains her trust. The two escape
   the Borg-infested area of the ship by creating a diversion in the
   holodeck. Picard, Worf, and the ship's navigator, Lieutenant Hawk,
   travel outside the ship in space suits to stop the Borg from calling
   reinforcements by using the deflector dish, but Hawk is assimilated in
   the process. As the Borg continue to assimilate more decks, Worf
   suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls him a coward,
   infuriating Worf because of his Klingon heritage. Sloane confronts the
   captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally because of his
   own past with becoming Locutus of Borg. Picard orders an activation of
   the ship's self-destruct, then orders the crew to head for the escape
   pods while he stays behind to rescue Data.

   As Cochrane, Riker, and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate
   the warp drive on Phoenix, Picard discovers that the Borg Queen has
   grafted human skin onto Data, giving him the sensation of touch he has
   long desired so that she can obtain the android's encryption codes to
   the Enterprise computer.

   Although Picard offers himself to the Borg in exchange for Data's
   freedom and willingly become Locutus again, Data refuses to leave. He
   deactivates the self-destruct and fires torpedoes at Phoenix. At the
   last moment the torpedoes miss, and the Queen realizes Data betrayed
   her. The android ruptures a coolant tank, and the corrosive vapor
   eats away the biological components of the Borg. With the Borg threat
   neutralized, Cochrane completes his warp flight. The next day the
   crew watches from a distance as an alien Vulcan ship, attracted by the
   Phoenix warp test, lands on Earth. Cochrane and Sloane greet the
   aliens. Having ensured the correction of the timeline, the Enterprise
   crew slip away and return to the 24th century.
