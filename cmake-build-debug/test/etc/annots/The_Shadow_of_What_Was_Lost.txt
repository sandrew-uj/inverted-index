   Davian is a young man studying at Caladel, a school under the
   supervision of the Tol Athian council. Davian learns that he is
   actually an Augur. He is given a Vessel, an Augur artifact, and is told
   that the Boundary, an ancient border north of Andarra, is failing.
   Behind it lie monsters led by immortal Augur Aarkein Devaed. Devaed is
   planning an invasion of Andarra. Davian and his best friend Wirr
   escape. That night, almost every remaining resident is murdered. The
   only survivor is their friend Asha, another young Gifted. Asha becomes
   Tol Athian's Representative to the Northwarden Elocian Andras, brother
   of the king and leader of the Administrators. Elocian tells Asha that
   he is secretly rescuing Augurs and regrets the creation of the Tenets.

   Davian's Vessel, the Portal Stone, leads them to rescue a Gifted man
   named Caeden. Caeden has been accused of massacring an entire village,
   but has lost his memories. Davian is transported to the past. He meets
   a shapeshifting Augur named Malshash, who trains Davian to use Augur
   abilities before sending him back to his own time.

   The Northwarden's Augurs have a vision of Ilin Illan, the capital city,
   being overrun by invaders known as the Blind. Asha, Davian, and Wirr
   (who is actually Elocian's son) reunite in the city. Davian discovers
   that Devaed's master plan involves restoring Caeden's memories. Elocian
   is killed by the Blind; Wirr then changes the Tenets to allow the
   Gifted to fight.

   Caeden meets a man named Garadis, guardian of the sword Licanius. The
   sword may only be given to one who is not seeking it. Caeden has been
   trying to take the sword for centuries; he eventually erased his own
   memories and planned a pathway to lead him to Licanius. Caeden uses
   Licanius to kill the entire army of the Blind. Davian leaves Ilin Illan
   to join Tol Shen, where he will work with other Augurs to repair the
   Boundary. Caeden uses the Portal Stone to meet a man who can restore
   his memories. He requests to see the memory of the day he was accused
   of the village massacre, believing it will prove his innocence. He
   learns that he is guilty, and also that he is both Melshash and Aarkein
   Devaed. Caeden collapses in grief.
