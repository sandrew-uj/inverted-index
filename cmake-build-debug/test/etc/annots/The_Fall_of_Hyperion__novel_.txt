   Main article: Hyperion Cantos

   The Hegemony is an interstellar governmental entity formed by many
   planets, most of which are connected by instantaneous farcaster
   portals. Some worlds, like Hyperion, have no farcaster portals and are
   sparsely settled; they are known as the "Outback". The farcasters are
   created and managed by the TechnoCore, an AI civilization. While the
   Core's physical location is unknown, they interact with humans through
   various virtual realities.

   The Hegemony is opposed by the Ousters, genetically modified humans
   that fled the Hegemony's growing influence even before Earth was
   destroyed. The Ousters have mutated physically, believing that they
   should adapt to their outer-space surroundings rather than adapt the
   surroundings themselves. They have rarely fought full-scale conflicts
   with the Hegemony but are currently launching an invasion of Hyperion.
