   Professor Bullfinch develops the "House of the Future" in which all
   controls are automatic, and plans to debut it at an upcoming Science
   Fair. This includes temperature controls and other standard functions,
   but also items such as washing machines, food preparation and normal
   housework. Danny, Irene and Joe, as well as Irene's toddler cousin, go
   to explore the house and become trapped inside, as the locks were
   automated to have security settings to seal the house until the
   Professor's introduction. Danny and his friends learn that in addition
   to the automated locks, everything is only a fake sample and the
   windows cannot be broken. They are trapped inside with no food or
   telephone, and the Fair does not open for three days!
