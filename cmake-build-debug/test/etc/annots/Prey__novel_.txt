   The novel is narrated by the protagonist Jack Forman, an unemployed
   software programmer who used to work for a company called Media Tronics
   but was fired and blackballed for discovering an internal scandal. As a
   result, he is forced to take the role of a house husband while his wife
   Julia serves as a high ranking executive at a nanorobotics company
   called Xymos. Julia claims that she is working on a new piece of
   revolutionary imaging technology with her company, which takes up most
   of her time and makes her grow distant to Jack and her family. He
   starts believing that during her long hours away from home she is
   having an affair and becomes watchful of her changes.

   One night Julia comes home late and shows Jack a video of her
   demonstrating the Xymos nanobots. In the video, the nanobots are put
   into a human test subject, and video from inside the body is broadcast
   in real time. Jack is impressed but becomes more suspicious of her
   straying when he notices the video was not made on the same day as she
   said it was.

   Later in the night, their baby girl Amanda awakens in agony as her body
   turns red from an unknown cause. Jack takes her to the hospital, but
   the doctors cannot identify the cause of her pain. She is given an MRI
   for more examination, then suddenly her pain stops and the skin changes
   disappear. Bewildered and exhausted, Jack returns home to a strangely
   indifferent Julia who leaves in a hurry, claiming to go on an urgent
   business trip.

   Strange events happen that lead Jack to suspect something bigger is
   going on with Julia as their son Eric claims he saw "silver men"
   cleaning the house in the middle of the night, and Jack finds a strange
   device found underneath Amanda's bed that wasn't there before, memory
   chips on their son's MP3 player have turned to dust, Julia has not only
   become distant but has also become abusive to her family, and Julia was
   seen driving one night with an unidentifiable passenger in her car. On
   that same night, Julia is injured in a car crash, and Jack is recruited
   to consult at Xymos, because the project manager, Ricky - a good friend
   of Jack's and former colleague - is having software issues with the
   nanobots.

   Jack is taken to the Xymos research facility in Nevada's Basin Desert,
   where he is given a tour of the lab, meets the programming team, and is
   shown a complicated machine used to make the nanobot assemblers from
   bacteria. Ricky refuses to show Jack the source code for the nanobots,
   and later Ricky claims that building contractors failed to properly
   install filters in a certain vent in the building. As a result,
   hazardous elements such as the assemblers, the bacteria, and the
   nanobots were blown into the desert, evolving and eventually forming
   autonomous swarms. These swarms appear to be clouds of solar-powered
   and self-sufficient nanobots, reproducing and evolving (necroevolution)
   rapidly. The swarms exhibit predatory behavior, attacking and killing
   animals in the wild, using code that Jack himself worked on. Most
   alarmingly, the swarms seem to possess rudimentary intelligence, the
   ability to quickly learn and to innovate. Jack also learns that Julia
   helped teach the swarms to improve their intelligence and become more
   benign, but they regressed when she left. The swarms tend to wander
   around the plant during the day but quickly leave when strong winds
   blow or night falls.

   The nanoswarm kills a rabbit outside the complex, and Jack goes outside
   with Mae to inspect. They find that the rabbit died of suffocation
   resulting from the nanobots blocking its bronchial tubes. While Mae
   goes inside for equipment, Jack is attacked by the swarms. He barely
   manages to get through the airlock into the lab before falling
   unconscious from anaphylactic shock.

   Persuaded by Jack despite Ricky's protests, the team decides to destroy
   the swarm or else risk its reproducing exponentially and becoming a
   grey goo plague that could endanger humanity. They believe the swarm
   must have nested in the desert to reproduce. They attempt to find this
   nest by tagging the swarm with radioactive isotopes and following them
   back to their nest at night. Under the cover of a strong wind that
   forces the swarms to remain dormant, the team goes outside to a storage
   shack to find the isotopes and build a spray device. However, the wind
   dies down, and four swarms attack the shack and eventually kill David
   and Rosie. The rest of the team are forced to take shelter in the cars
   parked outside.

   The swarms find a way to enter the cars, but not long before the wind
   picks up in speed again. Jack and Mae manage to escape to the lab, but
   Charley falls unconscious outside his car after spraying his swarm with
   the isotope. Bobby, Vince, and Ricky refuse to go outside and help
   Charley. Jack, dizzy and nauseous, goes back out again to save Charley
   as the swarms attack again. Using a motorbike found in David's car,
   Jack manages to get himself and the semi-conscious Charley to the
   safety of the airlock before Jack falls unconscious again.

   As night falls, Jack, Mae, and Bobby set out to find the swarms. While
   searching for them, they discover that the swarms are moving the now
   deceased Rosie through the desert. The team is also shocked to discover
   that the swarms can replicate the physical features, perceptions, and
   motions of humans when they see the swarms form replicas of Ricky,
   David, and Rosie.

   The group follows the body to find the swarms nesting in a cave. As
   some of the Ricky-swarms come out of the cave after them, a Xymos
   helicopter arrives and wards off the swarms using its powerful draft.
   Mae and Jack then venture into the cave and proceed to exterminate the
   swarms, their nest, and their organic assembly plant (which looks very
   similar to the original Xymos assembly plant) using explosive thermite
   caps. They return to the Xymos plant, exhausted.

   At the plant, Jack, Mae, and Bobby are enthusiastically greeted by
   Julia, who had discharged herself from the hospital and was brought in
   by the chopper. Julia's behavior seems to be extremely aberrant; she
   seems to pay heed to nothing except trying to entice Jack and kissing
   him, even when Charley is found dead in the locked communications room
   with a swarm flying around him and the communication links cut. Jack
   cannot understand how the swarm got inside the rigorously protected
   airtight building, why Charley would have disabled the facility's
   communications, or why Julia and Ricky seem to be coming up with
   various out-of-character ways of how he died.

   Mae discovers security footage of when they were in the desert. To
   Jack's horror, the video not only reveals that Julia and Ricky had an
   affair but also shows how Charley engaged in a vicious fight with Ricky
   and Vince. All of them end up in the communications room where Julia
   kisses a subdued Charley, injecting a stream of swarm into his mouth
   while Ricky sabotages the communication systems, and they leave Charley
   to die from the swarm.

   Eventually, Jack and Mae realize that everyone in the facility except
   themselves have been infected by a symbiotic version of the nanobot
   swarms. These nanobots, although evolved alongside the other swarms, do
   not show aggressive predatory behavior. Instead, while they seem to
   invigorate their hosts' physical attributes and their emotional
   perceptions, the nanobots slowly devour and take over their hosts to
   produce more nanobots, and in the process affect their decision making
   and then the bots control them, while allowing them to travel and
   contaminate others.

   Jack comes up with a plan to destroy this new strain. Mae and Jack
   drink vials containing a form of phage that kills the nanobot-producing
   E. coli bacteria and thus would protect them from infection by the
   nanobots. Jack then proceeds to take a sample of the phage and pour it
   into the sprinkler system and drench everyone with it. He has Mae alert
   Julia and the infected team. They set out to stop Jack. In the vicious
   struggle that ensues, Jack is captured and thrown into a magnetic
   chamber, with Ricky threatening him to either reveal his plan or be
   killed by the magnets. Jack feigns surrender when Julia walks in to
   interrogate him, but Jack then reactivates the magnetic chamber with
   Julia inside, remembering the incident with Amanda in the MRI. Julia's
   body disintegrates as a swarm is pulled away by the magnetic field to
   temporarily reveal the real Julia, who has slowly been consumed by the
   parasitic swarm. Before the swarm can repossess her body, Julia begs
   Jack to forgive her for putting him in danger, says she loves him, and
   tells him to stop the swarms and save their children from the same
   fate, as they have been infected too. Motivated, Jack runs to the roof,
   fights off the infected team, and finally manages to place the sample
   into the sprinkler system.

   In order to prevent the sprinkler system from triggering,
   infected-Ricky disables the plant's safety network. However, this is
   exactly what Jack wants, as Mae has already allowed the phage into the
   assembly line, causing the phage to reproduce rapidly. The assembly
   line is rapidly overheating because of the de-activated safety system.
   If infected-Ricky and infected-Julia don't turn on the safety system
   the assembly line will burst, filling the lab with the phage. The
   infected-team, who are now doomed either way, choose to re-activate the
   safety network and get drenched with the phage. Jack and Mae escape the
   facility in a helicopter shortly before the facility explodes due to a
   methane gas leak combined with thermite Mae has placed in the building.

   After returning home, Jack doses his children and sister with the phage
   to eradicate the potential nanobot infestation. Mae calls the U.S. Army
   and sends a sample of the phage to her lab.

   Jack puts together all the missing links. The corrosion of the memory
   chips in his home's electronics and Amanda's skin rash were caused by
   nanobot assemblers spread by infected-Julia. The MRI's strong magnetic
   field detached the assemblers from Amanda. Knowing this, Julia called
   in the Xymos special team to scan Amanda's room. The person whom Jack
   spotted in Julia's car was in fact the Ricky-swarm. Xymos had
   intentionally released the swarm into the desert so that it would
   evolve to stay in a cohesive group in the wind, but then they called
   him in to destroy the wild strain once it became uncontrollable.
