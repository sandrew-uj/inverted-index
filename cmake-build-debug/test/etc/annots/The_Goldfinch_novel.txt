   The Goldfinch is told in retrospective first-person narration by
   Theodore "Theo" Decker. As a thirteen-year-old boy, Theo's life is
   turned upside down when he and his mother visit the Metropolitan Museum
   of Art to see an exhibition of Dutch masterpieces, including a favorite
   painting of hers, Carel Fabritius's The Goldfinch. There, he becomes
   intrigued by a red-headed girl with an elderly man. A bomb explodes in
   the museum, killing his mother and several other visitors.

   In the rubble, Theo encounters the old man who gives him a ring and
   delivers an enigmatic message before dying. Believing that the man is
   pointing at The Goldfinch, Theo takes it during his panicked escape. He
   moves in with a school friend, Andy Barbour, and his wealthy family in
   their Park Avenue apartment. He carries out the old man's last wishes
   and returns the ring to his business partner, James "Hobie" Hobart.
   Theo learns that the old man's name was Welton "Welty" Blackwell, and
   that he and Hobie ran an antiques shop together. He becomes friends
   with Hobie and encounters the red-haired girl, Pippa, who lived with
   Welty and Hobie after her mother (Welty's half-sister) died of cancer.

   Theo's life is disrupted when his deadbeat dad arrives with his new
   girlfriend and whisks him away to Las Vegas. He takes the painting with
   him, and in Las Vegas, makes a new friend, Boris Pavlikovsky, the
   cosmopolitan son of a Ukrainian emigre. The two boys, both with
   absentee parents, spend most of their afternoons drinking, smoking
   marijuana, and using other illegal drugs. While hounded by a
   loan-shark, Theo's father gets drunk and dies in a car crash. Fearful
   of what his father's death may mean to his living situation, Theo flees
   to New York via cross-country bus. With nowhere to stay, he heads to
   Hobie's, who welcomes him. Pippa, now enrolled in a school for troubled
   teens in Switzerland, is visiting on break.

   The narrative skips ahead eight years. Theo has become a full partner
   in Hobart's business. He has concealed The Goldfinch because he is
   afraid of being accused of theft. He is engaged to a childhood friend
   but is still confused and obsessed with this "love" for Pippa, who is
   living in London with her boyfriend. Over the years, he becomes
   addicted to prescription medication and saves Hobie from bankruptcy by
   selling fake antiques.

   Theo is racked by guilt and fear over the fakes and The Goldfinch.
   Boris reappears, now a wealthy man thanks to dubious unspecified
   activities. To Theo's astonishment, Boris reveals that he had stolen
   The Goldfinch from Theo while they were in high school; the painting
   has since been used as collateral by criminals and drug dealers. Boris
   feels guilty and has devoted himself to recovering the painting and
   returning it to Theo. At Theo's engagement party, Boris appears with a
   plan to retrieve The Goldfinch. They fly to Amsterdam to meet with the
   dealers who have the painting. Boris and his associates steal it back
   but the plan goes awry when armed henchmen confront them. In the
   resulting conflict, Boris is shot in the arm and Theo kills Boris's
   attacker while one of the dealers escapes with the painting.

   Boris disappears, leaving Theo in his hotel room, where he drinks,
   takes drugs, and recovers from illness, and is afraid that police will
   discover him. Unable to return to New York because Boris has his
   passport, Theo feels trapped and contemplates suicide. After several
   days, Boris returns and reveals that he has resolved the situation by
   phoning the art recovery police to inform on the dealers. Not only has
   the painting been saved for the museum, but Boris has received a huge
   reward, which he shares with Theo.

   After arriving in the United States, Theo travels the country, using
   the reward money to buy back the fake antiques from customers. He
   realizes that 'Pippa' does love him, but she would not openly
   reciprocate his feelings because she believes they share the same
   injury and flaws, both having survived the trauma of the museum
   explosion and both self-medicating to ease their psychological scars.
   In a lengthy reflection, Theo wonders how much of his experiences were
   unavoidable due to fate or his character, and contemplates The
   Goldfinch and "the history of people who have loved beautiful things,
   and looked out for them, and pulled them from the fire". The novel ends
   on a curious note, inasmuch as Theo's contemplation demonstrates both a
   hard fate still ahead and a sort of redeeming immortality through the
   admiration of beauty.
