   The book opens at an unknown period of time, where a child is locked in
   a dark room with an unseen figure (later revealed to be under a
   warehouse, near Saint Paul's Cathedral, by order of Matt from The
   Dead). The figure talks about how he "fell from the heavens" and landed
   in "the big green" where he "traveled" from insects to animals over
   thousands of years, eventually reaching humans. From this, it is
   possible to theorise that the figure is talking about the virus, which
   came to earth from space billions of years ago, landed in a jungle, and
   worked its way up the dominance chain until it was eventually able to
   infect a human subject (this is explained further in The Fallen). The
   figure then reveals himself to be a zombie capable of speech, before he
   devours the child.

   The actual story picks up eight days after Small Sam and The Kid arrive
   at the Tower of London at the end of The Dead/The Enemy, and after the
   events of The Fear. The two boys are constantly teased for their
   resemblance to the children on the Angus Day Banner, even though they
   both know nothing about Matt and his acolytes. Sam begins to grow
   restless of his confinement, wanting find the Holloway kids again so he
   can be with his younger sister Ella, who is traveling as one of the
   younger kids in their group. Jordan (still the Tower leader), is
   secretly beginning to slowly turn blind, and calls a council to discuss
   a punishment for Brendan, Jessica's ex-boyfriend who was caught
   stealing food from the group's supply cache. After forcing Brendan to
   confess, Jordan sentences him to death, resulting in Brendan attacking
   him until he is subdued.

   Before Kyle (a square-faced boy Ed befriended during The Dead) is about
   to execute Brendan, Jordan decides to reduce the punishment to exile in
   response to complaints by other Tower residents. Brendan is kicked out
   of the fortress and wanders off through the so-called "No Go Zone", the
   heart of Old London where the zombies are said to be unpredictable and
   extremely dangerous. In response to Sam's complaints about not being
   able to leave the tower and questions about the mockery the other Tower
   residents give him and the Kid, Ed tells them about Matt and his
   Acolytes, while also stating that they are keeping the two boys inside
   the tower for their own safety. Ed promises to put a party together and
   eventually take Sam to find Ella, which the two youngsters both agree
   to. Later whilst eating breakfast, some sentries spot a group of girls
   fleeing into a nearby pub after being chased by a horde of zombies. Ed
   and a few other kids, including Kyle, head to the pub and rescue a
   fourteen-year-old girl named Tish, who is strangely wearing all green
   clothes. Ed, however, in a moment of hesitation, accidentally kills the
   only other surviving member of Tish's group (also fully dressed in
   green).

   Tish is brought back to the Tower, and is put in the same bunk room as
   Sam and The Kid. She tricks the two boys into believing that Jordan and
   Ed have other motives, and want to imprison them both. She offers to
   take them across the city to find Ella, and they both agree with her.
   Sam does however have some doubts as to whether he is doing the right
   thing. The next morning, the trio start a small fire as a distraction,
   allowing them to escape. They head into the No Go Zone and are chased
   by a group of zombies and escape into the subway tunnels, which The Kid
   has a significant knowledge of. After navigating their way through the
   subway system, they are chased and cornered by more zombies, but are
   ultimately saved more kids, each wearing all green like Tish. She
   reveals that they are all part of her original group.

   At the tower, the trio's disappearance is noticed, and Ed decides to
   launch a search party in hopes of finding them consisting of himself,
   Kyle, two boys named Macca and Will, and two girls named Hayden and
   Adele. As they make their way through London, Kyle smashes open a
   zombie's skull, and the group fail to notice a mass of moving grey
   slime that emerges from its head. They eventually wind up at the Houses
   of Parliament with Nicola, who develops a minor and insignificant crush
   on Ed.

   Meanwhile, Shadowman has been tracking the Fear consistently through
   the city from days, and is learning more about their evolving
   organization. He learns that they have become more intelligent and have
   established a chain of command with St. George and his remaining three
   lieutenants at the top. While spying on the Fear, he spots a group of
   three kids who don't realize how large The Fear are. He tries to warn
   them, but they are attacked and surrounded. Two of the kids, Johnny and
   Jaz, manage to escape whilst the other one, Ricky, is eaten alive.
   Shadowman runs with the group to their car, but discovers the keys were
   left in Ricky's pocket. Shadowman returns to the Fear's hiding place
   and retrieves the keys from Ricky's body. He then returns to the group,
   and they drive away, but Jaz, angry, tries to run over the remaining
   zombies as they retreat, and winds up crashing the car and flipping it
   upside down. Shadowman passes out and is rescued by Jaz's friends, who
   take him to their headquarters, in an IKEA store. There, Shadowman
   meets the group's leader, Saif, and learns Jaz died of blood loss after
   a zombie ate her foot, although Johnny survived and is thankful to
   Shadowman for saving his life.

   Sam and The Kid are taken their rescuers to their home, which is
   revealed to be St. Paul's Cathedral. It is revealed that the building
   is inhabited by Matt (now known as Mad Matt) and his Acolytes, and that
   Tish and the boys' rescuers are all members of Mad Matt's cult. They
   found out about Sam and The Kid via Brendan (revealed to have survived
   the No-Go Zone and made it to the cathedral) and believe that the two
   boys are the "Lamb and Goat" on the Angus Day banner. After the boys
   are treated to a feast by the Acolytes, they befriend a girl their age
   named Charlotte, who reveals that Matt gained respect from the kids at
   the Cathedral via taking control of a warehouse next to them filled to
   the brim with food. Matt's group eventually reveal their true
   intentions- they plan to figure out which of the boys is the "Goat",
   and sacrifice them so the "Lamb" can cleanse the earth of the Nephilim
   (Matt's name for the zombies). After not being able to determine which
   of them is the Goat, Matt imprisons both boys. Eventually, the Kid
   tells Matt that he is the Goat, and is brutally whipped in an effort to
   get him to reveal his real name. The Kid initially refuses, until he
   lies and tells Matt his name is Angus Day. Matt believes this, and
   locks the Kid inside a cage, deciding to sacrifice him by having him
   fed to a zombie the people at the Cathedral call Wormwood (the figure
   from the start of the book). The Kid is locked in the same room as
   before, where he meets Wormwood, who is revealed to be a zombified
   father covered head to toe in mould (earning him the nickname "The
   Green Man"), with the ability to speak and communicate with other
   people. The Kid manages to convince Wormwood not to eat him, and they
   instead work together to find a passage in the back of the room,
   escaping through a tunnel into a nearby building.

   Ed and the rest of his group discover the boy's location, whilst the
   Cathedral comes under siege from a huge horde of zombies. They arrive
   at and fight their way into the building, where Ed rescues Sam and
   beats Matt into giving him the Kid's location. Matt takes them to the
   warehouse, where they find Wormwood's room empty. Matt believes The Kid
   and Wormwood have destroyed each other and rejoices, leading to Sam and
   Charlotte believing the Kid is dead. Ed's party, Sam, Charlotte and a
   few other members of Matt's group, run into an abandoned building to
   escape the continuing siege, and there find The Kid and Wormwood.
   Whilst Matt barricades himself inside the Cathedral with the rest of
   his followers, Wormwood helps Ed's group escape by somehow
   communicating telepathically with the zombies (also explained further
   in The Fallen). Brendan, Tish, and Adele die helping Ed's crew escape
   across the Wobbly Bridge. Ed decides to take Sam to The Natural History
   Museum, upon discovering that this is where Ella and the Holloway gang
   are currently located.

   Shadowman, meanwhile, watches the demise of most of Jaz's group from a
   high vantage point, due to an ill-advised attack on the Fear ordered by
   Saif. He goes down to try to help a kid he believes is still alive, but
   learns he is incorrect is attacked by one of Saint Georges Lieutenants,
   Bluetooth. He attempts to flee on a gimpy leg, but Bluetooth ultimately
   catches up with him. He is saved when he runs into Ed's crew; with
   their assistance, he kills every zombie chasing him, including
   Bluetooth himself. He takes Ed's gang to a safe hiding spot, where he
   decides to reveal his real name to Ed; Dylan Peake. Ed and Dylan swap
   notes on St George and his army, but agree that they will deal with the
   issue later.

   The book ends with Jordan declaring that he will clear the No Go Zone,
   after Hayden runs back to the Tower and informs him of Ed's trip
   through London. We read reflections from Nicola, David, Jordan, Ed, and
   St. George himself about how things are beginning to change. Ed and The
   Kid believe that Wormwood may be the key to stopping the entire
   apocalypse. It is made clear that Wormwood was a scientist studying
   parasitic rain forest diseases, and that he may be the first case ever
   of the virus' attacking a human. Wormwood repeats the phrase, "out with
   the bad blood, and in with the good", to The Kid.
