   The Mars trilogy is a series of science fiction novels by Kim Stanley
   Robinson that chronicles the settlement and terraforming of the planet
   Mars through the personal and detailed viewpoints of a wide variety of
   characters spanning almost two centuries. Ultimately more utopian than
   dystopian, the story focuses on egalitarian, sociological, and
   scientific advances made on Mars, while Earth suffers from
   overpopulation and ecological disaster.

   The three novels are Red Mars (1992), Green Mars (1993), and Blue Mars
   (1996). The Martians (1999) is a collection of short stories set in the
   same fictional universe. Red Mars won the BSFA Award in 1992 and Nebula
   Award for Best Novel in 1993. Green Mars won the Hugo Award for Best
   Novel and Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1994. Blue Mars
   also won the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1997.

   Icehenge (1984), Robinson's first novel about Mars, is not set in this
   universe but deals with similar themes and plot elements. The trilogy
   shares some similarities with Robinson's more recent novel 2312 (2012);
   for instance, the terraforming of Mars and the extreme longevity of the
   characters in both novels.
