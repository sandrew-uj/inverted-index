   In the nuclear-ravaged wasteland of Earth in the year 2087, water is as
   precious as life itself. The isolated town of Lost Wells, an outpost
   that survived the holocaust, is led by Ethan (Bruce Dern), a Moses-like
   guru and the last schoolteacher on the planet, Angie (Catherine
   Stewart). The inhabitants of the town guard the secret of their
   existence and source of their water from the outside world. The "town"
   consist of a Mobil station surrounded by a wall of old cars. The school
   takes place in an old school bus. One of the few books still in
   existence and held by the town is an unabridged book on etiquette by
   Emily Post.

   An evil cult of pseudoreligious renegades led by Derek (Adam Ant), a
   group following the teachings in a book on Charles Manson discovers the
   existence of the water source and wants control of the town's valuable
   water supply. As the villagers are no match for Derek's brute military
   force, they hire mercenaries living in a distant city. That group
   includes Nitro, Ten Watt and they are led by George Landon. The
   townspeople and the mercenaries team up to stage a last ditch defense
   of the town. "
