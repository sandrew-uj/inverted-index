   Jennifer, Hecate is narrated by the protagonist Elizabeth in the title.
   She has moved into a big apartment building in a town where almost
   everyone lives in a house. She doesn't yet have any friends when
   she meets Jennifer on her way back to school after lunch on Halloween
   day. Although dressed as a Pilgrim, Jennifer claims to be a real witch.
   After one Saturday meeting, Jennifer takes Elizabeth as an apprentice
   and sets weekly meetings with assignments. "For the first week ... you
   must eat a raw egg every day. And you must bring me an egg every day.
   Make mine hard boiled." They meet only in school, the library, the
   park, or the woods between home and school. The apprenticeship is
   difficult for Elizabeth. Sometimes she gets mad at Jennifer, but
   "before I'd got Jennifer, I'd had no one."

   After several weeks, they choose a long project--to prepare an ointment
   that conveys the ability to fly. It will also be a test for Elizabeth's
   promotion from apprentice. The final ingredient will be a live toad,
   selected in advance. During the intervening months, the toad becomes a
   pet. Elizabeth stops Jennifer from adding him to the brew, which
   terminates the ointment and their friendship. Later she realizes that
   her affection for the toad was part of the test.

   Finally Elizabeth deduces that Jennifer's dad is gardener at "The
   Estate" across the street, and they live on site. As Elizabeth proudly
   puts the clues together, Jennifer is walking to her door. Inside,
   Jennifer soon laughs and admits that the whole witch thing was just a
   make-believe fantasy. The two girls become normal friends who focus on
   reality-based pursuits.

   The book was turned into an NBC afterschool special called "Jennifer
   and Me" that aired on March 3, 1973. Peabody Award winner June
   Reig produced, directed and wrote the special.
