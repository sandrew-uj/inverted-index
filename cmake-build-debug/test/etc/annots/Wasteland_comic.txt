   Thus far, the comic has established two distinct storylines. The first
   follows a scavenger named Michael who roams the wasteland, trading what
   he can salvage. His life changes forever when he finds a machine that
   talks in a forgotten language, supposedly giving directions to the
   fabled land of A-Ree-Yass-I, where mankind's downfall began. Michael
   tries to trade the machine at a small town of Sunners called
   Providence, and his fate becomes intertwined with the town's sheriff,
   Abi.

   The second storyline follows the political machinations of a large city
   known as Newbegin, where the city's leader Marcus (aka Lord Founder) is
   oppressing the Sunner population, most of whom are slaves.
