   The sequel picks up shortly after the end of Daemon. Sobol's
   distributed AI has already infiltrated the computer systems of numerous
   companies and governments. Many companies have surrendered, either out
   of fear of annihilation or because they have been converted to the
   fairer and more efficient system using a kind of government by
   algorithm. While the Daemon is a technological creation, much of the
   work is carried out by human beings, compelled by the Daemon to change
   the world, according to the vision of Matthew Sobol.

   Connected by the "Darknet", the human followers, using Sobol's game
   engine (for his award-winning game "The Gate") as a base, have created
   their own ranking system and economy. Online identities mimic an
   MMORPG, with operatives doing tasks to gain levels and gaining access
   to new technologies and help from the Daemon in an effort to advance
   their communities. Numerous towns have slowly joined the Daemon's
   network as a means to improve their own situations and their society as
   a whole.

   The rest of the world believes the Daemon is still a hoax, due to the
   efforts of the US government (and its allies) to appear to the general
   public that they are still in charge. In truth, the American political
   and economic system is collapsing, with the price of fuel and the
   unemployment rates both skyrocketing.

   As with the first book, the interweaving stories follows specific
   characters:

   Detective Sebeck, now acting as an unwilling Daemon operative, has been
   sent on a "quest" by the avatar of the late Matthew Sobol, one in which
   will to determine the role of freedom to the human race. Using special
   glasses to see online Darknet items and threads, Sebeck is joined by a
   Daemon operative, Laney Price, and he soon learns that his quest is
   being monitored by the entire Darknet community.

   Sebeck begins his quest meeting another operative named Riley, who
   introduces him to the newly growing Daemon communities, dubbed Holons,
   which are based on being self-sufficient, using natural energy sources
   and technologies, and avoiding the military-industrial complex opposed
   to the type of freedom that the Daemon communities want. Riley teaches
   Sebeck how to navigate the Darknet and to use it to his advantage. With
   Laney in tow, Sebeck journeys around the country, always witnessing
   important events in the history of the Daemon. Sebeck reunites with Jon
   in a town called Greely, Iowa.

   It is one of several Midwestern towns chosen by the elite powers for
   invasion and destruction. Sebeck's Darknet quest thread returns, and he
   and Laney follow it through enemy lines, only to discover that it is a
   trap laid by the Major, who has developed a means of infiltrating the
   Daemon mainframe and make slight alterations. After being bound and
   interrogated by the Major, who offers to give him his former life back
   as a detective, husband, and father in return for his cooperation and
   information, Sebeck refuses. As he and Laney are taken to be executed
   via a wood chipper, Loki arrives with a pack of Razorbacks, killing
   their captors, and Moseley arrives to rescue him and Price. Reuniting
   with other Darknet faction members, Sebeck participates in the attack
   on the Sky Ranch that results in the destruction of the corporate
   monopoly and the Daemon research team.

   After the fighting, Sebeck resumes his quest and travels with Laney,
   Jon Ross, and Natalie Phillips to Morgan's Point Cemetery in Texas. The
   3D avatar of Mathew Sobol reveals his intentions and desires for a
   world in which all are equal. Having seen both sides and the war that
   followed Sebeck makes the choice that the Daemon is not a threat and
   allows the world now forming to exist. Then, Sebeck is rewarded with an
   online message from his son Chris, who forgives him for all that has
   happened, and Sebeck happily heads home to be reunited with his family.

   Jon Ross, fearing both the established authority and the actions of
   people like Loki, has joined the Daemon community to help shape it into
   a thing for good. He travels to China to recruit an old friend (and
   former spy) Shen Liang, but Liang refuses to believe that the Daemon
   network is real. Using Daemon technology that cloaks his image on CCTV
   cameras, Ross escapes before he can be taken into custody. Ross
   attempts to convince Natalie Phillips to join the Daemon community, but
   she rebuffs him. Ross then heads to Greely, meeting Hank Fossen,
   awaiting Sebeck's approach. The reunion is short-lived when they learn
   that Greely is surrounded by private security forces.

   Ross joins several other townsfolk to defend Greely, but they are
   outnumbered and outmatched by the heavy weapons and armored fighting
   vehicles of the private security forces. They are almost killed, but
   the virtual Darknet avatar of Roy Merritt, a Level 200 champion,
   rescues them and defeats the private security forces with airborne
   laser drones after they refuse to surrender. Worried that Natalie will
   be in danger from Loki's machines during his impending attack on Sky
   Ranch, he travels there to give her a Darknet Amulet of Protection.
   After the battle is won, he and Natalie join Sebeck in the last leg of
   his quest, preparing for a life together.

   At the funeral for Roy Merritt, NSA Agent Natalie Philips is approached
   by Loki who informs her that the Daemon operatives attending are there
   to honor his memory. Merritt has become a folk hero of the Darknet,
   known as "The Burning Man" by the Darknet users, who respect him for
   his tenacity. Loki tries to show her that she is working for the wrong
   side, but instead, she attempts to warn the authorities. Loki, in
   response, attacks a number of funeral attendants but only members of
   the private military contractor employed by the Major, Korr Security
   International.

   Following the funeral, Phillips is made a scapegoat and relieved of her
   duties at the NSA. Ross attempts to convince her to join the Daemon
   community, but she refuses. Phillips has a plan to stop the government
   from taking control of the Daemon by destroying it. To that effect,
   Phillips allows herself to be recruited by the Major and a man named
   General Johnston. Flown to the Sky Ranch, the remaining base of
   operations for the ani-Daemon forces, Phillips is informed of their
   plan to seize control of the Daemon in a worldwide operation code,
   named Exorcist. After reading over a detailed report of Operation
   Exorcist, Phillips is highly suspicious of the relatively simple
   exploit in the Daemon's code that is described.

   With the defeat of the General's offensive against the Daemon
   communities, Phillips is reunited with Ross, and together, they realize
   that Johnston's true plan is to allow most of the world's corporations
   to be destroyed by the Daemon (while protecting their own assets) and
   using the inevitable chaos to seize control of key facilities around
   the globe and declare a new world order with them in control. The
   General has no real use for Phillips other than to testify to the world
   the orthodox details of how the Daemon was supposedly defeated from the
   bogus report that she was given after the operation itself was over.
   However, they soon learn that Sobol had intentionally left fake errors
   in the Daemon's code and that the Daemon was many steps ahead of the
   private corporations, broadcasting their attempt to take over the world
   to the public and eliminating the personal wealth of everyone in
   charge. Declaring her love for Ross, together, they head off with
   Sebeck to witness him finish his quest and prepare for their future
   together.

   Brian Gragg ("Loki Stormbringer") is the most powerful known human
   Daemon operative in existence, a Level 56 Sorcerer. Working with only
   his personal contingent of Razorbacks along with advanced weapons and
   armor, he scours America looking for the Major. Though he is well
   known, his rankings is low for his antisocial behavior and his rude,
   spiteful disposition. Heinrich Boerner, the 3D avatar of the Nazi
   soldier Gragg defeated to gain the attention of the Daemon in the first
   place, offers to become his ally because of Loki's extremely high power
   level, offering to commit any act or execute any order upon the
   conditions of the said order being met, including taking revenge for
   Loki if he were to be killed. Loki quickly accepts this offer.

   Loki's first attempt to kill the Major fails when the Major escapes
   across water, where he is safe from Loki's machines, but eventually,
   Loki gains a lead that allows him to track the Major to a roadside
   motel. After using his Razorbacks, AutoM8s, and 'Angel Teeth' (guided
   spikes dropped from above) to kill the private security team guarding
   the Motel, he enters to find not the Major but an attractive girl,
   being held hostage. She claims that she is a low-level Daemon operative
   captured on a mission to deliver a valuable Darknet power ring. When
   Loki puts the ring on in an attempt to steal it, the ring injects Loki
   with a paralytic serum; he kills the girl with a blast of lightning
   before falling to the ground. Before falling unconscious, he sees
   several more men enter the room and destroy his Razorbacks, which he is
   unable to control, and he is finally captured by the Major.

   Brought to a stable, Loki is stripped nude and tortured by the Major
   and removed from the Daemon's network. All biometric markers are cut
   off including his tongue, eyes and finger tips. However, it is later
   revealed that he was eventually rescued by the avatar of Boerner and
   implanted with cybernetic eyes, fingers, and a hypersonic speech
   module. He rescues Sebeck from being killed and then uses his Darknet
   power to dispatch an enormous army AutoM8's and Razorbacks to level Sky
   Ranch, hellbent on killing the Major.

   After defeating the perimeter guard, his brutal assault on everyone at
   the Sky Ranch (including civilians) incurs the ire of the entire Daemon
   community. After being a large amount of negative ratings, the avatar
   of Roy Merritt arrives and attempts to reason with him to stop the
   killing, but when he refuses, Merritt uses his power to demote Loki to
   just level 10. Emotionally ruined and with all of his power taken away,
   Loki collapses, but his fellow Daemon members reach out to help him.

   Hank Fossen is a third-generation farmer from Greely, who is recruited
   into the Daemon network by his daughter Jenna. Fighting a nuisance
   lawsuit against a company Halperin Organix, which has been illegally
   planting seeds on his property to create patent violations, Hank learns
   of Jenna's participation with a suspicious group in town. Jenna reveals
   the concept of the Daemon to Hank and promises that Halperin Organix's
   lawsuit will be dismissed now that they have gained "level 4 legal
   protection."

   An assault on their farm, by hired mercenaries, is thwarted by Ross and
   other Daemon operatives, but upon learning about the impending assault
   on Greely, Hank sends Jenna and his wife to a predetermined shelter and
   then tries to help make a stand with Ross and the local Sheriff. Hank
   is shot and killed in the assault, but his sacrifice is not in vain.
   Using a community-created 3D avatar of Roy Merritt to coordinate a
   counterattack, the holon of Greely is able to defeat the assault force.

   The Major is now the most wanted man in the Daemon community for his
   numerous crimes including the murder of Roy Merritt. An old hand at
   suppressing third worlds, the Major continues to make plans against the
   Daemon. He ruminates about his past as a heavy for the big
   corporations, killing people who have threatened their exploitation of
   foreign countries. He escapes an attempt on his life by Loki, but the
   experience makes the Major realize that he may not win this war.

   In battling the Daemon, the government has been forced into a difficult
   alliance with private corporations employing the Major, giving rise to
   private armies who use the cover of night and corporate propaganda to
   create a state of fear. Intensifying his efforts the Major has
   dispatched foreign bought mercenaries and uses the corporate media to
   lie to the general public.

   Developing a way to penetrate the Darknet by recruiting homeless
   teenagers, he eventually ambushes Loki taking him prisoner. He tortures
   Loki both for revenge and so that the Major can steal his identity
   within the Darknet. He later heads the Midwestern offensive from the
   Sky Ranch while simultaneously capturing Sebeck. After a speech in
   which he notes that the general population needs to be controlled by a
   ruling class, he orders Sebeck to be killed to keep the cover story of
   his past "execution".

   After his plans collapse, the Major hides in a secret bomb shelter at
   Sky Ranch and awaits a chance to escape. Ten days after the defeat of
   his forces, the Major heads above ground now using Loki's stolen
   identity, only to discover that he is surrounded by both Razorbacks and
   the 3D avatar of Boerner.

   The book ends with his inevitable death and the start of a new world.
