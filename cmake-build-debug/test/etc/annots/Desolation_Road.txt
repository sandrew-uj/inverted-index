   In the future, scientist Dr. Alimantando is trekking across the desert
   of a terraformed Mars and meets a humanoid "greenperson", who claims to
   have traveled through time to make sure Alimantando is in the right
   place at the right time to fulfill his destiny. It comes in the form of
   a 700-year-old sentient ROTECH environmental engineering module, or
   orph, which lies dying in the desert. It bequeaths itself and its
   resources to Dr. Alimantando, who dismantles the machine and uses its
   components to build his own oasis in the desert, which he names
   Desolation Road (instead of Destination Road) after consuming too much
   wine.

   Over time, several people find themselves at this settlement in the
   middle of nowhere, and are welcomed by Dr. Alimantando. Crime lord
   Jameson Jericho, Pasternoster of the Exalted Families, flees the
   violent destruction of his empire by his enemies, pursued by assassins
   and possessing a chip in his brain containing the consciousnesses of
   his Exalted Ancestors. Would-be pioneers Rael and Eva Mandella, and
   Rael's father Haran, arrive ahead of a sandstorm, and Eva gives birth
   to twins Limaal and Taasmin. Rajandra Das, a man with the power to
   charm machinery, is unceremoniously kicked off a train at a random stop
   that turns out to be Desolation Road. Industrial chemist Mikal Margolis
   and his put-upon mother, "the Babooshka" disembark another train and
   are stranded. The beautiful pilot Persis Tatterdemalion crash lands her
   plane near the town and, unable to repair the aircraft, stays. She and
   Mikal begin a relationship and open the Bethlehem Ares Railroad/Hotel.
   Identical lothario triplets Ed, Louie, and Umberto Gallacelli arrive at
   the B.A.R./Hotel having fled their raucous past. A mechanic, a lawyer,
   and a farmer respectively, they all simultaneously fall in love with
   Persis at first sight. Mikal, meanwhile, has become infatuated with
   Marya Quinsana, a veterinarian, whose dentist brother Morton is himself
   both infatuated with and fiercely possessive of his sister. The feuding
   Stalin and Tenebrae families arrive, and are given homesteads right
   next to each other. Mr. and Mrs. Stalin's unpleasant son Johnny is both
   befriended and abused by the Mandella twins. Meredith Blue Mountain and
   his daughter Ruthie, whom he secretly created in a genesis-bottle, come
   to town to avoid persecution by their former neighbors. Ruthie has the
   power to absorb the beauty around her, and release it outward at will.

   Haran Mandella marries the Babooshka, who despite her advanced age is
   desperate for another child. She commissions an artificial womb to
   carry their baby, but soon Genevieve Tenebrae, denied a child by her
   husband Gaston, steals the fetus and has Marya implant it in her. Nine
   months later, Genevieve gives birth to a daughter she names Arnie,
   while the artificial womb produces nothing; Hasan realizes what has
   occurred but cannot prove it. Rajandra Das speaks to a captive angel in
   a travelling show, and aids in its escape. Dominic Frontera, a
   representative from ROTECH's planetary maintenance division, arrives to
   inform the inhabitants of Desolation Road that their settlement will
   soon be destroyed thanks to an incoming ice comet. Part of the overall
   terraforming initiative and intended to add needed moisture into the
   atmosphere, the comet's trajectory was set with no knowledge of the
   town's existence, and cannot be stopped. Dr. Alimantando is desperate
   to complete his long-gestating formula for time travel to save the
   town, and the greenperson appears unexpectedly to provide the final
   calculations. Dr. Alimantando vanishes back in time to register
   Desolation Road as a town, effectively negating the threat of the
   comet, though the residents dream of the alternate timeline. Persis
   marries all three Gallacelli brothers, eventually having twins named
   Sevriano and Batisto.
