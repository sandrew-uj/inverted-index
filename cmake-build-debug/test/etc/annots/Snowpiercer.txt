   Seventeen years after an attempt to stop global warming via
   stratospheric aerosol injection catastrophically backfires, creating a
   new ice age in 2014, the remnants of humanity have taken to a
   circumnavigational train, the Snowpiercer, run by reclusive
   transportation magnate Wilford. The passengers on the train are
   segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor
   in squalid tail compartments controlled by armed guards.

   Urged by his father-figure Gilliam, Curtis and his second-in-command
   Edgar lead the tail passengers in a revolt after they realize the
   guards' weapons have no ammunition; bullets are believed to be extinct
   due to a previous revolt. They free Namgoong, a captive security
   specialist, who insists that his clairvoyant daughter Yona is freed as
   well. Namgoong helps the tail army progress forward, but they soon end
   up fighting guards with axes, overseen by Minister Mason. During the
   battle, the train goes into a tunnel, causing darkness that aids the
   axe wielders who have night vision systems, but the tail army bring
   torches and wins. Curtis captures Mason in order to use her as a
   bargaining chip to end the battle, but Edgar is fatally stabbed. The
   tail army stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes
   Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two
   parents who have had their children taken from them) toward the front
   of the train. They are unaware that Franco, loyal to Mason, escapes the
   tail army to rally more guards.

   Curtis's group travels through the first of several opulent cars.
   Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and consider that the
   ice may be thawing. They eventually reach a schoolroom, where a teacher
   is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness, just before a
   man brings eggs for the children to open to celebrate the eighteenth
   "New Year", each of which has marked one circumnavigation of the Earth.
   While the man goes to the tail army and shoots at them, freeing the
   captured guards in the process and revealing that bullets do exist
   still, the teacher shoots and kills Andrew before Grey kills her. In
   the tail section, Franco uses the distraction to kill the tail army and
   capture Gilliam. Franco sends a live feed to the television in the
   classroom as he executes Gilliam; Curtis, in return, kills Mason.
   Curtis's group moves on, but Franco soon catches up to them. Tanya and
   Grey are killed after fighting Franco, who is then seemingly killed by
   Curtis and Namgoong. The two, along with Yona, continue onward.

   They reach the last car before the engine. Namgoong reveals he and Yona
   had been collecting Kronole, an addictive drug but also a potent
   explosive, which he wants to use to blow the door to the outside,
   believing they can survive. Curtis stops them, as he wants to meet
   Wilford; Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, 17 years
   before, the tail section had resorted to cannibalism, and he had been
   nearly ready to eat the infant Edgar but Gilliam offered him his arm
   instead. Curtis wants to face Wilford to ask why he created this closed
   ecosystem. Just then, the engine door opens, and Wilford's assistant
   Claude emerges and wounds Namgoong before inviting Curtis inside.

   Curtis meets Wilford, and to his shock learns he and Gilliam conspired
   to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the train's population to
   sustainable levels. Wilford orders 74% of the tail passengers killed.
   He then offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears
   ready to accept when Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and pulls open
   a floorboard to reveal Andrew and Tanya's children, Andy and Timmy,
   working the engine as slaves. Appalled, Curtis knocks out Wilford and
   rescues Timmy from the machinery, though he loses his arm in the
   process. Curtis gives Yona matches to light the fuse for the Kronole,
   while Namgoong fights and kills Franco, who had followed them, along
   with partygoers from another car. As the door to the engine room will
   not close, Curtis and Namgoong use their bodies to protect Yona and
   Timmy from the blast.

   The explosion causes an avalanche that derails the train. Shortly
   after, Yona and Timmy escape the wreckage. They see a polar bear in the
   distance, indicating that life exists outside the train.
