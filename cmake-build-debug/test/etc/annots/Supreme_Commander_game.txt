   The setting of Supreme Commander is a future where humanity is able to
   travel through the galaxy quickly using a quantum gateway, which is a
   portal opened from the fabric of space leading to a designated location
   potentially light-years away. All of the colonies created by
   quantum-travelling mankind were governed by the Earth Empire, until the
   events that created the Cybran Nation and the Aeon Illuminate caused
   the empire to fall, and the Infinite War between these factions began.
