   In a desolate landscape, Bella (Maxine Peake), Anthony (Clint Dyer),
   and Clarke (Jake Davies) drive to a warehouse searching for something
   to help ease the pain of Jack, who is dying. While Clarke hot-wires a
   van, Bella and Anthony break into the warehouse. They find the box they
   are looking for, but behind it is a four-legged robotic guard--a "dog".
   The dog sprays Bella and Anthony with shrapnel that contains trackers,
   then climbs down and shoots Anthony dead. Bella flees without the box
   to her car, with Clarke following in the van. The dog jumps into the
   van, kills Clarke and pursues Bella. It eventually enters her car, but
   she sends the car off a cliff and escapes.

   Bella uses pliers to extract the tracker embedded in her leg. Over her
   walkie-talkie, she asks someone to pass a message to her loved ones in
   case she is killed. Bella is chased by the dog into a forest, climbing
   a nearby tree. The dog's forelimb was damaged in the car wreck, so it
   cannot climb the tree, and instead powers down and waits. Bella drains
   it of power by repeatedly throwing sweets at it, causing it to power up
   and down. When the dog no longer responds, Bella climbs down. She finds
   a compound and breaks in.

   Bella takes car keys and a shotgun from two rotting corpses in the
   bedroom. When the sun rises, the dog recharges and gains access to the
   compound. As the dog approaches, Bella leaps out and throws paint over
   its visual sensor, then throws the paint can to the corner of the room
   to distract it and hurries to the car. However, the car will not start,
   so she turns on the radio and hides. As the dog investigates the noise,
   Bella shoots it. The dog stabs her in the leg; she shoots it again and
   it falls to the ground. The dog releases an air-burst shell, showering
   Bella with tracker-embedded shrapnel.

   In the bathroom mirror, Bella sees many trackers in her face. She lifts
   a knife, but notices a tracker in her jugular vein. Bella speaks into
   her walkie-talkie, unsure if she can be heard, saying goodbye to her
   loved ones. As she puts the knife to her throat, the camera pans out
   over the landscape, showing dogs approaching and investigating. In the
   warehouse, the box's contents--dozens of teddy bears--have spilled onto
   the floor.
