   Central to the story is an artificial intelligence named H.A.R.L.I.E.,
   also referred to by the proper name "HARLIE"--an acronym for Human
   Analog Replication, Lethetic Intelligence Engine (originally Human
   Analog Robot Life Input Equivalents).

   HARLIE's story revolves around his relationship with David Auberson,
   the psychologist who is responsible for guiding HARLIE from childhood
   into adulthood. It is also the story of HARLIE's fight against being
   turned off, and the philosophical question of whether or not HARLIE is
   human; for that matter, what it means to be human.

   When HARLIE Was One contains one of the first fictional representations
   of a computer virus (preceded by Gregory Benford in 1970), and one of
   the first uses of the term "virus" to describe a program that infects
   another computer.^[1]
