   The 1632 series, also known as the 1632-verse or Ring of Fire series,
   is an alternate history book series and sub-series created, primarily
   co-written, and coordinated by American author Eric Flint and published
   by Baen Books.^[1]^[2]

   The series is set in 17th-century Europe, in which the small fictional
   town of Grantville, West Virginia, in the year 2000 was sent to the
   past in central Germany in the year 1631, during the Thirty Years' War.

   As of 2015, the series has five published novels propelling the main
   plot and over ten published novels moving several subplots and threads
   forward. The series also includes fan-written, but professionally
   edited, collaborative material which are published in bi-monthly
   magazine titled The Grantville Gazettes and some collaborative short
   fictions.^[3]

   In terms of the history of Time Travel literature, the 1632 series can
   be considered an extension and modification of the basic idea dating
   back to Mark Twain's "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court", in
   which a 19th-century American engineer, finding himself in 5th-century
   England, is able--all by himself--to introduce into the past society
   the full range of his time's technologies. In Flint's version, a whole
   modern community is transplanted into the past, in possession of a
   considerable amount of the material and written resources of modern
   society--making their success in changing the past more plausible.
