   Battle Angel Alita tells the story of Alita, an amnesiac female cyborg.
   Her intact head and chest, in suspended animation, are found by
   cybermedic expert Daisuke Ido in the local garbage dump. Ido manages to
   revive her, and finding she has lost her memory, names her Alita after
   his recently deceased cat. The rebuilt Alita soon discovers that she
   instinctively remembers the legendary martial art Panzer Kunst,
   although she does not recall anything else. Alita uses her Panzer Kunst
   to first become a bounty hunter killing cyborg criminals in the
   Scrapyard, and then as a star player in the brutal gladiator sport of
   Motorball. While in combat, Alita awakens memories of her earlier life
   on Mars. She becomes involved with the floating city of Zalem (Tiphares
   in some older translations) as one of their agents, and is sent to hunt
   down criminals. Foremost is the mad genius Desty Nova, who has a
   complex, ever-changing relationship with Alita.^[5]

   The futuristic dystopian world of Battle Angel Alita revolves around
   the city of Scrapyard (Kuzutetsu in the Japanese and various other
   versions), which has grown up around a massive scrap heap that rains
   down from Zalem. Ground dwellers have no access to Zalem and are forced
   to make a living in the sprawl below. Many are heavily modified by
   cybernetics to better cope with their hard life.

   Zalem exploits the Scrapyard and surrounding farms, paying bounty
   hunters (called Hunter-Warriors) to hunt criminals and arranging
   violent sports to keep the population entertained. Massive tubes
   connect the Scrapyard to Zalem, and the city uses robots for carrying
   out errands and providing security on the ground. Occasionally,
   Zalemites (such as Daisuke Ido and Desty Nova) are exiled and sent to
   the ground. Aside from the robots and exiles, there is little contact
   between the two cities.

   The story takes place in the former United States. According to a map,
   printed in the eighth volume, Scrapyard/Zalem is near Kansas City,
   Missouri, and the Necropolis is Colorado Springs, Colorado. Radio KAOS
   is at Dallas, Texas. Figure's coastal hometown is Alhambra, California.
   Desty Nova's Granite Inn is built out of a military base--NORAD at
   Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado.^[6]

   Battle Angel Alita is eventually revealed to take place in the 26th
   century. The sequel Battle Angel Alita: Last Order introduces a
   calendar era called "Era Sputnik" which has an epoch of AD 1957. The
   original Battle Angel Alita series begins in ES 577 (AD 2533) and ends
   in ES 590 (AD 2546), Battle Angel Alita: Last Order is mostly set
   roughly in ES 591 (AD 2547), and Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicle
   currently alternates between ES 373-374 (AD 2329-2330) and ES 594 (AD
   2550).
