   After an implied global nuclear catastrophe Japan has been reduced to a
   desert ("The Great Kanto Desert"), and the surviving humans seek out a
   meager living in the hot sands. Desert Punk focuses on the adventures
   of a wandering mercenary named Kanta Mizuno, nicknamed Desert Punk
   (Sunabozu), due to his seemingly incredible feats of skill and daring
   while on the job. Throughout the series, he acquires an apprentice and
   makes a few friends as well as many enemies.

   As of 13th volume, his apprentice Taiko (also known as Kosuna) leaves
   his side in order to pursue her own destiny in the desert; like her
   former teacher, she takes a student of her own.
