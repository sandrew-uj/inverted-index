   In UFO: Aftermath, the few human survivors of an alien attack are
   forced to abandon the Earth's surface to the invaders. In return for
   doing so, some of humanity are moved off-planet to orbital colonies and
   to a small Mars colony. Aftershock features the subsequent events on
   Earth a half-century later while Afterlight focuses on the hitherto
   ignored inhabitants of Mars concurrently with UFO: Aftershock.

   Time passes largely uneventfully in the high-tech yet rudimentary Mars
   base. Over 10,000 colonists remain in cryonic suspension, waiting for a
   time when the desert planet can support them. Among the fewer than
   thirty people awake, two new generations have risen and only the oldest
   now remember Earth. Contact with the increasingly authoritarian Council
   of Earth has become strained and recently cut altogether. Automation is
   very advanced and researchers are nearing the point where they can
   start terraforming Mars. However, an archaeological excavation disturbs
   something that should have been left alone.
