   Arienrhod, the Snow Queen, has secretly implanted several Summer women
   with clones of herself, in the hopes of extending her rule past her
   ritual execution at the end of Winter. Moon Dawntreader Summer is the
   only one of these clones to survive to adolescence. She and her cousin
   Sparks are lovers. Moon becomes a sibyl, a position of high status
   among the Summer people. Sibyls are both feared and revered; they
   possess the ability to answer any question by going into a trance
   state. Sibyls believe that they receive visions from the Lady, a sea
   goddess. Sparks is not chosen to become a sibyl. Angry at Moon for
   joining the sibyls without him and curious about his offworld heritage,
   he travels to Carbuncle, Tiamat's capital. He is immediately caught up
   by Arienrhod and eventually becomes the "Starbuck", the Snow Queen's
   consort and commander of the mer hunts.

   Moon receives a message, apparently from Sparks, urging her to come to
   Carbuncle, though sibyls may not legally enter the city. On her way,
   she becomes entangled with smugglers and is taken offworld. This is
   normally a one way trip for a Tiamatan citizen. Hegemony law prevents
   any native Tiamatian from returning after leaving the planet, fearing
   that travelers would realize how Tiamat is being exploited and use this
   knowledge to foment rebellion. Arienrhod is crushed; she had planned to
   draw Moon to Carbuncle and make her the next Summer Queen. Moon was
   supposed to reject the Summer fear of technology and develop resistance
   to the Hegemony during the next Summer reign. Arienrhod devises a
   backup plan; she will unleash a plague at the Change which will kill
   most Summers and spare most Winters, allowing Tiamat to continue its
   technological growth before the Hegemony returns.

   Moon is taken to the capital planet, Kharemough, and discovers that the
   Winters' prejudice against sibyls is a political tool used by the
   Hegemony to preserve its control of technology on Tiamat. Sibyls are
   highly respected throughout the other planets of the Hegemony; only on
   Tiamat, due to a careful reinforcement of superstitions during the
   reign of Winter, are they considered dangerous and mentally unstable.
   The sibyls are actually part of a data network devised by the Old
   Empire as a way to rebuild society more quickly after the Empire's
   fall. Sibyls have the ability to communicate with a vast electronic
   databank, which explains their ability to answer seemingly unknowable
   questions. Moon learns from another sibyl that Sparks is in danger, and
   returns to Tiamat illegally. Due to time dilation, five years pass on
   Tiamat while Moon is only gone for a period of weeks.

   After a crash landing and short sojourn as a captive of Winter outlaws,
   Moon returns to Carbuncle and confronts Arienrhod. Arienrhod's plan to
   unleash the plague is foiled, but Moon is chosen to become the next
   Summer Queen. She prepares Tiamat to face the Hegemony as a peer when
   the 150 years of summer end and interstellar travel is again possible
   through the black hole.
