   Eunice is taken on as a housekeeper by a family of four. She has kept
   her illiteracy a secret and is obsessed by continuing to keep it so.
   Unknown to her new employers, she has already murdered the father for
   whom she had been caring, and has falsified her references. Her
   inability to adapt to her place in society is masked by the cunning
   with which she conceals the truth about herself. Misinterpreting every
   act of kindness she is offered by her employers, she eventually turns
   on them, stealing the guns that are normally kept locked away. With the
   aid of a fellow social misfit, she murders the entire family. But
   Eunice's illiteracy prevents her from recognizing and disposing of a
   written clue that was left behind. Eventually a tape recording of the
   shooting made by one of the victims is discovered. Eunice is charged
   with the crime, and is mortified when her illiteracy is revealed to the
   world during the court proceedings.
