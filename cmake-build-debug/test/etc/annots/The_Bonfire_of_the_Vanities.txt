   The story centers on Sherman McCoy, a successful New York City bond
   trader. His $3 million Park Avenue co-op, combined with his
   aristocratic wife's extravagances and other expenses required to keep
   up appearances are depleting his great income, or as McCoy calls it, a
   "hemorrhaging of money." McCoy's secure life as a self-regarded "Master
   of The Universe" on Wall Street is gradually destroyed when he and his
   mistress, Maria Ruskin, accidentally enter the Bronx at night while
   they are driving back to Manhattan from Kennedy Airport. Finding the
   ramp back to the highway blocked by trash cans and a tire, McCoy exits
   the car to clear the way. Approached by two black men whom they
   perceive--uncertainly, in McCoy's case--as predators, McCoy and Ruskin
   flee. After Ruskin takes the wheel of the car to race away, it
   fishtails, apparently striking one of the two would-be assailants--a
   "skinny boy."

   Peter Fallow, a has-been, alcoholic journalist for the tabloid City
   Light, is soon given the opportunity of a lifetime when he is persuaded
   to write a series of articles about Henry Lamb, a black youth who has
   allegedly been the victim of a hit and run by a wealthy white driver.
   Fallow cynically tolerates the manipulations of Reverend Bacon, a
   Harlem religious and political leader who sees the hospitalized youth
   as a "projects success story gone wrong." Fallow's series of articles
   on the matter ignites a series of protests and media coverage of the
   Lamb case.

   Up for re-election and accused of foot-dragging in the Lamb case, the
   media-obsessed Bronx County District Attorney Abe Weiss pushes for
   McCoy's arrest. The evidence includes McCoy's car (which matches the
   description of the vehicle involved in the alleged hit and run), plus
   McCoy's evasive response to police questioning. The arrest all but
   ruins McCoy; distraction at work causes him to flub on finding an
   investor for a $600 million bond on which he had pegged all his hopes
   of retiring the mortgage on his home and covering his family costs.
   While McCoy is getting a dressing down from his boss for failing to
   sell the bond, his lawyer, Tommy Killian, calls to tell him of his
   upcoming arrest, forcing him to admit his legal problems to his boss
   and being given a leave of absence as a result. McCoy's upper class
   friends ostracize him, and his wife leaves him and takes their daughter
   Campbell (McCoy's only source of genuine family love) to live with his
   parents.

   Hoping to impress his boss as well as an attractive former juror,
   Shelly Thomas, Assistant District Attorney Larry Kramer aggressively
   prosecutes the case, opening with an unsuccessful bid to set McCoy's
   bail at $250,000. Released on $10,000 bail, McCoy is besieged by
   demonstrators who are protesting outside his home.

   Fallow hears a rumor that Maria Ruskin was at the wheel of McCoy's car
   when it allegedly struck Lamb, but has fled the country. Trying to
   smoke out the truth, on the pretense of interviewing the rich and
   famous, Fallow meets with her husband, Arthur, at a pricey French
   restaurant. While recounting his life, Arthur has a fatal seizure, as
   disturbed patrons and an annoyed maitre d'hotel look on. Ruskin is
   forced to return to the United States for his funeral, where McCoy
   confronts her about being "the only witness." Fallow, spying on Maria,
   overhears that she, not McCoy, was driving.

   Fallow's write-up of the association between Sherman McCoy and Maria
   Ruskin prompts Assistant D.A. Kramer to offer her a deal: corroborate
   the other witness and receive immunity, or be treated as an accomplice.
   Ruskin recounts this to McCoy while he is wearing a wire. When a
   private investigator employed by Killian discovers a recording of a
   conversation that contradicts Ruskin's statement to the grand jury - a
   recording that was obtained from an illegal voice-activated intercom
   device installed by the landlord of a rent-controlled apartment as a
   way to remove tenants - the judge assigned to the case declares her
   testimony "tainted" and dismisses the case.

   In the epilogue, a fictional New York Times article informs us that
   Fallow has won the Pulitzer Prize and married the daughter of City
   Light owner Sir Gerald Steiner, while Ruskin has escaped prosecution
   and remarried. McCoy's first trial ends in a hung jury, split along
   racial lines. Kramer is removed from the prosecution after it is
   revealed he was involved with Shelly Thomas in a sexual tryst at the
   apartment formerly used by Ruskin and McCoy. It is additionally
   revealed that McCoy has lost a civil trial to the Lamb family and,
   pending appeal, has a $12 million liability, which has resulted in the
   freezing of his assets. The all-but-forgotten Henry Lamb succumbs to
   his injuries from the accident; McCoy, penniless and estranged from his
   wife and daughter, awaits trial for vehicular manslaughter. In the
   novel's closing, Tommy Killian holds forth:

     If this case was being tried in foro conscientiae [in the court of
     the conscience], the defendants would be Abe Weiss, Reginald Bacon,
     and Peter Fallow of The City Light.
