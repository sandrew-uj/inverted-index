   The story begins with Turnatt, an evil tyrant hawk and lord of Fortress
   Glooming, watching the construction of his fortress. Farther in the
   forest of Stone-Run are two tribes: the Bluewingle tribe of the blue
   jays and the Sunrise tribe of the cardinals, which are at war with each
   other, each accusing the other of stealing their eggs and food, not
   knowing that this is actually the work of Turnatt.

   A member of the Bluewingle tribe, a female blue jay named Aska, meets a
   robin named Miltin, a slave at Fortress Glooming, who warns her of
   Turnatt. Aska leaves and tells the two tribes of Turnatt.

   The groups make amends in time for the Bright Moon Festival, during
   which the Flying Willowleaf Theater arrive and help celebrate by
   telling the legend of Swordbird, a giant dove-like bird of peace with
   magical powers. The celebration is cut short when a group of Turnatt's
   soldiers attack, attempting to capture and enslave the two tribes and
   the members of the Flying Willowleaf Theater.

   The tribes manage to defeat the soldiers and decide to summon
   Swordbird, thinking that he is the only one with the power to defeat
   Turnatt, using his Leasorn Sword. The only problem is that Swordbird
   can only be sumonned by a song and one of the Leasorn Gems, which are
   said to be crystallized tears of the Great Spirit. There are only seven
   Leasorn Gems in the world, with an eighth one in Swordbird's blade. All
   hope seems lost until a recently escaped Miltin tells them that his
   tribe has one of the Leasorn Gems. The tribes decide to send Aska and
   Miltin over the White Cap Mountains to reach Miltin's home, the
   Waterthorn tribe.

   While Miltin and Aska are away, Turnatt sends his raven spy, Shadow, to
   destroy the two villages. Shadow and his group manage to set the
   Bluewingle tribe's home ablaze. The Bluewingle tribe take refuge with
   the Sunrise tribe. Shadow and his group attempt to light the Sunrise
   village on fire too, but are attacked by the tribe members and
   scattered.

   At the White Cap Mountains Aska and Miltin are attacked by a group of
   Slarkills and Miltin is mortally wounded and slowly dying. The two make
   it to the Waterthorn tribe where Miltin dies and Aska convinces the
   tribe to aid her tribes against Turnatt. The Winterhorn tribe arrives
   in time to help the Sunrise and Bluewingle tribes and the members of
   the Flying Willowleaf Theater in their battle against Turnatt and his
   attacking army.

   Aska manages to summon Swordbird, who quickly kills Turnatt. With their
   leader dead, Turnatt's army leave and the birds of Stone-Run release
   all those enslaved in Fortress Glooming. Two years later, Aska is
   married to Cody, an old friend of hers, the Sunrise and Bluewingle
   tribe have formed together as the Stone-Run Forest tribe, and Fortress
   Glooming has been made into the Stone-Run Library. The story ends with
   Cody and Aska visiting the grave of Miltin and leaving one of
   Swordbird's feathers.^[1]
