   It has been nearly twenty years since the start of the apocalyptic
   worldwide pandemic known as the Zombie War, and about ten years since
   the war has ended in humanity's victory. The framing device for the
   novel follows "Max Brooks", author of the Zombie Survival Guide
   (referred to simply as "the civilian survival guide" in this book) an
   agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission, as he travels the world
   interviewing survivors of this zombie plague.

   The exact origin of the zombie plague is unknown, but the first cases
   of what became the global pandemic began in China. It is implied that
   the virus is ancient, and was somehow released due to geological
   disruption caused by the Three Gorges Dam. The Politburo fears that the
   outbreak will be seen as weakness to foreign powers, so it attempts to
   hush it up (mirroring its previous attempts to downplay the 2002-2004
   SARS outbreak). Realizing that large-scale security sweeps for zombies
   cannot be covered up, the Politburo simply covers up what the sweeps
   are for, by initiating a military crisis with Taiwan as a distraction.
   Despite the lockdown, the plague continues to spread to neighboring
   nations by human trafficking, refugees, and the black market organ
   trade. The first large scale, publicly known outbreak occurs in Cape
   Town, South Africa - leading to the plague being nicknamed "African
   Rabies". This makes the public dismiss the epidemic as simply a severe
   strain of rabies that mostly affects poor African countries (mirroring
   how the first name used to refer to HIV, "Gay-related immune
   deficiency", treated it as a disease that only affected a minority
   group). For a full year, world governments and the public at large
   respond to the growing epidemic with total complacency, unwilling to
   invest resources in disaster response and prevention, despite the
   warnings of medical experts.

   The sole nation to take reports of the infection seriously is Israel -
   stated to be due to a policy put in place after the surprise of the Yom
   Kippur War for its intelligence community to consider every threat, no
   matter how ridiculous. Israel initiates a "voluntary self-quarantine",
   closing its borders and constructing a massive wall around its entire
   perimeter. In order to withdraw to a more defensible position, Israel
   abandons the Palestinian territories (including all of Jerusalem). In
   an attempt to convince its neighbors that this quarantine is not a
   land-grab, Israel also allows all uninfected Palestinians safe passage
   into its borders before they completely shut down. This refugee policy
   and the loss of Jerusalem lead to Israel's right-wing ultra-orthodox
   starting a brief but bloody civil war, though it is put down by the
   IDF.

   Most other world governments do not take Israel's quarantine seriously.
   The United States does little to prepare because of its overconfidence
   in its ability to suppress any threat, and the desire to not cause a
   panic during an election year. Although special forces teams contain
   initial small-scale domestic outbreaks, a widespread effort never
   starts: the US is deprived of political will by "brushfire wars", and a
   widely distributed and marketed placebo vaccine, Phalanx, creates a
   false sense of security.

   The following spring, a journalist reveals that Phalanx does nothing to
   prevent zombification, and that the infected are not victims of rabies
   but rather walking corpses, sparking an event known as the "Great
   Panic." Order breaks down around the globe as countries discover the
   true severity of the catastrophe, and for a time this initial wave of
   rioting and breakdown of essential services kills more people than the
   zombies. As entire regions are overrun by the undead, millions of
   panicked refugees try to flee to safety: attempts by Iran to stem the
   flow of refugees from Pakistan result in a nuclear exchange that
   obliterates both countries. Russia forces a decimation of its own
   military to stop and prevent mutinies. Ukraine uses its stockpile of
   chemical weapons against large numbers of refugees and soldiers alike
   to root out the infected from the uninfected population as zombies,
   unlike humans, are unaffected by nerve gas.

   After zombies overrun New York City, the US military sets up a
   high-profile defense in the nearby city of Yonkers in the hope that a
   great display of military power will help restore public order. The
   "Battle of Yonkers" is a disaster, however; Cold War-era weapons and
   tactics focused on disabling vehicles and wounding or frightening the
   enemy prove ineffective against zombies, who use human wave attacks,
   can only be killed by direct damage to the brain, and have no
   self-preservation instincts. The unprepared and demoralized soldiers
   are routed on live television. For several weeks, human civilization
   teeters on the brink of collapse.

   In South Africa, the government adopts a contingency plan drafted by
   apartheid-era intelligence consultant Paul Redeker, known as the
   Redeker Plan. It calls for the establishment of small safe zones,
   leaving large groups of survivors abandoned in special zones as human
   bait, serving as a distraction to the undead and allowing those within
   the main safe zones time to regroup and recuperate. Governments
   worldwide assume similar plans which prove successful. The United
   States government establishes its safe zone west of the Rocky
   Mountains, with the US government relocating to Honolulu, Hawaii. Those
   left behind east of the Rockies are instructed to evacuate north, as
   zombies freeze solid in extreme cold. Many panicked and unprepared
   civilians in North America flee to the wildernesses of northern Canada
   and the Arctic, where eleven million people die of starvation and
   hypothermia.

   Other safe zones are established by surviving governments around the
   world. The United Kingdom retreats to Scotland and Ireland. Continental
   Europe is almost totally overrun, except for safe zones in the Denmark
   and Iberian peninsulas, as well as in the Alps. Russia retreats to
   trans-Ural Siberia, and India establishes safe zones in the valleys of
   the Himalayas. South American nations retreat west of the Andes
   Mountains, while Cuba becomes a bastion against the undead due to its
   island geography and disproportionately strong military. In the
   Pacific, Australia establishes a safe zone in Tasmania, while Japan
   opts to evacuate its population to the colder Kamchatka peninsula in
   Russia.

   The surviving safe zones spend the next seven years gradually
   rebuilding their industrial base within their new, limited borders. A
   United Nations conference is then held off the coast of Honolulu aboard
   the USS Saratoga, deciding to go on the offensive to retake the planet.
   Determined to lead by example, the US military reinvents itself to meet
   the specific strategic requirements of fighting the undead, including
   the distribution of semiautomatic weapons, retraining soldiers to aim
   for zombie's heads, and the invention of the "lobotomizer," a melee
   weapon designed to quickly destroy a zombie's head. Backed by a
   resurgent US wartime economy, the military begins the three-year-long
   process of retaking the contiguous United States from both the undead
   swarms and groups of hostile human survivors. Entirely new strategies
   have to be implemented for this "war": each zombie is an independent
   fighting unit with no logistical lines or command structure to target,
   thus the war is a large-scale campaign of total extermination, slowly
   clearing and securing every mile of territory because even a single
   surviving zombie could restart the infection cycle.

   Other nations that voted to attack go about their own offensives:
   Russia, its armories badly-depleted, resorts to using large stores of
   World War II-era tanks, firearms, flamethrowers and ammunition, waging
   a costly offensive against the undead by brute force. The United
   Kingdom takes a slow-but-steady approach, taking until five years after
   the official end of the war to finish clearing its territory. France,
   set on restoring its pride and reputation after embarrassments and
   defeats going back to World War I, charges headlong against the undead,
   its armed forces displaying extreme valor at an extraordinarily high
   cost. An unnamed British Army general comments as the war ends that
   there are "enough dead heroes for the end of time." China's Politburo
   refuses to make any strategic retreats, resulting in it becoming the
   worst hit country of the entire war. Eventually, half the Chinese
   military mutinies against the Politburo for its incompetence and
   destroys its leaders with a nuclear strike, after which the new
   government implements the Redeker Plan by retreating north to
   Manchuria.

   Ten years after the official end of the Zombie War, the world is still
   heavily damaged, but slowly on the road to recovery. Millions of
   zombies are still active, mainly on the ocean floor, mountains above
   the snow line, and arctic areas such as Scandinavia, Siberia, and
   northern Canada. Cuba has become a democracy and hosts the world's most
   thriving economy. Tibet is freed from Chinese rule, which in turn
   becomes a democracy as well, and hosts Lhasa as the world's most
   populated city. Following a religious revolution, Russia is now an
   expansionist theocracy and adopts a repopulation program, keeping the
   nation's few remaining fertile women as state broodmares. North Korea
   is completely empty, with the entire population presumed to have
   disappeared into underground bunkers or been wiped out in the outbreak.
   Iceland has been completely depopulated and, due to its lack of a
   properly equipped military force and the huge influx of infected
   refugees, remains the world's most heavily infested country. The
   overall quality of life has diminished as well, including shorter life
   expectancies, limited access to basic services such as running water
   and electricity, and an ongoing nuclear winter.

   Nevertheless, the majority of those who have survived have hope for the
   future, knowing that humanity faced the brink of extinction, and won.
