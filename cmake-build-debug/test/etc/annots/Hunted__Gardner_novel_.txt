   When new Explorer Corps recruit Edward York arrives on board the
   starship Willow, he abruptly becomes its sole survivor: everyone else
   simultaneously drops dead, executed by the near-omnipotent League of
   Peoples for violating its rule that anyone without sufficient respect
   for life is not allowed to travel between solar systems.

   Alone on a ship full of corpses, Edward discovers a complex plot
   involving the alien Mandasars, in whose decades-long civil war he had a
   cryptic role.
