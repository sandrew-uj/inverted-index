   Continuing his quest to reach the glorious southern realm of Khurdisan
   the Golden, Brak, a blond, braided and broadsword-wielding barbarian
   from the frozen north, crosses the desolate desert of Logol. By chance
   he meets a duo of royal twins whose throne has been usurped, and seek a
   champion to restore them. But their motives are dubious, their word
   untrustworthy, and behind all lurks the menace of the corrupt and evil
   cult of the demon god Yob-Haggoth, whose followers bear unrelenting
   hatred towards Brak.
