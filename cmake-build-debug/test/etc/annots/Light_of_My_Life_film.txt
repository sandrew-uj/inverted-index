   Almost a decade after a mysterious pandemic wiped out most of the
   female population, a man and his daughter Rag journey through British
   Columbia. Rag is one of the very few females of the human species left
   on Earth. Her dad must protect her by disguising her as his son from
   male bandits who are looking for any female human. In a flashback,
   before his wife dies, he promises to her that he will tell his daughter
   everything about her mom.

   After leaving the woods where they first camped, the two take shelter
   in an abandoned house. After staying for a few days, the two narrowly
   escape from four men breaking in looking for them. The father hitches a
   ride and steals the car from the owner to get themselves to his
   grandparents' home. Arriving there, they find that the house is now
   occupied by Tom and his two friends Calvin and Lemmy. Tom is a
   religious man and has a friendly approach to the father and Rag. At
   night, the two sneak out their belongings into a nearby cabin in case
   of a "red alert", a term the father uses when dangerous men are
   approaching. The next morning, Tom teaches Rag how to use a shotgun for
   self-defense. Tom eventually suspects that the "son" is a girl and he
   questions her father with concern, telling him that he lost nine female
   relatives in a matter of weeks. Moved by the story, the father admits
   that she is, indeed, his daughter.

   Later, three men arrive, barge into the house and kill Tom and Lemmy
   (Calvin apparently tipped off the intruders). Rag and her father hide
   in the attic and he manages to drop her out of the window. He then
   proceeds to fight and kill the first and the second bandits; however,
   the last attacker almost strangles him to death. Rag appears and shoots
   the bandit, killing him but also hitting her father's side. They go to
   the cabin, where Rag removes the shot pellet from her father's wound.
   While the father rests, a flashback shows the father promising his wife
   that he will look after Rag. After Rag has treated her father's wound,
   he says they will go to the safe place with friendly people that Tom
   mentioned earlier. As he breaks down in tears, Rag comforts him.
