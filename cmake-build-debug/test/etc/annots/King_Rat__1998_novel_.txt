   Saul Garamond returns to the flat he shares with his father in London
   late one evening, skipping on greetings and heading straight to bed. In
   the morning he is awakened by police pounding on the door, come to
   arrest him. It appears he is the lone suspect in his father's murder
   case. After spending most of a day being interrogated and in a holding
   cell, Saul finds he has a mysterious visitor, who introduces himself as
   King Rat. The two begin a one sided rooftop escape as King Rat carries
   Saul along. At the end of this journey, King Rat reveals to Saul that
   he is his uncle by way of Saul's mother being a rat and also that Saul
   has been set up to take the fall for his father's death.

   Saul follows King Rat exploring the secrets of London, from the
   rooftops to the sewers. Being half rat, his two primary abilities are
   being able to eat anything, even garbage, and squeezing into holes and
   shadows too small for other creatures. Meanwhile, Saul's friend Natasha
   Karadjian, a drum and bass musician, begins to write and record new
   music with a flautist named Pete. Two of their other mutual friends,
   Fabian and Kay, are unnerved by this stranger but find it hard not to
   like the music the two are making. These friends are also being pursued
   by the police for any information on Saul's whereabouts. After spending
   several days with King Rat, Saul hears whispers of the return of the
   Ratcatcher.

   This prompts King Rat to gather allies, Anansi, the spider king, and
   Loplop, the bird king; they are prompted to join him for their own
   reasons--the Ratcatcher is also after the Spidercatcher and
   Birdcatcher, their enemy as well. So, King Rat relates the story of
   living in Hamelin, the last time he really was king. But he was
   displaced, of course, by the Pied Piper of Hamelin and his flute. It is
   revealed that now the Piper travels the world seeking pests so he may
   kill for the fun of it. The three animal kings end the story by
   swearing revenge.

   Even with his newfound powers, Saul is forced to stay in the shadows
   with King Rat, but cannot forget his own friends and past. He visits
   Kay but the two no longer understand each other. This visit leads to
   Pete, being revealed as the returned Piper, finding and murdering Kay.
   Meanwhile, the animal kings' plans begin to fall short and they drift
   apart. Saul begins to push his new boundaries and explore London on his
   own. During this time, he meets Deborah, a vagrant. Together they
   return to Saul's former flat, where he finds his father's old notebook.
   Here finds an entry about an attack on his mother nine months before
   his own birth. He realises he is not King Rat's nephew but his son, by
   way of rape and that everything since his father's death has been a set
   up by King Rat, who must therefore be the murderer of the man Saul
   considers his father.

   As they discover these facts, the Piper confronts Saul and Deborah. He
   kills Deborah but Loplop saves Saul. The piper reveals that he cannot
   control Saul as he can the others, as the Piper can only play one song
   at a time and as such a tune that controls rats will be ignored by
   Saul's human side and vice versa. Saul returns to the sewers to
   confront King Rat, leading to a falling-out. He wants to go his own way
   and leave the Piper to the animal kings. Natasha and Pete have set up
   an act at a club, Jungle, to debut their music. Fabian is interrogated
   by the police again and he realises that the flute left behind when
   Saul was attacked belongs to Pete. He calls the police to meet him at
   Natasha's home but arriving ahead of them he is wounded and both he and
   Natasha are taken by the Piper.

   After wandering for a few days, Saul meets up with Anansi, who informs
   him of Kay's death by the Piper. He begins to notice something is wrong
   in the sewer as well, as the rats have disappeared, their scratching
   replaced by a new sound, music. He traces the sound back to King Rat's
   throne room, now filled with dancing and dead rats; who along with King
   Rat are mesmerised by the music playing on a ghetto blaster. Saul
   realises the title on the tape within is written in Natasha's
   handwriting. He finds a poster for Natasha and the Piper's show, and
   despite knowing it is a trap, he goes to save his friends.

   Saul sneaks into the club with his new rat allies and Anansi leading
   the spiders. Loplop, left deaf by Saul during the Piper's first attack
   is unable to rally his birds. However, when Natasha takes the stage to
   spin her records, Pete throws her a DAT, which has his flute samples on
   it. The layering of tracks allows the Piper to play several tunes at
   once, controlling the rats, clubbers and spiders all at once.

   Unable to defend himself Anansi is killed by the Piper and Saul is
   overwhelmed. However, King Rat bursts from under the stage and attacks
   the Piper, but proves to be only a momentary distraction. With the
   musical fusion playing, the entire club is under the Piper's control
   and all he wants to kill Saul, who will not dance for him. The music
   does not mesh: instead of one solo flute, two flutes compete for the
   overlying sound. This dissonance causes Saul to regain control just as
   the Piper attempts to kill him; he dodges the blow and resists the
   Piper. The Piper knows he cannot win a physical fight, so he tears a
   hole in reality by playing his flute through which he can escape, just
   as he tore a hole in the mountain to hide the children of Hamelin. King
   Rat attacks the Piper with the Piper's own flute; they both fall into
   the rent but King Rat jumps away, and suddenly the hole closes, the
   Piper on the other side.

   Saul and King Rat are unsung heroes of the club but they both know they
   can never be a part of the world they just saved. King Rat still wants
   his kingdom back from Saul. Saul refuses to give in and knows that if
   the Piper returns, King Rat will still need him, so he can't be killed
   to restore complete order to the rat kingdom. Saul then gathers his own
   band of rats and lies about King Rat's contribution, painting him as a
   coward and ensuring the rats will never again follow him. Saul makes
   the declaration that King Rat is not the one true leader of all rats
   and he is not Prince Rat, but he is one of them, Citizen Rat.
