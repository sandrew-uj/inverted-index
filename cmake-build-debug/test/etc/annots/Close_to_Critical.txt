   It began with human researchers sending a semi-autonomous robot to the
   surface of Tenebra. The robot descended on rocket boosters until
   atmospheric pressure exceeded the pressure in the rockets' combustion
   chambers. Instead of generating thrust, the rockets began to overheat
   and melt themselves, so the controllers jettisoned the engines and the
   robot completed its descent under a parachute.

   After acclimatizing itself to the dark world under Tenebra's thick
   clouds, the robot set out to explore. After months of mapping the
   territory and observing the plants and animals, the robot encountered a
   sentient native. The creature resembled a very large, scale-armored fir
   cone with four pairs of limbs; the lowest pair used for walking, the
   next pair apparently not used at all, and the upper two pairs used for
   prehension (used as arms and hands). A set of spines jutting from the
   top of the creature served as lensless eyes, making maximum use of the
   thin flow of photons seeping from the sky.

   Unseen by the native, the robot followed it, stole ten of its eggs and
   good selection of stone knives that the creature had set out in booby
   traps, and then took its loot far from the caves in which the creature
   and its clan lived.

   Sixteen years later Nick Chopper is on the run. Trying to elude the
   people he is certain are tracking him, he returns to the little hilltop
   village of huts that he shares with his nine siblings and the robot,
   now called Fagin (a reference to the character in Charles Dickens'
   novel Oliver Twist). He reports that while he was mapping some new
   territory he had encountered, for the first time, creatures just like
   himself. He had stayed with them long enough to learn a little of their
   language. Through a diplomatic error Nick gains the enmity of the chief
   of the people, a nine-foot brute whose name translates into English as
   Swift. Fearing that Swift intends to bring his warriors to their
   village to murder him and his siblings, Nick dares, for the first time,
   to travel at night, using burning sticks (fire on Tenebra does not
   produce flames, but merely glows the bright yellow-orange of fresh
   embers) both to light his way and to fend off the raindrops that would
   knock him out if one enveloped him.

   Before Nick, on Fagin's instructions, can go back down the trail to
   intercept Swift and make peace, Swift and his warriors arrive and
   attack the village. Using fire as a weapon, Nick and his siblings
   manage to fight Swift and his warriors to a stalemate. To avoid further
   violence, Fagin goes with Swift back to his cave village and Nick and
   his siblings prepare to abandon their village to find a safer place to
   stay.

   Meanwhile, aboard the space station Vindemiatrix, Dr Helven Raeder, the
   current voice of Fagin, is interrupted by Amindebarlee, the ambassador
   from Dromm, a planet of Eta Cassiopeiae (19.42 lightyears from Sol,
   21.92 lightyears from Altair), and his son Aminadorneldo. The presence
   of the Drommians, who resemble hairless ten-foot otters with five pairs
   of limbs and who have voices pitched much higher than human voices,
   reminds Raeder of something he can use to solve his problem with Fagin.

   The humans have built a space-going bathyscaphe that they intend to use
   to descend to Tenebra's surface and then return to Vindemiatrix. Raeder
   conceives the idea of using the craft to rescue Fagin by using the
   bathyscaphe's grapplers to pick up the robot and then fly it away so
   that Swift and his people cannot track it. Then he will move Nick and
   his siblings far away to avoid the inevitable retaliation.
   Unfortunately for Raeder's plan Aminadorneldo and Easy Rich, the
   twelve-year-old daughter of Councilor Rich, have gone to tour the
   bathyscaphe. While the two are alone aboard the craft, the bathyscaphe
   suffers an accident that sends it onto a trajectory that will compel it
   to land on Tenebra. Worse, although Aminadorneldo looks like an adult
   Drommian, he is actually four years old, with the development level of
   a seven-year-old Terran boy.

   The bathyscaphe lands safely on Tenebra, but the rescue team discovers
   that the electrolyzers do not work. Meant to use Tenebra's atmosphere
   as feedstock, they were intended to fill the bathyscaphe's flotation
   cells with hydrogen so that the craft would rise high enough into the
   atmosphere for its rocket engines to work and, in this case, to be
   intercepted by a shuttle that would stand on the thrust of its engines
   while an engineer finished connecting the circuits that would fire the
   bathyscaphe's rockets. In some desperation Raeder decides to ask Nick
   and his siblings to find the bathyscaphe and then, following his
   instructions, repair the electrolyzers.

   Having piled as many of their belongings as they can on the little cart
   that they have used in gathering firewood, Nick and the others round up
   their livestock (which they call by the English word cattle), and set
   out on Tenebra's first ever cattle drive, heading for the coast. Once
   they have found a relatively safe place and set up camp, Nick goes back
   to the cave village to rescue Fagin while the others set out to map the
   area around their camp. Using fire to distract Swift's people, Nick
   takes off with Fagin and rejoins his siblings. Swift and his people are
   not far behind, but before a battle can erupt Fagin convinces the two
   groups to work together in finding the bathyscaphe.

   Once the Tenebrites have found the bathyscaphe they must somehow send
   it high into the atmosphere. Rather than attempt to repair the
   electrolyzers, they use an alternative plan devised by Easy. They
   capture floaters, jellyfish-like creatures with stinging tentacles and
   hydrogen-filled flotation sacs. After hacking off the creatures'
   tentacles, they bring them to the bathyscaphe and squeeze their
   hydrogen directly into the bathyscaphe's buoyancy tanks. There's no
   shortage of floaters: a strange wind that has been blowing for many
   days keeps bringing more to the area. When the Tenebrites have put just
   enough hydrogen into the bathyscaphe's tanks the craft lifts off the
   ground and, in the other part of Easy's plan, the wind carries the
   craft to its source, the caldera of a wide and active volcano, whose
   hot updraft carries the bathyscaphe to its rendezvous with the shuttle.
