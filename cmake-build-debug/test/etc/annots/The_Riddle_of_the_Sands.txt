   Carruthers, a minor official in the Foreign Office, is contacted by an
   acquaintance, Davies, asking him to join in a yachting holiday in the
   Baltic Sea. Carruthers agrees, as his other plans for a holiday have
   fallen through, and because of a heartbreak due to a woman he courted
   becoming engaged to another man.

   He arrives to find that Davies has a small sailing boat (the vessel is
   named Dulcibella, a reference to Childers's own sister of that name),
   not the comfortable crewed yacht that he expected. However Carruthers
   agrees to go on the trip and joins Davies in Flensburg on the Baltic,
   whence they head for the Frisian Islands, off the coast of Germany.
   Carruthers has to learn quickly how to sail the small boat.

   Davies gradually reveals that he suspects that the Germans are
   undertaking something sinister in the German Frisian islands. This is
   based on his belief that he was nearly wrecked by a German yacht luring
   him into a shoal in rough weather during a previous trip. The yacht was
   owned and captained by a mysterious German entrepreneur called
   Dollmann, whom Davies suspects of being in fact an expatriate
   Englishman posing as a German. The situation was further complicated by
   Davies having fallen deeply in love with Dollmann's daughter, Clara -
   who, Davies is sure, is not involved in whatever nefarious scheme her
   father is engaged upon. In any case, Davies is suspicious about what
   would motivate Dollmann to try to kill him, and believed that it is
   some scheme involving the German Imperial government. Having failed to
   interest anyone in the British government in the incident, Davies feels
   it is his patriotic duty to investigate further on his own - hence the
   invitation to Carruthers.

   Carruthers and Davies spend some time exploring the shallow tidal
   waters of the Frisian Islands, moving closer to the mysterious site
   where there is a rumoured secret treasure recovery project in progress
   on the island of Memmert. The two men discover that Dollmann is
   involved in the recovery project. Carruthers and Davies try to approach
   Memmert. They are warned away by a German Navy patrol boat, the Blitz,
   and its commander von Bruening - who is friendly and affable, but still
   makes a veiled warning. This makes them all the more sure that there is
   something more than a treasure dig on the island. And meanwhile, they
   discover that, not only is Dollmann indeed an Englishman, he had been
   an officer in the Royal Navy - evidently having had to leave Britain in
   hurry and take up a new life as a German.

   Taking advantage of a thick fog, Davies navigates them covertly through
   the complicated sandbanks in a small boat to investigate the Memmert
   site. Carruthers investigates the island. He overhears von Bruening and
   Dollmann discussing something more than treasure hunting, including
   cryptic references to "Chatham", "Seven" and "the tide serving", and
   hears of a rendezvous at the Frisian railway station, several days
   ahead. The pair return through the fog to the Dulcibella, moored at the
   island of Norderney. There, they find Dollmann and von Bruening have
   beaten them and are seemingly suspicious. However, getting in the fog
   from Norderney to Memmert and back is a nearly impossible feat, which
   only Davies' superb seamanship could have achieved, and the Germans do
   not seriously suspect them of having done that.

   Von Bruening invites them to Dollmann's villa for a dinner, where he
   attempts to subtly cross-examine them to find out if they are British
   spies. Carruthers plays a dangerous game, admitting they are curious.
   But he convinces von Bruening that he believes the cover story about
   treasure and merely wants to see the imaginary "wreck". The party also
   serves to show that the Germans do not fully trust the renegade
   Englishman Dollmann and that there is some rift between them which
   might be widened.

   Carruthers announces that the Foreign Office has recalled him to
   England. He heads off, being accompanied part of the way to the Dutch
   border by one of the German conspirators - outwardly an affable
   fellow-traveler. But instead of embarking from Amsterdam to England, he
   doubles back, returns to Germany in time to be present at the
   conspirators' rendezvous (to which Dollmann, significantly, was not
   invited). He manages to follow von Bruening and his men without being
   noticed, and trails them to a port where they board a tugboat towing a
   barge. Carruthers then sneaks aboard and hides, and the convoy heads to
   sea.

   Carruthers finally puts the riddle together. The Germans are linking
   the canals and the railways, dredging passages through the shifting
   sands and hiding a fleet of tugs and barges. The only explanation is
   that they are going to secretly transport a powerful German army across
   the North Sea to invade Britain's east coast. He escapes after
   grounding the tugboat and rushes back to Davies. He finds him and
   explains how they must flee before the Germans come after them. They
   convince Dollmann and Clara to come with them to avoid Dollmann's being
   arrested by the Germans, who will think he has changed sides again.
   They promise Dollman immunity from being charged for treason in Britain
   - which, acting on their own and not having any authorization from the
   British government, they were not truly in a position to promise. As
   they sail across the North Sea, Dollmann commits suicide by jumping
   overboard, presumably to avoid disgrace and probable arrest.

   An epilogue by the "editor" examines the details of a report prepared
   by Dollmann, outlining his plan for the invasion force. A postscript
   notes that the Royal Navy is finally taking countermeasures to
   intercept any German invasion fleet and urges haste.
