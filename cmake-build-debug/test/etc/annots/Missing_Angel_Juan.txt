   The story begins with Witch Baby learning that Angel Juan is leaving to
   go to New York. He wants to go and discover who he is when he is not
   with Witch Baby. She is left broken-hearted and angry and falls into a
   depression before deciding to follow Angel Juan to New York.

   In New York, Witch Baby stays at the apartment of Weetzie Bat's
   deceased father, Charlie Bat. He appears to Witch Baby as a ghost and
   becomes her companion as she searches for Angel Juan. In the end, Witch
   Baby and Angel Juan are reunited, but Angel Juan tells her he needs to
   stay in New York a while longer and she has to return to Los Angeles.
   Witch Baby understands, because even though they cannot be together at
   present, they love each other and will be together again someday.
