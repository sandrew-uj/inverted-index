   The book picks up the story nine months after the end of Rama II. The
   book follows the story of three astronauts from the expedition in Rama
   II who were trapped aboard the cylindrical alien spacecraft, Rama II,
   heading out towards deep space. Along the journey, five children were
   born. Simone Tiasso Wakefield, Catharine Colin Wakefield, Eleanor Joan
   Wakefield, Benjamin Ryan O'Toole and Patrick Erin O'Toole, were born by
   Nicole des Jardins from her relationships with Richard Wakefield and
   Michael O'Toole. These children later become major characters in Rama
   Revealed. After a twelve-year journey, they arrive in the vicinity of
   the star Sirius, where all eight rendezvous with a Raman Node.

   At the Node they are subjected to physiological tests for a year while
   Rama is refurbished, and they are eventually sent back to the solar
   system, this time to collect two thousand more representatives of
   humanity. An Earth agency, known as the ISA, receives the message from
   Rama requesting two thousand humans. Upon its reception, the message is
   kept secret and, under the guise of a new Martian colony, the ISA
   starts acquiring its payload. The ISA selects a handful of their own
   representatives; meanwhile, they selectively gather convicts and
   promise them freedom if they are chosen to be a colonist. The payload
   is subdivided into three ships: the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria (names
   based on Christopher Columbus's ships Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria)
   that arrive sequentially at Rama. At this point the colonists believe
   everything is a hoax (despite the colossal size of Rama) created by the
   ISA. With that discontent as the tone upon their arrival, Rama III
   heads back to deep space with its new payload.

   Soon an aggressive group of humans, led by a mob boss, seizes control
   of the human colony and begins a war of annihilation and propaganda
   against one of the other races occupying the massive spacecraft. The
   original astronauts and their children find themselves powerless to
   prevent the genocide. However, the aggressive behavior of the human
   species does not go unnoticed: Another species, unknown to the humans,
   observe their behavior and start considering a possible counterattack.

   Meanwhile, Rama III determines that total escalation of the conflict is
   imminent and transmits an emergency signal to its ancient constructors.
   The book ends with a cliffhanger, on the eve of the execution of one of
   the original astronauts.
