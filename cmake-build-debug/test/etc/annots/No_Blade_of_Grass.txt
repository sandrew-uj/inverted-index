   A new virus strain has infected rice crops in East Asia causing massive
   famine; the virus is also revealed to be found in the UK but because of
   its selectivity does not affect the country's agriculture. After the
   introduction of a new pesticide, developed in preference to breeding
   resistant crops, a mutated virus appears and infects the staple crops
   of West Asia and Europe such as wheat and barley--all of the grasses
   (thus the novel's title). It threatens a famine engulfing the whole of
   the Old World, while Australasia and the Americas attempt to impose
   rigorous quarantine to keep the virus out.

   The novel follows the struggles of engineer John Custance and his
   friend, civil servant Roger Buckley, as, along with their families,
   they make their way across an England which is rapidly descending into
   anarchy, hoping to reach the safety of John's brother's potato farm in
   an isolated Westmorland valley. Buckley, having advance warning of the
   government's plot to hydrogen bomb major cities, alerts Custance to
   evacuate. Picking up a travelling companion in a gun shop owner named
   Pirrie after an attempt to procure arms, they find they must sacrifice
   many of their morals in order to stay alive. At one point, when their
   food supply runs out, they kill a family to take their bread. The
   protagonist justifies this with the belief that "it was them or us."

   By the time they reach the valley, they have accumulated a considerable
   entourage as a result of their encounters with other groups of
   survivors along the way. They find that John's brother is unable to let
   them all in to the heavily defended valley. Pirrie prevents John from
   taking only his immediate family into the valley; instead, the group
   takes the valley by force. Pirrie and John's brother are killed; John
   takes possession of the valley.
