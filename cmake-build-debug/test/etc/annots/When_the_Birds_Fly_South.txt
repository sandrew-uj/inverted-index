   Dan Prescott, an American adventurer, discovers the hidden valley of
   Sobul in a mountainous region of Afghanistan, inhabited by a strange
   race of winged people known as the "Ibandru". He falls in love with one
   of them, Yasma, and they marry in a scene of general celebration. When
   fall comes, however, the Ibandru abandon their valley to fly south with
   the birds for the winter. Unable to bear the loss of Yasma, Prescott
   pleads with her to remain with him rather than participate in the
   traditional migration, with tragic consequences for his marriage.
