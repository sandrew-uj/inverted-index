   The Chelgrians are a race of centaur-like cat aliens with three
   hind-limbs and a humanoid catlike torso. Major Quilan, a Chelgrian, has
   lost the will to live after the death of his wife, killed during the
   Chelgrian civil war that resulted from the Culture's interference. A
   high-ranked Chelgrian priest offers Quilan the chance to avenge the
   Chelgrians who died by taking part in a suicide mission to strike back
   at the Culture. His "Soulkeeper" (a device normally used to store its
   owner's personality upon their death) is equipped with both the mind of
   a long-dead Chelgrian admiral and a device given to the Chelgrians by a
   mysterious group of Involved aliens that can transport wormholes
   through which weapons can be delivered. Quilan is then sent to the
   Culture's Masaq' Orbital, ostensibly to persuade the renowned composer
   Mahrai Ziller to return to his native planet Chel, but in reality on a
   mission to destroy the Orbital's Hub Mind. To protect him from
   detection at Masaq', Quilan's memory is selectively blanked until he
   reaches his target, thus preventing the Mind from reading his thoughts.

   Ziller lives in self-imposed exile on Masaq', having renounced his
   privileged position in Chel's caste system. He has been commissioned to
   compose music to mark a climactic event in the Idiran-Culture War. Upon
   hearing of Quilan's visit, and suspicious of his reason for travel,
   Ziller scrupulously avoids him.

   Quilan succeeds in placing the wormholes in the Orbital's Hub, but the
   Mind was already aware of the plot because Quilan's operator, the long
   dead admiral housed in his Soulkeeper, is actually a turncoat spy for
   the Culture. Although unable to track the locations on the other ends
   of the wormholes, the Mind suggests that the Involved "aliens"
   assisting Quilan's mission may have been a group of bellicose Culture
   minds seeking to keep the Culture from being too complacent. Having
   struggled with painful memories of the Idiran-Culture war, when it was
   the General Systems Vehicle Lasting Damage, the Mind reveals to Quilan
   that it intends to destroy its own higher functions, essentially
   committing suicide, and offers to take Quilan with it. Quilan, who had
   become unsure of his own mission after experiencing dreams of his dead
   wife wearing the silvery skin of the Mind's avatar, agrees. They both
   commit suicide simultaneously during the climax of Ziller's concerto,
   leading to much shock and outrage.

   At the end of the novel, a nightmarishly efficient E-Dust Assassin is
   unleashed by the Culture in 'retribution' against the Chelgrian priest
   who acted as a pawn for the bellicose Culture Minds, as well as his
   immediate co-conspirators. The assassin kills the priest gruesomely by
   transforming into a swarm of insects that eat him from the inside out.
   Throughout the book there is a subplot about a Culture ethologist named
   Uagen Zlepe spending his time on a distant alien air sphere and
   discovering hints about the Chelgrian plot to destroy the Masaq'
   Orbital's Hub Mind. He attempts to warn the Culture, and the reader is
   led to believe that his intervention is the reason why the Mind knew
   about Quilan's sabotage, but ultimately he fails to get his message out
   and dies. His dead body is resurrected using alien technology an entire
   galactic grand cycle later, long after all the events of the story have
   ended. Back in the present, the Chelgrian admiral Huyler's personality,
   kept alive from Quilan's Soulkeeper, and the real source of the Mind's
   foreknowledge regarding the attack, is given a new body and becomes an
   ambassador to the Culture, enjoying a very high standard of living. He
   says he is close to convincing Ziller to return to Chel, fulfilling
   Quilan's cover mission.

   The T.S. Eliot poem which the novel takes its name from is, in full:

   Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
   Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
   And the profit and loss.
                                      A current under sea
   Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
   He passed the stages of his age and youth
   Entering the whirlpool.
                                      Gentile or Jew
   O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,
   Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.

   -- T.S. Eliot, The Waste Land, IV. Death by Water

   The fate of Phlebas in the poem is similar to that of Uagen Zlepe in
   the novel. The title may also refer to the state of mind of the Masaq'
   Orbital Hub Mind and Major Quilan, both already having died in spirit
   during their respective wars.
