   Owen is a lonely and bored kid who just moved to the Finger Lakes of
   upstate New York with his father who is a workaholic. His mother
   recently died, and he is trying to find something to do with his summer
   since he does not live in a neighborhood like he used to when he lived
   in Buffalo. One day, while he is running up and down a seven-mile trail
   that he found with his Pointer, Josie. His mother used to talk to him
   about life on other planets, which he wonders about often. When he gets
   by the creek, he finds a piece of cloth with blood on it. He follows a
   trail of footsteps, dirt, and blood to an abandoned house where he
   meets a girl named Campion, (named after a flower) with very shiny
   green eyes who claims she is from another planet. Cam explains her
   parents landed and she got left behind by mistake. She explains the
   blood from a wound she got because of a hubcap that was thrown at her
   by Ray, the boyfriend of Bobbie, the woman who found her. She explains
   that Ray and Bobbi are pursuing her because she escaped from a hotel
   room they kept her in. Cam says she likes Tootsie Rolls, and agrees
   life on Earth really has its points. Owen kindly brings her food,
   water, and supplies. Owen tries to keep Cam a secret from his father,
   and from the "Dog People", a friendly family who has over 19 pets whom
   they walk down the trail daily. (The Dog People, Emie and Charlene,
   explain that they wanted kids, but they never got them. So, they had to
   adopt dogs and cats.) Cam then says she needs him to make a "signal" in
   a wheat field to signal her parents so they can pick her up. Cam tells
   Owen that he needs to hide her for exactly four days, which is when a
   full moon comes, and they search during full moons. But, since they
   have become good friends, Cam asks Owen to come with her, and leave his
   boring life for her planet. Cam and Owen camp out in a tent and talk
   about her home planet. Cam explains her planet was once ravaged with
   war, and they have evolved into smarter beings. She then explains they
   "like dogs" and says Josie can come. Owen starts talking to his father
   and gets excited when he leaves a note saying he will come home early
   so they can talk again. However, his dad is working on a big audit, and
   does not make it. Towards ten o'clock, Owen cries himself to sleep.
   Angry, Owen gets up early the next morning and plows the signal into a
   wheat field with a board. Owen tells Cam he will be coming with her to
   her planet. They anxiously wait for the ship to arrive until Ray shows
   up and attacks them. While Ray is injuring Owen, Cam knocks him
   unconscious with the board they used to plow the field. Cam frantically
   shouts to the sky when she sees lights. However, it is a police
   helicopter searching for Owen. They give themselves up, and Cam reveals
   she was really Bobbi's daughter, but she ran away and imagined being
   from another planet. When Owen believed her, she felt it might be
   possible. In the end, Cam moves in with Ernie and Charlene, and Owen
   begins to talk to his dad. They say they are going on a hike through
   the Adirondack Mountains. The final sentence has Owen say: "Cam said
   life on Earth has its points. And I think she is right."
