   What I Loved opens with a painting of a woman 'wearing only a man's
   T-shirt', with the artist's shadow across the canvas. The protagonist,
   art historian Leon Hertzberg (Leo), purchases the painting and some
   time afterwards befriends the artist, Bill Wechsler. Bill is, at this
   stage, an unknown artist, though as the novel progresses, so too does
   his career in the New York art scene. This is in part due to Leo's
   writing, which brings Bill's work into the public eye. Bill is married
   to Lucille, a highly strung poet, and Leo is married to Erica, a
   literary academic. The two couples become close and move into the same
   apartment block. Erica and Lucille fall pregnant around the same time
   and have sons, Mathew and Mark. The first half of the novel explores
   their quiet, domestic lives, through the eyes of Leo. Lucille and Bill
   separate after he forms a relationship with Violet, the model who posed
   for the painting which opens the text.

   The opening of part Two of the novel is described by Robert Birnbaum,
   in an interview with the author, as like a punch in the face and
   the pace of the novel accelerates after this point. Leo and Erica's
   son, Mathew, dies suddenly. Grief-stricken, Leo eventually loses Erica,
   who moves away for distance as well as work. Leo forms a close
   relationship with Bill's son Mark. Mark is, however, an insincere and
   somewhat amoral character, and a pattern is repeated between the two,
   of trust and betrayal, until Leo and the reader realise Mark is
   probably not capable of affection.

   Mark befriends performance and installation artist Teddy Giles, whose
   art is designed to shock, but seems empty and only designed to serve
   that one purpose. Bill eventually dies in his studio and Violet
   attempts to curtail her grief by cleaning manically. Leo becomes
   embroiled in a thriller-like plot attempting to track down Mark who has
   become lost in Teddy Giles's scene. Leo finally professes his love for
   Violet. She tells him he can have her for one night, but that she's
   then moving away. He declines and returns to his apartment alone.

   A minor character throughout the novel, Lazlo Finkelman, moves amongst
   similar circles to Teddy Giles and Mark, but with very different
   intentions and values. At the close of the novel, an aging Leo finds
   comfort in playing with Lazlo's young son.
