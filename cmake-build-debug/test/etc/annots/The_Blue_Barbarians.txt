   In the Eight Hundredth Millennium the Sun is fading and Earth is
   freezing over. Humanity needs a new home if it is to survive and Venus
   has been chosen for exploration. Seven expeditions have gone to Venus
   and vanished: now the eighth is leaving. Physicist Erom Reve discovers,
   to his dismay, that his traveling companion will be Daolgi Kar, a
   self-styled poet who brings his little dog Tippy.

   Reaching Venus, the men must bail out of their spacecar before meteors
   destroy it. They descend under electric parachutes and then make their
   way across the alien landscape until they come to a city, where they
   are captured and put into a zoo. Over several weeks they learn the
   rudiments of the Venusian language. After convincing the Venusians that
   they are not animals, the two men (with Tippy) are sent to prison for
   entering the nation of Wultho illegally. There they refine their
   knowledge of the local language and customs. After a year Erom and
   Daolgi are sent to work in a sawdust factory.

   Daolgi's inattention to his job leads to a fire that burns down the
   sawdust factory. In the confusion the two men and Tippy escape from the
   city and take refuge in the countryside. They end up living in a cave
   by the sea and Erom struggles to make green glass, the highest
   denomination of Venusian currency. When he succeeds in making two large
   chunks of it, he and Daolgi go to a village. They are given a hostile
   reception as vagabonds until Erom displays some green glass, then the
   villagers welcome him and Daolgi as Large Letter Men.

   When the Earthmen hear rumors of white-skinned giants terrorizing a
   distant continent, Erom arranges an expedition by airship to
   investigate his suspicion that the monsters are actually members of the
   previous expeditions from Earth. They arrive at a Wulthonian outpost
   and plunge into the jungle, where they find a small hamlet occupied by
   humans. Using a crude wireless telegraph, the explorers have gathered
   in all of the expeditions as they crash-landed on Venus and now they
   live in peace with their neighbors. Having already established himself
   as the owner of a town in Wultho, Erom convinces the others to come
   back with him and possibly find a way to contact Earth.

   With the help of two of the others, Erom returns to the seaside cave
   and makes a large quantity of green glass. He uses the new wealth to
   become the richest and most powerful man on Venus. Working in secret,
   Erom has a set of new spacecars built for him and his friends and he
   builds a radio capable of communicating with Earth. A foreign dignitary
   comes to his town and one of his companions inadvertently insults him,
   thereby triggering a planetwide war. Their greed for colored glass
   exceeded only by their eagerness to slaughter each other, the Venusians
   use a newly invented death ray in their orgy of self-annihilation. The
   humans, in their spacecars, head back to Earth to prepare for
   Humanity's move to soon-to-be-depopulated Venus.
