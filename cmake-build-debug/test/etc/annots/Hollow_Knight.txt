   At the outset of the game, the Knight (the player character) arrives at
   the ruined remains of Hallownest, a vast, ancient kingdom just below a
   grubby town called Dirtmouth. As the Knight ventures through the ruins,
   they discover that Hallownest was once a flourishing kingdom which fell
   to ruin after becoming overrun with "The Infection", which drove its
   citizens to madness and undeath. The first and last ruler of
   Hallownest, the Pale King, attempted to seal away the Infection;
   however, it becomes increasingly clear that the seal is failing. The
   knight's mission is to find and kill the three Dreamers who act as
   living locks to the seal. This quest brings the Knight into conflict
   with Hornet, a female warrior who acts as the protector of Hallownest
   who tests the Knight's resolve in several battles.

   Through dialogue with certain characters as well as cutscenes, the
   Knight receives insight into the origin of the Infection and itself. In
   ancient times, the bugs of Hallownest worshipped a higher being called
   the Radiance: a primordial, mothlike creature whose mere presence could
   sway the denizens of Hallownest to mindless obedience. One day, another
   higher being called The Pale King arrived at Hallownest and used his
   power to "free" the minds of the bugs of Hallownest, granting them
   sapience. Thankful for the minds they had been given, the bugs of
   Hallownest revered and worshipped the Pale King, causing The Radiance
   to fall into obscurity. This allowed him to establish the grand kingdom
   of Hallownest.

   Hallownest prospered until the Radiance, having been kept alive via
   hushed whispers of faith, began invading the dreams of Hallownest's
   citizens, driving them to madness in the form of an affliction known as
   The Infection. In an attempt to contain the spreading Infection, the
   Pale King used the power of Void (a sort of living darkness found in an
   area known as The Abyss) to create the Vessels: completely hollow
   beings that would hypothetically lack a will which could be corrupted
   by The Infection. The process of creating these vessels involved much
   trial and error, which resulted in an innumerable number of dead vessel
   shells locked away in The Abyss. Eventually the Pale King chose what he
   found to be the most suitable Vessel, deemed it the Hollow Knight, and
   trained it to contain the Infection. He then sealed the Hollow Knight
   within the Temple of the Black Egg with the aid of the three Dreamers.
   However, the Hollow Knight was not able to hold The Radiance as it had
   been tarnished by an "idea instilled", presumably its parental bond
   with the Pale King, effectively compromising the seal and causing the
   infection to rage on.

   Depending on the player's actions, "Hollow Knight" has multiple
   endings. In the first ending, "Hollow Knight", the Knight defeats the
   Hollow Knight and takes its place in the Temple of the Black Egg,
   though the Radiance still survives. The second ending, "Sealed
   Siblings", occurs if the player collects the Void Heart charm before
   fighting the Hollow Knight: this is roughly similar to the first
   ending, except Hornet arrives to help during the final battle and is
   sealed with the Knight, becoming the Dreamer that locks the door.

   The third ending, "Dream No More", occurs if the player collects the
   Void Heart and uses the Awakened Dream Nail (a weapon that allows the
   player to see the thoughts and dreams of various NPCS) to gain entry to
   the Hollow Knight's dreams when Hornet arrives to help. This allows the
   Knight to challenge the Radiance directly. The battle ends when the
   Knight commands the complete power of the Void and the remaining
   Vessels to consume the Radiance utterly and thus end the threat of the
   Infection, though the Knight is destroyed in the process, leaving
   behind their shell split in two.
