   Ted Baker is beginning his fourth year at the Space Academy, which is
   to take place on the Earth orbiting space station. On his trip to the
   station from Earth, he is accompanied by a recent graduate of the
   Academy, Jack Talbot, who is to be part of the first expedition to the
   Moon as a backup member. On arrival at the station, Ted discovers that
   Jack's collarbone was injured during the launch to the station. Fearing
   that Jack's injury could endanger the other men on the expedition, he
   confronts Jack about his injury. Jack refuses to give up his chance at
   glory, forcing Ted into a physical confrontation. Jack is knocked
   unconscious, and Ted hurriedly boards the moon rocket to inform the
   expedition of Jack's injury. Unfortunately, the countdown has already
   begun, and cannot be stopped. Ted is now the fifth man of the
   expedition.
