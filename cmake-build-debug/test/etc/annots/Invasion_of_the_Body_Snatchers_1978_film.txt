   A species of gelatinous creatures, having abandoned their dying planet
   and traveled to Earth, land in San Francisco. They infiltrate Earth's
   ecosystem, latching onto plant life and taking the form of small pods
   with fragrant pink flowers. Elizabeth Driscoll, a laboratory scientist
   at the San Francisco Health Department, brings one of the flowers home,
   where she lives with her boyfriend, Geoffrey. Leaving the flower on
   their bedside table, she awakens the next morning to discover Geoffrey
   behaving strangely cold and distant.

   Elizabeth's colleague, Matthew Bennell, suggests she speak to his
   psychiatrist friend, David Kibner, who is holding a book-signing party
   to promote his new self-help book. As Elizabeth and Matthew drive to
   the bookstore, a hysterical man on the road screams to them, shouting
   "They're coming! You'll be next!" before being chased away by a mob of
   people and then hit by a car. At the bookstore, while Matthew tries to
   report the accident to apparently unbelieving authorities, Elizabeth
   asks David for help regarding Geoffrey. David theorizes that people are
   using various pretexts to cope with their highly stressed lives, and
   suggests that Elizabeth is simply using the belief that Geoffrey is
   behaving differently as an excuse to end their relationship. Despite
   other people having also complained that their loved ones had become
   strange, she contemplates that David may be right. Meanwhile, Matthew's
   friend, Jack Bellicec, calls Matthew to investigate when a grotesque
   body covered in fibers, which resembles Jack, is found in his wife
   Nancy's mud baths. Sensing danger with these odd occurrences, Matthew
   goes to Elizabeth to warn her. After breaking into her house, he finds
   Elizabeth in a deep sleep, but also discovers a semi-formed duplicate
   of her in the bedroom. Suspecting Geoffrey's involvement, Matthew takes
   Elizabeth home with him, but when he returns later with the police, the
   duplicate body is gone.

   The following night, Matthew and his friends are nearly duplicated as
   they sleep, by four pods in Matthew's garden. The aliens gestate inside
   the pods, which grow to around 3 ft (1 m) in length before breaking
   open and spawning a human duplicate that grows rapidly. The pods
   duplicate humans while they are sleeping in the immediate vicinity,
   copying not just their physical characteristics, but also their
   memories. Once the duplication is complete, the original human dies and
   disintegrates, and the alien "pod person" takes their place. Matthew
   calls the police, but soon realizes that the department has been
   infiltrated. They have also begun tracking him through the phone lines,
   alerting others to the group's location. Matthew destroys his own
   semi-formed duplicate before escaping with the others, pursued by the
   aliens, who emit a shrill scream when they discover a human being among
   them, drawing other aliens nearby. Cornered at a dead-end road, Jack
   and Nancy break away and create a distraction, allowing Matthew and
   Elizabeth to hide and eventually escape back into the city. There, the
   pair takes refuge in the health department, where they each ingest a
   large dose of speed to prevent themselves from falling asleep. Again
   tracked through the phone lines, they are soon captured by Jack and
   David, who have been duplicated. Matthew and Elizabeth are injected
   with sedatives while being told of the aliens' intentions for
   survivability, but because of their previous speed consumption they do
   not fall asleep. They are able to kill Jack's duplicate and lock David
   in a refrigerated room, and escape.

   Matthew and Elizabeth reunite with Nancy, who has learned to evade the
   aliens by hiding her emotions and blending in with them. The two follow
   her example, but their cover is blown when Elizabeth screams at the
   sight of a mutant dog with a human head. They separate from Nancy amid
   the chaos, and quickly board a truck en route to Pier 70, where the
   aliens are cultivating more pods, intending to transport them to other
   cities. Matthew scouts around for a way to flee the area, but the ship
   he hopes they can get away on is also revealed to be carrying pods to
   distant locations. Matthew returns to Elizabeth, but she has fallen
   asleep and when he embraces her she disintegrates in his arms. Moments
   later the naked body of a duplicated Elizabeth appears, and she speaks
   enticingly to him to try to get him to join her. Pursued by the
   shrieking duplicate Elizabeth, he breaks into the docks' warehouse and
   burns down the building, destroying hundreds of pods. He flees and
   hides under a bridge, exhausted, as the aliens try to find him. One of
   his pursuers tells another he has to fall asleep eventually.

   Matthew, walking like an alien and showing no outward signs of emotion,
   returns to work at the health department. He watches several
   schoolchildren being taken for duplication, and more pods being
   prepared for the remaining West Coast cities.
   In the final scene, Matthew (Donald Sutherland) demonstrates the
   characteristic pose by which the "pod people" identify unconverted
   humans.

   At the end of the day as he heads towards City Hall he hears his name
   being called. Nancy, still on the loose, quietly approaches him and
   attempts a hushed conversation. To her horror he points at her and
   emits an earsplitting shriek. He has been replaced by a pod.
