   The novel takes place in a world somewhat parallel to Earth, in the
   year Seventeen-Twelvety, which is equivalent to approximately 1802 in
   Earth years. The main character is sixteen-year-old Artemesia
   Fitz-Willoghby Weatherhouse, who is an amnesiac student at the Angels
   Academy of Young Maidens. On the afternoon of Christmas Eve, while
   practising deportment, she tumbles down the stairs and hits her head on
   the banister, restoring her memories from six years previous - of her
   life aboard a pirate ship led by her mother, Molly Faith, more commonly
   known as Piratica, until a misfired cannon caused Molly's death and
   Artemesia's amnesia.

   Her sudden change in behaviour and into men's clothing due to the
   restoration of her memories convince her teachers and fellow students
   that she is mad, and she is locked in a room for safety. She quickly
   escapes up the chimney and sets off to locate her mother's former crew
   members. On the way she meets Felix Phoenix, a traveller, and forces
   him to trade clothes with her. She locks him in a sooty, abandoned
   house and continues on her way.

   From there, she locates some of her mother's old 'crew' and commandeers
   a ship. When she meets them they all think it is her mother Molly. She
   finds out that they advertise coffee and have a small ship. Heading out
   the stop at a town where they show her a theatre. They then explain to
   her that her mother and themselves were only actors and not pirates.
   Confused Art makes a plan to become the REAL Piratica, and sail the
   seas. She holds by her mother's (stage) code of honour- she steals by
   guile and trickery, and never takes a life. When stealing a boat Felix
   Phoenix joins them. Together they set out to find a mysterious treasure
   isle.^[1]
