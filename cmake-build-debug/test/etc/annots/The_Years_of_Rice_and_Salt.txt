   At the time of publication in 2002, science fiction author Kim Stanley
   Robinson was 49 years old and living in Davis, California. He had
   conceived of the premise for The Years of Rice and Salt in the 1970s
   while thinking about what alternate history scenario would result in
   "the biggest change that would still work in terms of comparison to our
   history". He subsequently developed an interest in China and in
   Buddhism, which he would study for this project.

   Robinson's only other alternate history story prior to this project was
   the short story "The Lucky Strike" (1984), where the Enola Gay
   crashes in a training exercise and the secondary crew must complete the
   Hiroshima bombing.

   Robinson also wrote an essay titled "A Sensitive Dependence on Initial
   Conditions" (1991), comparing different theories of history and
   laws of science, such as the covering law model, to explain how
   alternate histories can be arrived at, using "The Lucky Strike" as an
   example.

   He explored the idea of non-Western influences creating a new culture
   while working on his Mars trilogy, which involved a heavy Muslim
   influence in a Martian colony. The Mars trilogy gave Robinson a
   reputation for quality of writing and a richness of detail comparable
   to James Michener, as well as winning him a Nebula Award for Red
   Mars (1993) and two Hugo and Locus Awards for Green Mars (1994) and
   Blue Mars (1996). Robinson followed the Mars trilogy with the novel
   Antarctica (1997), which won an Alex Award, and two short story
   collections, The Martians (1999) and Vinland the Dream (2001), before
   publishing The Years of Rice and Salt.
