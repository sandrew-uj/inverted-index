   Mega-City One is filled with 400 million people, each holding the
   potential for criminal activity. Judge Dredd is the city's law
   enforcer, respected by all Judges and feared by all crooks. The Psi
   Judges sense a horrible plague approaching the city, and the Dark
   Judges are their prime suspects. The release of viruses that change the
   host into a "Vampire" or a "Zombie" is blamed on Dr. Icarus and Judge
   Death. Judge Dredd is forced to fight the insane Dr. Icarus (who almost
   becomes immortal, his original plan was to find a way to become
   immortal, not make vampires) and the Dark Judges. The last time Dredd
   fights Death, Death uses Icarus's immortal body to fight Dredd, but is
   ultimately defeated and Death flees into Judge Anderson's body, who had
   been held there against her will.
