   In 2001, a virus has killed 99% of the female population of Earth.
   Various countries fight over each other's quarantine zones, and end up
   engaging in nuclear war, destroying much of civilization. The few
   remaining women (called Queenlords) are held by gangs who have taken
   over small pieces of the world. The main character, Griffin Spade, had
   his fiancee Madison taken away from Queens, New York by the U.S.
   government. Griffin ends up separated from his fiancee, and New York
   City is destroyed. He claims a tank for his own and sets out to cross
   the United States to find her, battling gangs as he reaches his goal.
   After surviving the ruins of New York City, Griffin heads westward
   gaining recruits in the countryside, Chicago, Las Vegas, and San
   Francisco.
