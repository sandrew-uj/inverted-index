   Nora Grey is an average sophomore student living in Coldwater, Maine.
   Her life is largely uneventful until she is seated next to a mysterious
   senior named Patch Cipriano in biology class, who had failed the
   subject several times before. The two are initially at odds, but Nora
   finds herself inexplicably drawn to him, his behavior both attractive
   and repelling. Despite the strong pull she feels towards him, Nora
   continues to tell her best friend Vee that she's not interested in
   Patch.

   Vee later invites Nora to a local amusement park, Delphic, in an
   attempt to set her up with Elliot, a boy who has expressed an
   attraction to Nora. The trip turns awkward when the group runs into
   Patch, who makes Elliot jealous. Nora confronts Patch and he persuades
   Nora to meet him in front of the newly reformed roller coaster, the
   Archangel. Nora later makes an excuse to find something to eat and sets
   off to find Patch.

   After she finds Patch, he manages to persuade her to ride the
   Archangel. The ride turns into a disaster after Nora falls from the
   roller coaster, only to realize it was her imagination. The incident
   leaves her shaken up. When Nora is unable to locate Vee and the others
   at the amusement park, she is left with no option but to allow Patch to
   drive her home. Once home, Patch offers to make tacos. Nora becomes
   suspicious and worried as the knife he uses changes sizes. The two
   nearly kiss but are interrupted by her mom calling in an attempt to
   check on Nora.

   Nora becomes increasingly more connected with Patch and begins to
   change her opinion of him, especially after meeting his closest and
   only friend Rixon. Meanwhile, she also begins to grow more curious and
   suspicious of Elliot after discovering his involvement in a murder case
   in his last school.

   Nora becomes extremely afraid after a bag lady is murdered in front of
   her. She'd given the woman her coat and hat in exchange for directions.
   She calls Patch for a ride home due to the rain and her fear, but his
   Jeep breaks down partway through and the pair are forced to take
   shelter in a shabby motel. While in the room, Nora finds that Patch has
   an upside down V on his back, which she earlier thought was her
   imagination during a play fight between Rixon and Patch at Bo's Arcade.
   Fascinated by it, she manages to touch the scar and is pulled into his
   memories of his past. This prompts Patch to demand to know what she had
   seen, and Nora to demand answers about what she has seen. This leads to
   the revelation that Patch is actually a fallen angel from Heaven who
   was trying to kill her, and in doing so, gain a human body. Her death
   would kill his Nephilim vassal Chauncey Langeais and make Patch
   completely human. She also discovers that Patch has an ex-girlfriend
   named Dabria, who is also Nora's new counselor at school, an angel of
   death who wants Patch to save Nora's life so he can become a guardian
   angel and so he can get back together with her. Patch had initially
   discarded Dabria's idea out of a desire to become human, but the plan
   failed because he had fallen in love with Nora.

   It is soon revealed that her friend Jules is actually Chauncey, who
   wants revenge on Patch for tricking him into swearing an oath that will
   allow Patch to take over his body during the Jewish month of Cheshvan.
   After leaving the motel and going home, Dabria breaks into Nora's room
   and says that she wants to kill Nora in order to prevent Patch from
   doing so and becoming human. Nora is narrowly saved by Patch, who goes
   after Dabria and strips her of her wings in vengeance, already knowing
   the archangels would have done the same for trying to kill Nora.

   Nora is later invited to a game of hide-and-seek with Vee, Jules, and
   Elliot, with Elliot hinting that Vee will not survive the game if Nora
   doesn't participate. Despite Patch attempting to get her to remain
   behind in the car, Nora goes after them. She soon discovers Jules'
   unmoving body, presuming Elliot killed him, only to be cornered by
   Jules, who confesses that he was behind various attacks on her life as
   a way of getting revenge on Patch. The game continues as they are held
   at gunpoint by Jules.

   Nora struggles with Jules while Patch tries to distract him, but this
   fails and Patch is forced to possess Nora's body to fight him. The
   process leaves Patch unconscious after he's separated from her body
   because it is not the month of Cheshvan. In an attempt to escape, Nora
   climbs to the rafters of the school gym, but Jules uses mind tricks to
   make her believe that the ladders are breaking and that she is going to
   fall to her death. Patch manages to break through the tricks by making
   her focus on his voice in her mind. Jules begins to climb the ladder
   after her, but Nora confronts him with the knowledge that if she were
   to sacrifice her life, Patch would become human and Jules would die.
   With this in mind, Nora throws herself from the rafters, which
   effectively kills Jules.

   To her surprise, Nora wakes up alive and well. Patch explains that he
   did not take her sacrifice because there was no point in having a human
   body without her. In doing so, Patch has saved Nora's life and is now
   her guardian angel. The two share a romantic moment, ending the book.
