   Shortly after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a major earthquake hits Japan.
   Amidst the chaos, the Mutou siblings Ayumu (a middle school student and
   track and field athlete) and her younger brother Gou (an elementary
   schooler and video game enthusiast) attempt to escape the city with
   their family and friends. However, the sinking Japanese archipelago
   complicates their escape. Plunged into extreme conditions, the Mutou
   siblings believe in the future and acquire the strength to survive with
   utmost effort.
