   While walking down the street in Chicago, Joseph Schwartz, a retired
   tailor, is the unwitting victim of a nearby nuclear laboratory
   accident, by means of which he is instantaneously transported tens of
   thousands of years into the future (50,000 years, by one character's
   estimate, a figure later retconned by future Asimov works as a
   "mistake"). He finds himself in a place he does not recognize, and due
   to apparent changes in the spoken language that far into the future, he
   is unable to communicate with anyone. He wanders into a farm, and is
   taken in by the couple that lives there. They mistake him for a
   mentally deficient person, and they secretly offer him as a subject for
   an experimental procedure to increase his mental abilities. The
   procedure, which has killed several subjects, works in his case, and he
   finds that he can quickly learn to speak the current lingua franca. He
   also slowly realizes that the procedure has given him strong telepathic
   abilities, including the ability to project his thoughts to the point
   of killing or injuring a person.

   The Earth, at this time, is seen by the rest of the Galactic Empire as
   a rebellious planet -- it has rebelled three times in the past -- and
   the inhabitants are widely frowned upon and discriminated against.
   Earth also has several large radioactive areas, although the cause is
   never really described. With large uninhabitable areas, it is a very
   poor planet, and anyone who is unable to work is legally required to be
   euthanized. The people of the Earth must also be executed when they
   reach the age of sixty, a procedure known as "The Sixty", with very few
   exceptions; mainly for people who have made significant contributions
   to society. That is a problem for Schwartz, who is now sixty-two years
   old.

   The Earth is part of the Trantorian Galactic Empire, with a resident
   Procurator, who lives in a domed town in the high Himalayas and a
   Galactic military garrison, but in practice it is ruled by a group of
   Earth-centered "religious fanatics" who believe in the ultimate
   superiority of Earthlings. They have created a new, deadly supervirus
   that they plan to use to kill or subjugate the rest of the Empire, and
   to avenge themselves for the way their planet has been treated by the
   galaxy at large. Citizens of the Empire are unaware of Earth's lethal
   viruses, and mistakenly believe it is Earth's environment that causes
   them "Radiation Fever," and that Earthlings pose the Empire no threat.

   Joseph Schwartz, along with Affret Shekt, the scientist who developed
   the new device that boosted Schwartz's mental powers, his daughter Pola
   Shekt, and a visiting archaeologist Bel Arvardan, are captured by the
   rebels, but they escape with the help of Schwartz's new mental
   abilities, and they are narrowly able to stop the plan to release the
   virus. Schwartz uses his mental abilities to provoke a pilot from the
   Imperial garrison into bombing the site where the arsenal of the
   super-virus exists.

   The book ends on a hopeful note -- perhaps the Empire can be persuaded
   to restore the Earth and reintroduce uncontaminated soil.
