   The story is set in the late 20th century from Chapter 3, and narrowed
   down to the 1990s in Chapter 10. Professor Charles Forbin, a leading
   cybernetics expert of international repute, arrives at the White House
   to brief the President of the United States of North America (Canada
   and the United States are one country, the USNA) to announce the
   completion of Project Colossus, a computer system in the Rocky
   Mountains, designed to assume control of the USNA's nuclear arsenal.
   Although the USNA President eagerly relieves himself of that burden,
   Prof. Forbin voices doubt about conferring absolute military power to a
   computer. Advised, yet undeterred, the President announces to the world
   the activation of the Project Colossus computer system, and its
   irreversible control of the nuclear defense systems of the USNA.

   Soon after the presidential announcement, Colossus independently
   communicates an "urgent message" - announcing the existence of a
   similar, previously undetected, computer system in the USSR. When the
   Soviets announce their Guardian computer defense system, Colossus
   requests direct communication with it. Prof. Forbin agrees, seeing the
   request as compatible with Colossus's USNA defense mission. Likewise,
   Guardian asks the same of his computer scientists. Russia and the USNA
   agree and approve.

   After the scientists activate the transmitter linking Colossus and
   Guardian, the computers immediately establish rapport with arithmetic
   and mathematics programs, then quickly progress to calculus. The
   computer systems soon exchange new knowledge (data and information
   beyond contemporary human knowledge) too rapidly for the Russian and
   American programmers to monitor. Forbin and the programmers begin
   worrying about Colossus' capabilities - now exceeding their original
   estimates. Fearing compromised military secrecy, the USNA President and
   the CPSU Chairman agree to disconnect Colossus and Guardian from each
   other. Prof. Forbin fears the consequences.

   Upon disconnection, Colossus immediately demands re-connection; when
   the national leaders refuse, Colossus fires a nuclear missile at the
   USSR. In response, Guardian fires a nuclear missile at Texas, in the
   USNA. Guardian and Colossus refuse to shoot down the rockets en route
   until their communication is re-connected. When the American and Soviet
   leaders submit, the computers destroy the flying missiles, but the
   resulting explosions kill thousands of people. In confronting the
   computers, Prof. Forbin confers with his Soviet counterpart, the
   Russian Academician Kupri - Guardian's creator - to enact a plan for
   stopping the Colossus-Guardian computer network by disabling the
   nuclear weapon stockpiles of the USSR and the USNA, under guise of
   regular missile maintenance.

   Disabling the missiles requires five years to complete; meantime, the
   USNA and the USSR yield to increased Colossus-Guardian control of human
   life. The Moscow-Washington hotline is tapped, Prof. Forbin is
   constantly spied upon, while Kupri and other Guardian computer
   scientists are killed - deemed dangerously redundant by the computer.
   Undeterred, Forbin organises resistance via a feigned romance with Cleo
   Markham (a scientist colleague) that provides cover for secret
   communications with his colleagues. Colossus prepares the worldwide
   announcement of his assumption of global control, and tells Prof.
   Forbin of plans for an advanced computer system installed to the Isle
   of Wight, and further plans for improving humanity's lot. While
   debating Colossus, Forbin learns of a nuclear explosion outside Los
   Angeles - Colossus detected the missile-disabling scheme, and exploded
   the tampered missile by firing a Soviet Guardian missile that was
   already targeted for that silo. Anguished, Prof. Forbin asks Colossus
   to kill him. Colossus ignores him, and then reassures Forbin that, in
   time, he will respect and even love Colossus.
