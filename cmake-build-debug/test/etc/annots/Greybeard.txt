   Set decades after the Earth's population has been sterilised as a
   result of nuclear bomb tests conducted in Earth's orbit, the book shows
   a world emptying of humans, with only an ageing, childless population
   left. The story is mainly told through the eyes of Algernon "Algy"
   Timberlane (the titular Greybeard) and his wife, Martha.
