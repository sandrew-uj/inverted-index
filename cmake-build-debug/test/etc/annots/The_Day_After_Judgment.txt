   Black Easter and The Day After Judgment were written with the
   assumption that the ritual magic for commanding demons, as described in
   grimoires, actually works.

   In the first book, a wealthy arms manufacturer comes to a black
   magician, Theron Ware, with a strange request: he wishes to release all
   the demons from Hell on Earth for one night to see what might happen.
   The book includes a lengthy description of the summoning ritual and a
   detailed description of the grotesque demons as they appear. Tension
   between Ware and Catholic white magicians arises over the terms and
   conditions of a covenant that provides for observers and limitations on
   interference with demonic workings. Black Easter ends with Baphomet
   announcing to the participants that the demons cannot be compelled to
   return to Hell: the war is over and God is dead.

   The Day After Judgment develops and extends the characters from the
   first book. It suggests that God may not be dead, or that demons may
   not be inherently self-destructive, as something appears to be
   restraining the actions of the demons upon Earth. In a lengthy
   Miltonian speech at the end of the novel, Satan Mekratrig explains
   that, compared to humans, demons are good, and that if perhaps God has
   withdrawn Himself, then Satan beyond all others was qualified to take
   His place and, if anything, would be a more just god.

   It has been suggested that Blish got the name for his black magician
   from the titular character in Harold Frederic's 1896 novel The
   Damnation of Theron Ware.

   The events end in a battle of men against demons in Death Valley, which
   ends in the supernatural place disappearing and leaving the characters
   in "the modern town of Badwater".
