   The novel tells the stories, primarily, of four people living in
   Manhattan from the 1890s to the late 1920s. The stories are presented
   in a fragmented, contrasting way, often juxtaposing them to bring out
   new meaning. The title of the book refers to a railway station, and the
   way that Manhattan itself was undergoing change.

   The primary characters and stories include:
     * Ellen Thatcher--Ellen's father is an accountant and her early life
       was one of genteel poverty. She aspires to become an actress, which
       is not socially acceptable to her parents and their peers. Early in
       her story, Ellen becomes successful, but success brings with it
       hundreds of rich and famous suitors and she struggles to determine
       who is sincere and who is not. Eventually, she marries John "Jojo"
       Oglethorpe, a fellow actor. Ellen engages in numerous affairs,
       which Oglethorpe tolerates. The Panic of 1896 devastates the local
       economy. Ellen meets Stan Emery, a wealthy student at Harvard
       University who has dropped out due to alcoholism, and they begin an
       affair. Oglethorpe finally snaps, and stands outside Stan's
       apartment building one night screaming in a drunken fury. Stan ends
       his relationship with Ellen and marries another girl. Shortly
       thereafter, he commits suicide by setting himself on fire. Ellen
       learns she is pregnant with Stan's baby. Although Stan is the only
       person she ever truly loved, in her fury she has an abortion. Her
       story then intersects with that of Jimmy Herf.

     * Bud Korpenning--Born to a farming family in upstate New York, he
       kills his abusive father. He takes a riverboat down the Hudson
       River to New York City, where he hopes to escape justice by
       becoming one of the anonymous millions in the city. Isolation,
       unemployment, poverty, and starvation take their toll on him. He
       becomes increasingly paranoid, believing the police to be on his
       trail. He commits suicide by throwing himself off a bridge.

       decides to represent Gus. George begins an affair with Gus' wife,
       Nellie. Gus wins his lawsuit and becomes wealthy. George, however,
       fails to capitalize on the lawsuit and his practice still
       struggles. He loses interest in Nellie, and becomes infatuated with
       actress Ellen Thatcher. Ellen flirts with him at a bar. When she
       admits she only flirted with him for her own amusement, George
       threatens her with a pistol. His wife, Cecily, tired of his endless
       philandering, divorces him. After World War I ends, Gus, who is now
       a radical journalist, urges George to run for office. George
       refuses repeatedly, and then decides to run for office as a
       reformer. This enrages the radical Gus. After her divorce from
       Jimmy Herf, Ellen Thatcher marries George.
