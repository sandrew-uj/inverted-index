   Harriet and her family are spending their summer in the beach town of
   Water Mill (which is on Long Island). Her summertime friend, Beth
   Ellen, sometimes called Mouse, is also in Water Mill with her
   grandmother. Mysterious anonymous notes start showing up all over town;
   they have a religious slant and expose the faults of the recipients.
   Harriet is determined to find out who is leaving them. She suspects
   anyone who reads the Bible.

   Harriet drags Beth Ellen along on spying expeditions directed against
   Bunny, the piano-playing manager of the local hotel, and the Jenkinses,
   an eccentric southern family preoccupied with money-making schemes.
   Harriet's friend Janie and Mrs Plumber from Harriet the Spy also
   appear.

   Beth Ellen learns that her mother, who left when she was five, is
   returning from Europe with her new husband. Her grandmother expects
   Beth Ellen to be excited by the news but she is indifferent. Her mother
   Zeeney turns out to be a beautiful but shallow socialite who is
   dissatisfied with her shy and serious daughter. Beth Ellen's dislike of
   her mother finally explodes in a temper tantrum which clears her head,
   leaving her happier and more confident.
