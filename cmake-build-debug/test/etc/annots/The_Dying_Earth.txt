   The Dying Earth is a collection of fantasy short fiction by American
   writer Jack Vance, published by Hillman in 1950. Vance returned to the
   setting in 1965 and thereafter, making it the first book in the Dying
   Earth series. It is retitled Mazirian the Magician in its Vance
   Integral Edition (2005),^[1] after the second of six collected stories.

   The Internet Speculative Fiction Database calls it a "slightly
   connected series of stories" but it was ranked number 16 of 33 "All
   Time Best Fantasy Novels" by Locus in 1987, based on a poll of
   subscribers.^[1] Similarly, it was one of five finalists for the Best
   Novel "Retro Hugo" in 2001^[1] when the World Science Fiction Society
   provided 50th anniversary recognition for a publication year without
   Hugo Awards.
