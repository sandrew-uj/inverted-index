   As the story opens, the Austin family has settled in a New York City
   apartment after the events of The Moon by Night, and made some friends;
   blind young pianist Emily Gregory and Josiah "Dave" Davidson, who helps
   Emily get around. Emily is studying under the tutelage of the
   passionate, leonine Emmanuel Theotocopulous, better known as Mr. Theo.
   Canon Tallis, newly arrived at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine
   after the events of The Arm of the Starfish, meets the Austin children
   and their friends just as they encounter an anachronistic Genie in a
   junk shop. Tallis advises and helps to protect the children as they are
   drawn into a mystery involving the Genie, a street gang called the
   Alphabats, and the local bishop's strange behavior.

   Dave is skeptical of the Genie, as is Suzy Austin, but the others are
   not sure. Centralized, single-minded activity on the part of the
   criminal Alphabats excites the suspicion of Canon Tallis, who
   interrogates Dave and Dr. Wallace Austin. Dr. Austin has been working
   on the creation and perfection of a laser-based Micro-Ray, which is so
   unerringly precise that it may do more than simply penetrate the
   corporeal. Dave was once a member of the Alphabats, but has turned from
   their ways. He is in denial of his past, not even talking about it.
   Tension builds as the 'Bats try to draw Dave into their new mischief,
   whose mastermind is none other than the Bishop himself. The Genie
   appears to be the bishop's servant, and also appears to possess a
   Micro-Ray.

   It is revealed that the bishop has given up hope for the world; that he
   hopes to establish a state of control over humanity, whereby he may
   prevent anything he deems detrimental to its success. His Genie,
   Hythloday, uses the Micro-Ray to control the Alphabats. A concentrated
   beam from it stimulates the brain's pleasure center, giving the victim
   a feeling of flight. The Alphabats, hoping to receive more of this
   pleasure as a reward, carry out the bishop's demands.

   Eventually, Rob Austin is captured. Vicky and Emily track him to the
   Cathedral, where they are joined by Vicky's family, Canon Tallis, and
   Mr. Theotocopulous. The united group expose the bishop as an imposter,
   being the original bishop's brother, actor Henry Grandcourt; break
   apart his plans to seize power; and unmask Hythloday as the dishonest
   scientist Dr. Hyde. The Micro-Ray is seized. Dave makes his peace with
   both his past and future, coming eventually to look upon those who have
   been with him as his family.
