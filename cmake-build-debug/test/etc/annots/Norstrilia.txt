   Norstrilia is a science fiction novel published by Paul Linebarger
   under the pseudonym Cordwainer Smith. It is the only novel he published
   under this name, which he used for his science fiction works (though
   several related short stories were once packaged together as a short
   novel Quest of the Three Worlds). It takes place in Smith's
   Instrumentality of Mankind universe, and was heavily influenced by the
   classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. The novel is in part a
   sequel to Smith's 1962 short story "The Ballad of Lost C'Mell",
   featuring some of the same characters and settings.
