   In 1801 the British have risen to power in Egypt and suppress the
   worship of the old Egyptian gods. A cabal of magicians plan to drive
   the British out of Egypt by bringing the gods forward in time from an
   age when they were still powerful and unleashing them on London,
   thereby destroying the British Empire. In 1802, a failed attempt by the
   magicians to summon Anubis opens magical gates in a predictable pattern
   across time and space.

   In 1983, ailing millionaire J. Cochran Darrow has discovered the gates
   and found that they make time travel possible. Darrow organizes a trip
   to the past for fellow millionaires to attend a lecture by Samuel
   Taylor Coleridge in 1810. He hires Professor Brendan Doyle to attend
   and give expert commentary. One of the magicians, Doctor Romany,
   happens to spy the time travelers and kidnaps Doyle before he can
   return. Doyle manages to escape torture and flees back to London, now
   trapped in the 19th century.

   Doyle joins a beggars' guild and meets a beggar named Jacky. He plans
   to meet and befriend William Ashbless, a wealthy poet that Doyle has
   studied profusely, in order to gain a benefactor. Doctor Romany scours
   the city for Doyle with his legion of murderous beggars, led by the
   clown-magician Horrabin. At the same time, Doyle discovers that Darrow
   has remained in the 19th century to search for Dog-Face Joe, a
   body-swapping werewolf, in hopes of bribing Joe into granting him a
   healthy new body. Doyle himself becomes targeted by Joe, receiving the
   poisoned body of Darrow's former bodyguard, but manages to cure himself
   of the poison.

   In his new body, Doyle realizes that he himself is the historical
   Ashbless. He copies down Ashbless's poetry from memory and deduces his
   own future from his study of Ashbless's life. Using this knowledge, he
   continues to thwart the magicians' plans. After Romany discovers a gate
   to 1684, Doyle follows him through and stops his attempt to change the
   past. Meanwhile, Darrow successfully contacts Dog-Face Joe and
   organizes a deal in which Joe will provide Darrow with healthy bodies
   and allow him to live forever.

   Doyle eventually returns to 1810, but is kidnapped and taken to
   Muhammad Ali's Egypt, where the magicians' Master tempts him with
   resurrecting his dead wife if he will tell them the secrets of the
   time-gates. Doyle resists and kills the Master. Meanwhile, Jacky
   discovers Darrow's secret and kills him along with Dog-Face Joe. Doyle
   returns to London, where the last magician, Romanelli, kidnaps him,
   Jacky, and Coleridge. In a drugged stupor, Coleridge frees Horrabin's
   twisted menagerie of monsters, allowing him and Jacky to escape.
   Romanelli escapes with Doyle to the underworld, but is eaten by Apep
   while Doyle is rejuvenated on board the sunboat of the god Ra. Doyle
   meets back up with Jacky and discovers that not only is Jacky secretly
   a woman, she is his future wife.

   Decades later, after living out Ashbless's entire life and becoming a
   widower, Doyle goes out to meet his historic date with death. Doyle
   discovers that his intended murderer is a duplicate of himself that the
   Master had made in Egypt decades before. Doyle kills the duplicate,
   thereby supplying the corpse for his death, and boats away into an
   unknown future.
