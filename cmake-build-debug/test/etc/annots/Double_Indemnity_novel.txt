   Walter Huff, an insurance agent, falls for the married Phyllis
   Nirdlinger, who consults him about accident insurance for her
   unsuspecting husband. In spite of his instinctual decency, and
   intrigued by the challenge of committing the perfect murder, Walter is
   seduced into helping the femme fatale kill her husband for the
   insurance money. After killing him in the Nirdlinger car, they stage an
   accident from the rear platform of a train. But they cannot enjoy their
   success. The crime backfires on them, and soon afterwards, with the
   insurance company's claim manager Barton Keyes becoming more suspicious
   of them, he decides to kill her, too "for what she knew about me, and
   because the world isn't big enough for two people once they've got
   something like that on each other". With her own distrust mounting,
   Phyllis decides to kill her accomplice. One night, he tries to ambush
   her, but she forestalls him and shoots at him, instead. He survives,
   though, and the end sees both of them on a steamship heading to Mexico:
   Keyes has given them an ostensible chance to escape formal justice by
   booking their passages - without them knowing about the other. With
   "nothing ahead of" them (Cain, p. 113), they finally decide to jump off
   the ship and commit suicide.
