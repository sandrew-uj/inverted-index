   A supernaturally gifted monk, "Panasonic" (Kiro Wehara), is sent on a
   mission by his dying master, "General Electric," to protect the
   Interzone, the last fertile region left on a post-apocalyptic Earth,
   against an invading gang of wasteland raiders.

   Along the way, Panasonic is helped by Swan (Bruce Abbott), a roguish
   road warrior who seeks a rumored treasure hidden within the Interzone,
   and Tera (Beatrice Ring), an attractive slave girl, who Swan falls in
   love with. The raiders meanwhile are led by Mantis (Teagan Clive), a
   female bodybuilder dominatrix and her sadistic partner Balzakan (John
   Armstead).

   After the defeat of the raiders, Swan locates the treasure which is
   revealed to be a fallout shelter turned archive of some of mankind's
   greatest achievements. Within are various items such as books,
   sculptures and paintings, along with a Panasonic-brand videocassette
   recorder that plays a final message from those who preserved the
   artifacts before the apocalypse.
