   After being lured back to her childhood home of Toronto for a
   retrospective show of her art, Elaine reminisces about her childhood.
   At the age of eight she becomes friends with Carol and Grace, and,
   through their eyes, realises that her atypical background of constant
   travel with her entomologist father and independent mother has left her
   ill-equipped for conventional expectations of femininity. Although
   initially awkward and naive of childhood politics and social structure,
   Elaine is accepted, even admired by her new friends. Her lifestyle,
   even now, is exotic to the others. Elaine, after fantasizing about
   having girl friends during her nomadic brief existence, begins to
   settle in and enjoy her new life and new school.

   After her first full year of attending traditional grade school, during
   her summer break, her parents return her to their previous life of
   travel and insect exploration. After a four-month absence, Elaine
   returns home to her friends for the next school year.

   Upon her return, Elaine finds the dynamic of her group has been altered
   with the addition of the new girl, Cordelia. Elaine is first drawn in
   by Cordelia but after a period, sensing her inability to recognize the
   cruelty, Elaine is bullied by the three girls, her supposed "best
   friends."

   After mostly destroying any self-esteem Elaine has developed in her new
   life, she gradually becomes depressed and feels helpless, unable to
   stand up to them or rescue herself. She continually complies with the
   demeaning demands of the group and considers the worst transgression
   she could ever commit would be to tattle on her "friends," a sick
   loyalty Cordelia nurtures and feeds. Elaine, despite her parents'
   concern, even accompanies Grace and her family to their church, which,
   to her amazement and curiosity, is Elaine's first exposure to
   mainstream religion. Her newly found faith is tested when she continues
   to be poorly treated, even by Grace's mother.

   The bullying escalates that winter when the girls throw Elaine's hat
   into a ravine and then abandon her to climb out of the ravine river
   water, half-frozen. On the brink of panic, Elaine sees a vision of the
   Virgin Mary, whom she learned about in Grace's church. In a haze, an
   illusion of the Virgin guides Elaine to safety. Afterward, realizing
   she allowed herself to be a victim all along, Elaine is finally able to
   make a break and makes new friends.

   Later, now in high school, and earlier events somewhat repressed,
   Elaine reestablishes a friendship with Cordelia but without Carol or
   Grace, who have both moved out of the area. Elaine is much tougher now
   than when she was as a child, and the tables turn as she often taunts
   Cordelia.

   Cordelia, it appears, is experiencing her own crisis and has trouble
   applying herself to her studies and begins to act out. Elaine feels a
   mix of triumph, contempt and pity when she realizes she has outgrown
   Cordelia. She is relieved that she can no longer be manipulated by the
   girl who essentially was the leader and the number one bully during
   their childhood.

   Her last exchanges with Cordelia in high school are bleak when Elaine
   sees Cordelia is depressed and her behavior has prevented her from
   graduating on schedule. After Cordelia is sent to a private school for
   delinquent girls, the two girls lose touch with one another after high
   school. Elaine's childhood story is told in the first person narrative
   in flashbacks with brief snippets from her present adult life.

   Elaine, working part-time in a diner and attending university, meets
   with Cordelia after a period of losing touch. Cordelia appears to have
   regained her former slyness and tells Elaine that instead of attending
   university, Cordelia has undertaken acting. She subtly brags about her
   roles in the Shakespearean Festival and invites Elaine to attend one of
   her performances.

   After a couple of years, Elaine again meets with Cordelia who has
   completely fallen off the tracks and has been committed to a mental
   facility by her parents. Overmedicated and desperate, she begs Elaine
   to help her escape from the hospital. Despite her guilt and latent
   anger, Elaine refuses to help Cordelia. A few weeks after their
   meeting, Elaine receives a return-to-sender letter she sent Cordelia in
   the hospital. It appears Cordelia found a way to escape without Elaine.
   Not knowing it, this would be Elaine's last time seeing Cordelia.

   The narrative describes Elaine through early adulthood as an art
   student and a burgeoning feminist artist, although Elaine's feminist
   label is media engineered, not self-proclaimed. She begins to find
   herself and develop her artistic identity, fumbling her way through her
   art and personal relationships. However, throughout this time, she
   continues to be haunted by her childhood and has difficulties forming
   relationships with other women. Although she increasingly becomes a
   known and influential artist, Elaine is berefted by anger, guilt,
   confusion and bewilderment of the lasting effects of Cordelia's
   behavior and her eventual disappearance from Elaine's life.

   Towards the end of the novel, owing to her retrospective exhibition and
   her return to Toronto, she eventually faces her past and gets closure.
