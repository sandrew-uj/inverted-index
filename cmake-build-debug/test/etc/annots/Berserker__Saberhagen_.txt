   The Berserker series is a series of space opera science fiction short
   stories and novels by Fred Saberhagen, in which robotic
   self-replicating machines strive to destroy all life.

   These Berserkers, named after the human berserker warriors of Norse
   legend, are doomsday weapons left over from an interstellar war between
   two races of extraterrestrials. They all have machine intelligence, and
   their sizes range from that of an asteroid, in the case of an automated
   repair and construction base, down to human size (and shape) or
   smaller. The Berserkers' bases are capable of manufacturing more and
   deadlier Berserkers as the need arises.

   The Berserker stories (published as novels and short stories) depict
   the fight between Berserkers and the sentient species of the Milky Way
   Galaxy: Homo sapiens (referred to as "Earth-descended" or "ED" humans,
   or as "Solarians") is the only sentient species aggressive enough to
   counter Berserkers.
