   The novel follows the lives of four friends in New York City from
   college through to middle-age. It focuses particularly on Jude, a
   lawyer with a mysterious past, ambiguous ethnicity, and unexplained
   health issues. Jude walks with a limp and suffers from severe nerve
   damage in his spine that causes him great pain, which he blames on a
   car injury he sustained as a child. Unbeknownst to the rest of the
   group, he also habitually self-harms. The rest of the group includes
   Malcolm, a struggling architect from a wealthy biracial family who
   still lives at home; JB, a painter of Haitian descent; and Willem, an
   aspiring actor with whom Jude is closest because both are orphans.
   After graduation, Jude and Willem share a one-bedroom apartment due to
   their relative poverty compared to their friends.

   Despite this apparent closeness with his friends, Jude finds himself
   unable to divulge either detail of his past or current state of mind to
   his roommate. Nonetheless, he thrives in his law practice and develops
   a close parent-child relationship with his former professor, Harold,
   and his wife Julia, which results in the pair adopting him when Jude
   turns thirty. While thankful, the time before the adoption is filled
   with further bouts of self-harm as Jude believes he is inherently
   unworthy of affection. Meanwhile, the rest of the group finds success
   in their respective fields, with Willem becoming a star of theater and
   then film. JB finds success as an artist but also becomes addicted to
   crystal meth. The group stages an intervention, where JB mocks Jude by
   doing a crude imitation of his limp. In spite of successful treatment
   and a great deal of apologizing, Jude finds it impossible to forgive
   JB. Willem refuses to forgive him too, causing the group to fragment,
   with only Malcolm remaining friends with all four members.

   It becomes clear that Jude was sexually traumatized at a very young
   age, making it difficult for him to engage in romantic relationships.
   His friends and loved ones begin questioning this isolation as he
   enters his forties, with Willem especially being baffled with regards
   to Jude's sexuality. As his loneliness grows more intense, he enters an
   abusive relationship with fashion executive Caleb, who is disgusted by
   Jude's limp and his increasing use of a wheelchair. Jude finally breaks
   off the relationship after Caleb rapes him, and they meet a final time
   when Caleb follows him to dinner with Harold, humiliates him, and then
   follows Jude to his apartment where he brutally beats and rapes him,
   leaving him for dead. Jude nonetheless refuses to report the incident
   to the police, believing he deserved it. Only Harold and Andy, Jude's
   doctor and ongoing confidante know the truth of the failed
   relationship.

   Although Jude's body manages to heal, the rapes cause him to flashback
   to his childhood wherein he was raised in a monastery and repeatedly
   sexually abused by the brothers. He recalls a period when one of the
   brothers, Brother Luke, ran away with him, forcing him into years of
   child prostitution. After he was rescued by the police, Jude was placed
   in state care, where the abuse continued at the hands of the counselors
   there. After the break-up with Caleb brings back this childhood trauma,
   Jude finally decides to kill himself, but he survives the attempt. In
   the aftermath, Willem comes back home and begins to live with him. Jude
   continues to refuse therapy but begins to tell Willem the least
   traumatic stories about his childhood, which Willem finds disturbing
   and horrifying. The two soon begin a relationship, but Jude continues
   to struggle with opening up and does not enjoy having sex with him.

   In an attempt to curb his cutting, Jude decides to instead burn himself
   as a form of self-harm, but accidentally inflicts third-degree burns
   that require a skin graft. The wound is so severe that Andy tells him
   he has to tell Willem what happened, or else he will do it for him.
   Before Jude can tell Willem, Andy accidentally divulges the
   information. Willem is horrified, but after a difficult fight, Jude
   finally confesses that he does not enjoy sex and tells Willem about the
   years of sexual and physical abuse he endured. Jude also reveals that
   he escaped state care at age 15 and hitchhiked, performing sexual acts
   as payment to drivers. He also explains to Willem that the damage to
   his legs was caused by a man called Dr. Traylor, who picked Jude up and
   held him captive while he cured him of venereal disease, assaulted him,
   and eventually ran him over with his car.

   The relationship continues, with Willem sleeping with women and not
   with Jude. The two settle into a comfortable life together, which is
   shaken when Jude's legs become worse, and he must reluctantly amputate.
   He manages to learn to walk again with his new prosthetics, and the
   pair enter a period of their life which Willem dubs "The Happy Years".
   However, while picking up Malcolm and his wife from the train station
   for a visit, Willem is involved in a car accident with a drunk driver
   which kills all three occupants. With his two closest friends dead,
   Jude descends once again into self-destructive habits, losing such an
   excessive amount of weight that his remaining loved ones stage another
   intervention. Though they are able to get him to gain weight and to
   attend therapy, years of depression and despair finally overtake Jude
   and he takes his own life.
