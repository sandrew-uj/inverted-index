   (November 2012)

   The game takes place in the year 2015, ten years after a deadly
   man-made virus (Spontaneous Genome Degeneration Syndrome) kills
   billions across the planet. The initial protagonists are four soldiers
   who have spent the last decade in a bunker at a Russian Kalinina
   military base. What greets the survivors initially is a barren world
   populated by sporadic groups of survivors. Every community is
   self-sustaining, with trade organized by the Seeker Guild. Seekers are
   people who scavenge pre-catastrophe (referred to as Old Time) equipment
   from ruined cities. It is also revealed that after the disaster,
   central society became non-existent, with territories being controlled
   by gangs; apparently the area where the group's base was located was
   the territory of the Slingers, a group of thugs who have started to
   capture and kidnap people lately.

   The group took control of a nearby town and its radar station. They
   also interrupted another kidnapping and busted up the Slinger base
   nearby, securing vital intelligence. The kidnapped were due to be sold
   at a slave market in New Boston, which the group wiped out and freed
   the slaves. They also paid a small visit to the Slinger headquarters
   nearby, killing their leader and permanently crippling their
   operations, as well as narrowly avoiding being caught in the crossfire
   of a gang war between the Claws and The Final Revolution.

   The protagonists acquired intel about a secretive group of highly
   trained and heavily armed soldiers and scientists, known as NOAH. Their
   operations and location were a complete secret with only the local
   Seekers knowing the location of their laboratories. To gain this
   information in exchange, the protagonists intervened in the gang war in
   Bergstadt, joining one gang and wiping out the other (the choice is up
   to the player). However, the defeated gang retreated first to the
   township Solensk, then besieged the nearby NOAH base, leaving the
   protagonists to break the siege.

   The leader of the local NOAH forces, Prof. Vlamidir Czeko gave the
   group minimal info: they were extensively but not successfully
   researching SGDS in the hope of finding a cure. They were suspicious
   about a religious community known as COTUC (Church Of The Undying
   Child). Suspiciously, nearly all of COTUC survived the SGDS-catastrophe
   and seem to be benefited from it, as they used the past ten years to
   research advanced technology.

   To get more information, especially the location of the COTUC
   headquarters protagonists infiltrated a COTUC monastery protected by
   heavily armed troops, cyborgs and crawling mines: mines capable of
   subterranean movement and attracted to vibrations caused by surface
   movement. Fortunately the visit of a high ranked COTUC member can be
   used to extract the desired information. At this point, the storyline
   splits into two paths: the player can choose to join COTUC or to defeat
   them.

   Joining COTUC the protagonists accepted a mission to infiltrate a NOAH
   compound and got vital intelligence from a COTUC spy. The intelligence
   revealed NOAH as responsible for creating SGDS and distributing it
   through the world in order to develop and sell the vaccine at a high
   price. Obviously, the vaccine wasn't completed and billions died as a
   result. Finally, the joint protagonist-COTUC taskforce raided and
   destroyed the central NOAH headquarters. At the end, the leader of
   COTUC arrived and gave the group a Hobson's choice: either surrender
   and be transformed into Death Knight cyborgs, or go down fighting.

   Opposing COTUC the protagonists had to infiltrate the COTUC
   headquarters, disguised as unarmed monks. The group had to use anything
   they can find to fight their way out. It was also discovered that the
   COTUC not only found and synthesised a cure, but also perfected SGDS to
   become an even more potent toxin. Unfortunately the leader of COTUC
   escaped to his last resort and took the antidot with him. With a little
   help from a squad of NOAH soldiers the numerous enemies were defeated
   and a counterstrike targeting the players base was prevented. In his
   final standoff the COTUC leader offered an alliance, which was promptly
   and violently rejected.

   Depending on the players choice the game has three possible endings,
   which are narrated in the closing:
     * If the player joined COTUC and surrendered, the protagonists are
       transformed into hideous Death Knights. Their only hope is to
       eventually be able to break through the brainwashing and get
       revenge.
     * If the player joined COTUC and fights, everyone is slaughtered.
       Maybe someone else will rise up and win against the COTUC in the
       future.
     * If the player sided with NOAH and killed the COTUC leader, it is
       remarked as the first step of humanity towards restoring
       civilization.
