   Crest
          Upon a Helm with a Wreath Argent and Sable on Water Barry wavy
          Sable Argent and Sable an Owl affronty wings displayed and

          Argent.

   Motto
          Noli Timere Messorem (Don't fear the reaper)^[185]

   Symbolism
          The owl is a morepork, which taken together with the ankh is a
          clear reference to the city of Ankh-Morpork. The image of a
          morpork holding an ankh appears in the fictional Ankh-Morpork
          City Arms. The motto "Noli Timere Messorem" is a corrected
          version of the dog Latin "Non Timetis Messor", the motto of
          Death's adopted son, Mort of Sto Helit^[186] and his heirs. The
          phrase is a reference to the song "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" by
          Blue Oeyster Cult.^[187]
