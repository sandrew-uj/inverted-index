   In terms of structure, the book opens at chapter six to give context to
   the other chapters. Thus, the flow is Chapter six overview of Chapter
   one, then Chapter one. Next, is Chapter six overview of Chapter two,
   then Chapter two. Chapter six then concludes, and the story proceeds
   with chapter seven.

   In terms of the setting in the future, in Part I, the novel
   specifically refers to the date October 3, 2070, as a date when the
   character Hallam entered the laboratory to work. Later in Part I, in
   chapter two, the book states that the character Peter Lamont had been
   two years old when Hallam performed the work set in 2070, and Lamont
   was 25 years old when he began working at the Pump Station.
   Accordingly, the bulk of the novel is set sometime around the year
   2100. In Part III, the novel states that the Earth's population has
   been reduced to two billion people following a "Great Crisis". It
   caused significant ecological damage, with all apes except for gibbons
   extinct outside of zoos, and technological progress being viewed with
   suspicion - for example, genetic engineering research is banned
   outright. Part III of the novel takes place on a lunar colony with
   about 20,000 people, half of which were "native Lunarites". The colony
   is stated to be the last leftover of pre-Crisis humanity, making it the
   leader in many sciences.

   The main plot-line is a project by those who inhabit a parallel
   universe (the para-Universe) with different physical laws from this
   one. By exchanging matter from their universe--para-Universe--with our
   universe, they seek to exploit the differences in physical laws. The
   exchange of matter provides an alternative source of energy to maintain
   their universe. However, the exchange will likely result in the
   collapse of the Earth's Sun into a supernova, and possibly even turning
   a large part of the Milky Way into a quasar. There is hope among those
   in the para-Universe that the energy explosion does happen in our
   universe.
