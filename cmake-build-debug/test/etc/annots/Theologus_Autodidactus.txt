   The protagonist of the story is Kamil, an autodidactic adolescent feral
   child who is spontaneously generated in a cave and living in seclusion
   on a deserted island. He eventually comes in contact with the
   outside world after the arrival of castaways who get shipwrecked and
   stranded on the island, and later take him back to the civilized
   world with them. The plot gradually develops into a coming-of-age story
   and then incorporates science fiction elements when it reaches its
   climax with a catastrophic doomsday apocalypse.
