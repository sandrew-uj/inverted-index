   At a storytelling festival, Janet tells a story of Kera Rogers, a Tufa
   youngster who is killed in the woods by a huge wild boar. Members of
   the Tufa community, including Duncan Gowen, Kera's boyfriend, and
   Duncan's friend, Adam Procure, search the woods for the beast. Duncan
   discovers that Adam is also Kera's boyfriend, and finds he not only
   wants to avenge Kera's death, but also her betrayal. When Adam goes
   missing, it is unclear whether the boar took him, or Duncan. As the
   search continues, the beast starts to take on supernatural proportions.
