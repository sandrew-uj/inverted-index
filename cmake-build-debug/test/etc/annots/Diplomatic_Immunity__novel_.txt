   Miles Vorkosigan, the main character in the series, and Ekaterin
   Vorsoisson are enjoying a delayed honeymoon off-world while their first
   two children are approaching birth in their uterine replicators back on
   Barrayar. They have just left Earth to begin the journey home when
   Miles is dispatched by Emperor Gregor Vorbarra to Graf Station in
   Quaddiespace to untangle a diplomatic incident in his capacity as the
   nearest Imperial Auditor. There, he is unexpectedly reunited with the
   Betan hermaphrodite Bel Thorne, a trusted former Dendarii Mercenaries
   subordinate and his good friend.

   Quaddies are the result of genetic manipulation centuries before, as
   described in the novel Falling Free. Intended to be used as laborers in
   zero-G before the invention of artificial gravity, they have extra arms
   instead of legs, along with many physiological alterations. At Graf
   Station the Quaddies occupy a zero-G section of the station while
   visitors use a section with artificial gravity. Quaddies tend to be
   suspicious of other humans based on a history of callous exploitation.

   A convoy of Komarran merchant ships are being prevented from leaving
   the station due to trouble caused by Barrayaran personnel from their
   military escort. Furthermore, a Barrayaran security officer is missing,
   possibly murdered or deserted.

   While investigating, Miles uncovers a plot by a high-ranking Cetagandan
   to steal a cargo of extreme importance to the Cetagandans and hide its
   tracks, if necessary, by putting the blame on Barrayar. By the time
   Miles figures out what is going on, he and Bel have been infected by a
   highly lethal bioweapon. Miles nearly dies and barely averts an
   interstellar war between Cetaganda and Barrayar.
