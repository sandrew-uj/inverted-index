   When a virus that is carried by rainfall wipes out almost all humans in
   Scandinavia, Danish siblings Simone and Rasmus take shelter in a
   bunker. Six years later, they emerge to search for their father, a
   scientist who left them in the bunker but never returned. Along the
   way, they join a group of young survivors and together they travel
   across Denmark and Sweden, searching for a safe place, and for the
   siblings' father, who may be able to provide answers and a cure.
