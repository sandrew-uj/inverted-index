   A species of parasitic aliens called "Souls" have invaded Earth,
   deeming the humans too violent to deserve the planet. When a Soul is
   implanted into a host body, the consciousness of the original owner is
   erased, leaving their memories and knowledge. Wanderer, a Soul, is
   placed into the body of Melanie Stryder. However, Melanie's
   consciousness is still alive and begins to communicate with Wanderer
   mentally. Wanderer's assigned "Seeker" suggests that she could be
   placed into Melanie to retrieve the memories before disposing of the
   defective body, but Wanderer makes several attempts to deny her
   Seeker's wishes. As Wanderer starts to uncover some of Melanie's
   memories of her younger brother Jamie Stryder and her boyfriend Jared
   Howe, Melanie gets her to follow a series of landmarks throughout the
   Arizona desert to find her Uncle Jeb, hoping that Jared and Jamie are
   with him. By doing so, she would be denying the Seeker Melanie's
   memories and the humans they would lead her to.

   When Jeb comes across Melanie's dying body, he realizes what had
   happened to her but still leads her to his hideout: a network of caves
   housing more than thirty people. Most of the other humans wanted her to
   be killed with the exception of Jared and Jamie, and later on Ian
   O'Shea, who develops feelings for Wanderer. As days pass and she starts
   to become a part of the community, many of the community members start
   to trust her with jobs and eventually gave her a teaching role among
   the colony. She is also given the name Wanda in replacement of the name
   Wanderer. After tending to a cancer patient one night, Wanda is
   attacked by Ian's brother, Kyle. After managing to save both herself
   and Kyle from drowning, the two are taken into the infirmary. Shortly
   after recovering, Wanda stumbles across a slew of mutilated bodies that
   cause her to hide by herself in terror for three days. During her time
   in isolation, Wanda learns from Jeb that the humans are trying to cut
   Souls out of their hosts in attempt to restore the consciousness and
   life of the humans but so far each attempt has resulted in a dead body.

   When Jamie is suffering from a fever caused by infection from a leg
   injury, Wanda realizes that she must recover medicine from the Souls to
   cure Jamie before it is too late. With the assistance of Jared, the two
   manage to cure Jamie's ailments in time. Thanks to her efforts, Wanda
   is entrusted with attending raids for supplies and it is now believed
   by many that Melanie is still present inside Wanda's mind. Not long
   after the raiders return to the colony, they learn that the caves have
   been attacked and Wanda's Seeker has been captured. After coming to a
   conclusion about the Seeker's life, Wanda decides to tell Doc how to
   properly remove Souls from human bodies. The Seeker is sent back into
   space. Wanda devises another plan to remove herself from Melanie's body
   and let herself die in order to allow Melanie to return to Jared once
   more. Learning of Wanda's plan, Ian becomes furious and calls a
   tribunal to stop her plans. Despite his attempts, Wanda manages to get
   herself to Doc's beforehand. Before going through the procedure though,
   Wanda declares her love for Ian.

   To her surprise, Wanda wakes up in a new host whose consciousness has
   not returned. In her new body, Wanda gains wide acceptance from the
   humans and is free to be in a relationship with Ian while Melanie goes
   back with Jared. Over the course of time following the surgery, the
   colony begins to grow and many of its residents become more prosperous
   than ever before. The novel ends with their discovery of another group
   of humans like theirs who have a Soul named Burns in their group.
