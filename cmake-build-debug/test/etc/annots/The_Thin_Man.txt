   The story is set in New York City in December 1932, in the last days of
   Prohibition. The main characters are Nick Charles, a former private
   detective, and Nora, his clever young wife. Nick, the son of a Greek
   immigrant, has given up his career since marrying Nora, a wealthy
   socialite, and he spends most of his time cheerfully getting drunk in
   hotel rooms and speakeasies. Nick and Nora have no children but they
   own a female Schnauzer named Asta. (In the film adaptation, Asta is a
   male wire-haired fox terrier.) Charles is drawn, mostly against his
   will, into investigating a murder. The case brings them in contact with
   the Wynants, a rather grotesque family, and with various policemen and
   lowlifes. As they attempt to solve the case, Nick and Nora share a
   great deal of banter and witty dialogue, along with copious amounts of
   alcohol.
