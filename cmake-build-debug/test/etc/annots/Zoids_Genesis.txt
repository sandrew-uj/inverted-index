   Generations ago on planet Zi, at the height of human development, Zoids
   were used in an epic war that eventually led to the destruction of the
   world. So devastated was the world that the planet was barely habitable
   for humanity and nature. The catastrophe was named "Gods' Fury" and was
   considered a supernatural event by locals who believed the world was
   punished because of humanity's foolishness.

   Using one of their most powerful and largest Zoids, the surviving
   people of this conflict rode on Gildragons for safety and shelter.
   While one group returned to the earth and founded Iron Rock City,
   another group built a floating city in the heavens called Sky City. The
   people there rebuilt their society and eventually began researching
   ways to restore the planet. After many years of research, they planned
   to use their advanced bio-mechanical technology to restore the world in
   order to eventually re-inhabit the land their ancestors almost
   destroyed; as they lived in their advanced city, they became hubris,
   comfortable where they are and no longer desired to return.

   Although not returning, the technology they developed was implemented
   upon the planet, which utilized to what the surviving locals refer as
   generators. It has unique capabilities to maintain energy and growth
   for machinery and life in the surrounding area. Eventually, Sky City
   would encounter energy depletion and scouted Zi with their own secret
   agents. As other agents monitored the growth and progress of the humans
   that survived "Gods' Fury," others approached people to make special
   arrangements. The council of Sky City chose a city called Digu and
   traded off advanced technology for Reggel (universal energy resource,
   like oil, from their generators). Their arrangement not only involved
   treaties, but also sending a Sky citizen to be adopted as part of the
   agreement. The King of Digu would accept Jiin as his son and Digu has
   since invested resources and developed their own technologies to form
   their own army, the Digald Army. Eventually, Digald would mass-produce
   their own special units, Bio-Zoids (a nigh-indestructible unit in
   combat, only weakness is weapons made of Zi-alloy and damage inside its
   mouth), with the aid of technology provided by Iron Rock.

   The Bio Zoids were made in rapid numbers and gradually started
   conquering neighboring villages, towns, and cities that had generators
   to help produce more energy for Digald's energy consumption. They used
   special stones that could detect a human's ability to pilot a Bio-Zoid
   and drafted them into Digald forces, never to see their friends and
   family again. Though known and feared throughout the continent, people
   couldn't do much to defend themselves as their Zoids were no match
   against the formidable armor of the Bio-Zoids and they couldn't survive
   without having a generator; people either surrendered or were
   destroyed.

   The story of Zoids Genesis actually begins around here, as Lord Ra-Kan
   (heir to the Kira Kingdom) roams the world with Princess Mii (niece to
   Ra-Kan) after his kingdom has fallen to Digald. Though his kingdom had
   fallen, Kira's survivors rebuilt a new city called Zuuri in a new
   secret location far from Digald's influence. Young Ruuji Familon was
   working with his father to help recover Zoids from the bottom of the
   ocean in their village, Miroodo. While Mii and Ra-Kan was within the
   local area, so was Major Zairin (a top commander of Digald). Zairin
   would discover that Miroodo had a small generator for Digald forces to
   claim; his troops arrived and attacked Miroodo. Ruuji could never
   activate a Zoid, but the situation was dire and he jumped into the
   just-excavated Murasame Liger (that utilizes a Zi-alloy katana). This
   Zoid answered to Ruuji's call and activated to aid him against the
   Bio-Raptors attacking his village.

   Ra-Kan and Mii joined Ruuji in their fight against Digald. Eventually,
   a battle between Zairin and Ruuji lead to the accidental damage to
   Miroodo's generator. With the generator damaged, this led to the fear
   of Miroodo's destruction (as all settlements depended on them); Ra-Kan
   agreed to aid Ruuji in finding a generator mechanic. This quest for
   finding a generator repairman would lead Ruuji to befriend Kotona
   (formally trained assassin of Iron Rock), Garaga (former anti-Digald
   rebel leader), Ron (Sky City spy agent), and Seijuurou (former Zoid
   champion and Ruuji's combat teacher; dying from cancer). In between
   Ruuji's quest, they discovered Murasame Liger had the ability to evolt
   (change combat forms) into Hayate Liger (high-speed combat form) and it
   played a pivotal role in their survival. Eventually though, Ruuji and
   his Liger would play a larger role in things to come.

   Through their adventures, Ruuji was unable to find a person capable of
   repairing the generator; his travels made him realize even if the
   generator could be fixed, Digald's expansion will eventually rule
   everything including Miroodo; Ruuji suggested to Ra-Kan to fight
   against Digald and eventually Ra-Kan agreed that Digald's expansion
   couldn't continue. With the resources and forces of Zuuri, Ra-Kan began
   organizing a counter-offense army. They invited many resistance groups
   to their cause, but only a few had interest in joining them as there
   was strong fear and reluctance to confront the Digald Army; with the
   eventual successes of the Digald Suppression Army, their reputation
   garnered the attention of many and their forces eventually grew in
   numbers.

   Ron had always been concerned about Jiin's activities and secretly
   utilized his advanced resources to help Ruuji and Ra-Kan; the team was
   eventually introduced to Sky City (where Seijuurou was cured of his
   condition) in hopes to convince the council to provide aid in their
   cause. Unfortunately, the council was not moved to assist as they felt
   the troubles below don't concern them nor thought of Jiin as a serious
   threat against their superior technologies; that would be proven
   terribly wrong. In Sky City's hubris, Jiin betrayed his own people and
   launched Bio-Raptor Guis on an aerial assault against Sky City and sank
   the citadel; many of its citizens survived and found refuge in Zuuri,
   but they had difficulty adapting to primitive life and forced to
   recognize their conceit. It was only then the Sky City elders revealed
   their original intent to the rebellion: they intended Jiin to take over
   Digald to have an Earth-based vassal force for military might as well
   as long term reggel supply. Unfortunately, Jiin's ambition was too
   great and they were betrayed by their overconfidence in controlling
   him, leading to their demise. With Sky City destroyed, there was no
   real power left to oppose him, except for the resistance forces, which
   he considered as a mere nuisance.

   Meanwhile, Jiin's power and influence grew within Digu. After the death
   of their king, Jiin declared himself emperor and eventually a god to
   Digald. His new policies were not only more draconian, but it alienated
   many of the officers under Jiin. However, it was not an issue to Jiin,
   since he is able to extract human souls into the bodies of Bio-Zoid
   droid pilots; he tripled his forces without the need for human pilots.
   Zairin was obsessed with defeating Ruuji until he discovered the
   shocking truth of their bolstered forces, it snapped him out of his
   obsession and caused him to defect. Eventually, word had spread within
   Digald forces about their pilots were extracted human souls, many of
   Digald Forces defected to the Digald Suppression Army.

   After long hard battles against Digald Forces, it was an unusual
   alliance when most of the human officers of Digald defected to the
   anti-Digald army. Ruuji felt their anti-Digald army title was no longer
   appropriate and renamed themselves the Jiin Suppression Army. A large
   final battle was waged against Jiin in his Bio-Tyranno. After a very
   difficult fight, Ruuji destroyed Jiin with Mugen Liger (evolt form
   after Hayate Liger) and ended the conflict to restore peace to the
   lands. After the battle, it was discovered that Murasame Liger had
   unique regeneration technologies that can help revive Miroodo's
   generator; Ruuji returned to his village and helped restore life back
   to his hometown.
