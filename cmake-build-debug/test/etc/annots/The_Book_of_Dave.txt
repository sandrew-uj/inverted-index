   The Book of Dave tells the story of an angry and mentally ill London
   taxi driver named Dave Rudman, who writes and has printed on metal a
   book of his rantings against women and thoughts on custody rights for
   fathers. These stem from his anger with his ex-wife, Michelle, who he
   believes is unfairly keeping him from his son. Equally influential in
   Dave's book is The Knowledge--the intimate familiarity with the city of
   London required of its cabbies.

   Dave buries the book, which is discovered centuries later and used as
   the sacred text for a dogmatic, cruel, and misogynistic religion that
   takes hold in the remnants of southern England and London following
   catastrophic flooding. The future portions of the novel are set from
   523 AD (After Dave).

   The book alternates between Dave's original experience and that of the
   future devotees of the religion inspired by his writings. Much of the
   dialogue in The Book of Dave is written in Mokni, an invented dialect
   of English derived from Cockney, taxi-drivers' and Dave's own usage,
   text-messaging, and vocabulary peculiar to the late 20th and early 21st
   centuries. For example, an unmarried woman is an "opare" (au pair);
   Dave called Muslim women's concealing garments "cloakyfings"--his
   adherents use the word for women's outerwear in general. Spellings are
   phonetic and can be opaque, making the book particularly difficult for
   those unfamiliar with the speech of England and London: "bugsbunny" for
   rabbit is easy enough, but "beefansemis" for an architectural style is
   less clear--it presumably comes from "bethan semi[-detached
   house]s." A glossary is provided.
