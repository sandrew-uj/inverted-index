   Set in 1955, the novel focuses on the hopes and aspirations of Frank
   and April Wheeler, self-assured Connecticut suburbanites who see
   themselves as very different from their neighbors in the Revolutionary
   Hill Estates. In the opening scene, April stars in an embarrassingly
   bad amateur dramatic production of The Petrified Forest. After the
   performance, Frank and April have a fight on the side of the highway,
   and Frank later begins an affair with his office colleague Maureen
   Grube.

   Seeking to break out of their suburban rut (and consequently blaming
   herself for all of Frank's "problems"), April convinces Frank they
   should move to Paris, where she will work and support him while he
   realizes his vague ambition to be something other than an office
   worker. The promise of France brings the two together in love and
   excitement again, and Frank seemingly ends his relationship with
   Maureen. While April sees the emigration as an opportunity to escape
   their bland environment, Frank's plans are more driven by vanity of his
   own intelligence, which April panders to. When the dull and prim
   neighbor Mrs. Givings begins bringing her "insane" son John around to
   the Wheelers' house for regular lunches, John's honest and erratic
   condemnation of his mother's suburban lifestyle strikes a chord with
   the Wheelers, particularly Frank.

   Their plans to leave the United States begin to crumble when April
   conceives their third child, and Frank begins to identify with his
   mundane job when the prospect of a promotion arises. After arguing over
   the possibility of aborting the pregnancy, Frank tries to manipulate
   April into seeking psychiatric help for her troubled childhood. April,
   overwhelmed by the situation, suffers something of an identity crisis
   and sleeps with her neighbor Shep Campbell, while Frank resurrects his
   relationship with Maureen. April attempts to self-abort her pregnancy,
   and in doing so is rushed to the hospital and dies from blood loss.
   Frank, scarred by the ordeal and feeling deep guilt over the outcome,
   is left a hollow shell of a man. Parenting duties are largely shifted
   to his brother and sister-in-law, with Frank visiting on weekends.
   Thus, the Wheeler children's youths begin to mirror the youth of their
   mother, who was primarily brought up by a slew of relatives while her
   parents visited infrequently.
