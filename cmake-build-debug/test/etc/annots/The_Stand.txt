   An extremely contagious and lethal strain of influenza is developed as
   a biological weapon in a secret U.S. Department of Defense laboratory
   in northern California. It is estimated to be 99.4% fatal. The Complete
   and Uncut Edition includes a prologue detailing the development of the
   virus and the security breach that causes its accidental release.
   Security guard Charles Campion manages to escape before the facility is
   locked down and takes his family out of the state.

   After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette,
   Texas. Bystanders and ambulance workers become infected by the dying
   Campion and his dead wife and child. The United States Army attempts to
   isolate Arnette, going so far as to execute civilians attempting to
   flee, but in vain; the virus, christened the "superflu" or "Captain
   Trips", spreads across the country. The government then has its agents
   (unknowingly) release the virus in the USSR, its satellite countries
   and China to guarantee their destruction as well. When martial law
   fails to contain the virus, a global pandemic of apocalyptic
   proportions kills nearly the entire world population within a month.
   The military collapses due to mass desertions and mutines, and society
   soon follows with the near-extinction of humanity. Some of the few who
   are immune also die, unable either to accept the loss of their loved
   ones or to survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.

   Stuart "Stu" Redman, one of the Arnette residents who encountered
   Campion, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a research
   center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be
   found. Stu escapes after the staff become infected, killing one man in
   self-defense. He meets sociology professor Glen Bateman and his dog
   Kojak, pregnant college student Frances "Frannie" Goldsmith, and
   overweight teenage nerd Harold Lauder. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to
   each other and eventually fall in love, then enter a marital
   relationship. This enrages Harold, who has an unhealthy obsession with
   Frannie. He then becomes sociopathic and schemes to harm the couple.

   Most of the survivors experience essentially the same two dreams. In
   one, a friendly 108-year-old black woman living in Hemingford Home,
   Nebraska, "Mother Abagail" Freemantle, invites them to her farm.^[3]
   They also dream of a terrifying "dark man" who calls himself Randall
   Flagg, among other things. People seek out one or the other. Stu and
   his group eventually meet Mother Abagail, who is convinced God has
   chosen her to do His will. The group travels to Boulder, Colorado,
   along with other survivors. These include Larry Underwood, a
   disillusioned pop singer; Nick Andros, a deaf-mute; Tom Cullen, a
   kind-hearted, mentally disabled man; Nadine Cross, a teacher in her 30s
   who is still a virgin; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer. As
   survivors continue to trickle in, the group starts organizing the
   hundreds of residents. They establish their community as the "Boulder
   Free Zone", a democratic city-state modeled after the United States'
   former ideals.

   Meanwhile, Randall Flagg, who possesses supernatural abilities, creates
   his own totalitarian society in Las Vegas with psychopaths as his
   lieutenants. His people worship (and fear) him as a messiah and submit
   to his iron-fisted dictatorship. He has drug addicts and others who
   incur his displeasure crucified. Flagg rescues Lloyd Henreid, a mass
   murderer, from his prison cell and makes him his right-hand man. A
   pyromaniac nicknamed "The Trashcan Man" blows up oil tanks in Gary,
   Indiana, and travels to Las Vegas with a homicidal madman named "The
   Kid". After Flagg sends a pack of wolves to kill The Kid because he
   intended to kill Flagg and take over, The Trashcan Man makes his way to
   Las Vegas and is sent to find stockpiles of weapons for Flagg, as Flagg
   prepares for war with the Free Zone.

   Mother Abagail, believing that she has sinned by being proud, goes into
   the wilderness on a spiritual journey without consulting anyone. In her
   absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send
   three people to spy on Flagg, but Flagg already knows who two of them
   are. One, Judge Farris, dies in a shootout with Flagg's men, and the
   other, Dayna Jurgens, is captured, but manages to kill herself to avoid
   revealing who the third spy (Tom Cullen) is.

   Harold and Nadine secretly give their allegiance to Flagg. In fact,
   Flagg wants Nadine to be his wife and the mother of his child. Harold
   plants a bomb in the house where the committee is to meet. The
   explosion kills seven or eight people, including Nick Andros and Susan
   Stern, but the other committee members are saved by the commotion
   caused by Mother Abagail's unexpected return and Frannie's too-late
   warning. Before dying, the extremely emaciated Mother Abagail reports
   God's will: Stu, Glen, Larry, and Ralph (all of the surviving committee
   members except for the pregnant Frannie) must go to Las Vegas on foot
   to destroy Flagg. She also states that only three of them will get
   there.

   Harold and Nadine also set out for Las Vegas, but Harold suffers a
   broken leg in a motorcycle accident (caused by Flagg with his powers)
   on the way, and Nadine leaves him to die. After enduring several days
   and nights of his broken leg slowly becoming infected and gangrenous,
   Harold accepts the fact that he is going to die and commits suicide by
   shooting himself in the head. After traveling alone for a while, Nadine
   finds Flagg in the desert near Las Vegas and he impregnates her; the
   horrifying experience (his face changes into that of a demon) causes
   her to lose her mind. Flagg brings her back to Las Vegas as his bride,
   but she manages to goad him into killing her and their unborn child.

   Stu breaks his leg en route to Las Vegas and persuades the others to go
   on without him. The remaining three are quickly taken prisoner. Glen
   refuses to grovel before Flagg, and when he taunts Flagg, Lloyd kills
   him under Flagg's orders. Flagg gathers his people to witness Larry and
   Ralph's executions. Moments before they are about to be torn apart via
   dismemberment, the Trashcan Man drags in a nuclear warhead (an
   atonement attempt for blowing up Flagg's entire experienced pilot
   crew), and an act of God detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas, as
   well as Larry and Ralph.

   The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby.
   They fear that the child will succumb to the superflu. Soon after her
   son is born, Stu returns, having been rescued by Tom. The baby
   contracts the superflu, but manages to recover. Once Frannie is again
   pregnant, she and Stu decide to leave Boulder and move back to
   Frannie's hometown of Ogunquit, Maine, therefore founding an eastern
   settlement, and raise their children in peace.

   The Complete and Uncut Edition includes an epilogue in which Flagg
   wakes up with memory loss on a beach. From the jungle emerge a dozen
   dark-skinned men with spears who eventually bow down and worship him.
