   The book starts off with three different perspectives of people across
   the world on a day of a solar eclipse, the first one of the new
   millennium. One of these characters happen around the President of the
   United States who is watching the eclipse from the island of Guam on a
   diplomatic mission with the Chinese. While the eclipse starts off fine,
   there are earthquakes on the island and the President is forced to
   evacuate on Air Force One.

   At the same time, Jack Kirkland is on an underwater salvage mission in
   the Pacific, trying to salvage gold bricks from a sunken Japanese ship
   when an underwater earthquake occurs causing an underwater volcanic
   eruption and the magma consequently consumes the ship taking all but
   one brick of the gold with it. Kirkland returns to his ship, a salvage
   boat - Deep Fathom, with the brick and shares the disappointment with
   his team when they are radioed by the U.S. Navy to go to a site close
   to where they are. Though reluctant, the Deep Fathom proceeds towards
   the co-ordinates given.

   On the other side, Canadian Professor Karen Grace and Professor Miyuki
   Nakano, Karen's Japanese friend from Ryukyu University, are in Okinawa
   trying to get to the jetty during a curfew. Undeterred by earthquakes,
   they escape from patrols and get to the boat which Karen had hired to
   take them to the twin dragons, submerged pyramids which had come above
   the sea level along with a whole city. When they get there they go to a
   large pyramid to explore but are interrupted with three men come from
   nowhere and ask them to leave. The women refuse and after being chased
   deep into the pyramid, they find a star-shaped crystal. Using the
   crystal, the women escape and return to Okinawa.

   Kirkland and his ship are requested to salvage at a crash site, which
   turns out to be the site where Air Force One crashed after taking off
   from Guam. Meanwhile, David Spangler, a covert operations commander and
   an old acquaintance of Kirkland is ordered by his boss in CIA and the
   vice-president to secure the black boxes of the crashed plane.
   Spangler, turns out to be the brother of Kirkland's fiancee, who was
   killed during a botched space mission, and now vengeful, blaming Jack
   for his sister's death. Spangler decides to kill Kirkland as a side
   operation.

   Kirkland uses the Deep Fathom's submersible to find the crash site and
   along with it, a huge crystal pillar sticking out the ground with the
   plane's debris all around it. He also finds that all the metal from the
   plane seems to be magnetized as they work to get the pieces above.
   Another peculiarity is that his submersible seems to lose contact to
   the ship every time he goes near the pillar and he takes more pictures
   for his team to study of the pillar. Kirkland and his team do not
   inform the Navy about the pillar but start investigating it on their
   own after they find ancient script on the pillar. Though slow work,
   they eventually find the plane's black boxes, which are taken away by
   Spangler who subsequently orders Deep Fathom off the site.

   The writing is the same as that found by Karen Grace in the pyramid
   tunnel. She responds to the emails and decides to meet with Kirkland at
   Okinawa. Before Kirkland leaves, Spangler sets up two bombs to kill
   everyone but the one with Kirkland goes out of range before Spangler
   could detonate it. Kirkland and Grace then go to the risen pyramids and
   are attacked by fighter jets, when they get away they are found by the
   people who tried to kill Karen the last time she was there. Only, this
   time they don't try to kill them. The men, one who is named Mwahu, take
   them back to Okinawa.

   When they meet with Miyuki they discover that the inscriptions are
   Rongorongo through the use of Miyuki's computer system which is an
   Artificial Intelligence system and how the same writing is found in
   many other places around the world theorizing that there was one major
   civilization which actually travelled and populated the other parts of
   the world. Soon Kirkland gets a call from his ship the Deep Fathom
   telling him they have a bomb aboard and when the phone terminates he
   believes that the bomb had exploded. Spangler, who had tapped into the
   call, is happy as Kirkland's ship and friends were now gone.

   Karen, Kirkland and Miyuki then go to the pyramid city with Mwahu to
   following the first civilizations clues but when they arrive they are
   attacked by Spangler's men. Karen is caught, but the others escape and
   Kirkland is found by the Deep Fathom's crew who are still alive because
   they defused the bomb and sent out a false message to trick Spangler.
   Kirkland decides to rescue Karen and when he arrives on Spangler's ship
   he is fought off by Spangler and his men. Kirkland's team finds out
   that soon the world is going to be destroyed when a new solar flare
   hits the pillar by the crash site of Air Force One.

   Karen is taken to an underwater research base by the pillar where she
   is kept as prisoner. When she can send them a message they decide
   another strategy of rescuing Karen. When Kirkland leaves this time in
   his submersible towards the underwater station he is attacked by
   Spangler in another submersible. After a brief fight Spangler is killed
   by the giant squid which tried to attack Kirkland earlier. Kirkland
   manages to get on board the deserted underwater base and is told by his
   team aboard his ship that they are going to destroy the pillar to
   prevent the destruction of the Earth by shooting it with a particle
   beam from a satellite that Kirkland had placed in space during his
   space mission. When the pillar is destroyed, the world goes on like it
   would have on the day of the eclipse without the devastating
   earthquakes.
