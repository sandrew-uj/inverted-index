   The story begins in Mexico, where Samson is on the trail of his Soviet
   opposite number: Erich Stinnes, a KGB major working in East Germany
   whom London Central wishes to coax over to the West.

   The task of laying the delicate and elaborate groundwork for Stinnes'
   defection propels Samson from Mexico to London, Paris, Berlin, and the
   East-West border. What happens along the way--a temporary abduction, an
   unnecessary murder, an inconvenient suicide--happens so fast that
   Samson hardly seems able to keep London Central informed of
   developments. Or is it that Samson wants to keep his colleagues in the
   dark? Certainly London Central's entire senior staff--from Samson's
   immediate supervisors, locked in their endless internecine office
   warfare, to the dotty Director-General himself--would have reason to
   suspect that Samson might be working for the other side. He was, after
   all, closer than any of the other to the former traitor-in-their-midst.

   And Samson himself is losing control--indeed, events seem to be
   controlling him. As he finds himself in a series of ever more
   incriminating positions, as one by one the avenues of escape or
   vindication close before him, the novel winds back toward Mexico.. and
   toward the astonishing climax - at the scene of the defection Samson
   has so painstakingly orchestrated--in which the allegiances of all
   involved are finally and fatefully revealed.
