   Four years after the death of her daughter Eien, Sanao Mokoya^A has
   separated from her husband Thennjay and spends her time hunting naga.
   She has lost her gift of prophecy and is now tormented by magical
   visions of her past, rather than the future. A gigantic naga attacks
   the city of Bataanar, a Machinist stronghold; Akeha and Mokoya fight it
   off. Mokoya is stunned by the naga's ability to use slackcraft, which
   is a human quality. Mokoya admits that when Eien died, she used the
   Slack to fuse Eien's soul to the nearest living creature, a raptor
   named Phoenix. Unknown actors from the Capital have used the success of
   Mokoya's experiment to fuse a human consciousness to this naga.

   Mokoya meets a mysterious person named Rider, who uses advanced
   slackcraft for teleportation; she falls in love with them and begins a
   physical relationship. Rider states that Bataanarian adviser Tan
   Khimyan, Rider's former lover, is behind the attack. Raja Choonghey,
   leader of Bataanar, calls for Protectorate aid in the face of the naga
   attack. Mokoya suspects that the Protectorate soldiers will swarm the
   city, massacring Machinists and civilians alike. Akeha prepares the
   Machinists for war as Thennjay pleads with Choonghey to change his
   mind.

   Mokoya and Thennjay ask Princess Wangbeng for aid. In Wangbeng's room,
   Mokoya finds Rider's teleportation equipment. She accuses Rider of
   summoning the naga, and they flee. The naga returns to attack the city,
   and Mokoya realizes Wangbeng is behind the attack. She learns that the
   naga is tied to the soul of Raja Ponchak, Wangbeng's mother. Wangbeng
   escapes with the naga. Mokoya is injured, but she is saved by Rider.
   She has a prophecy in which Rider is killed by the naga, her first
   vision in years. Mokoya attempts to subvert the prophecy in order to
   avert Rider's death; she leaves the camp and confronts the naga alone.
   With Wangbeng's help, Mokoya frees Ponchak's soul from the naga. She is
   severely injured, but is saved by Rider. Choonghey calls off the
   Protectorate troops. Thennjay and Rider work together to assist Mokoya
   with her recovery.
