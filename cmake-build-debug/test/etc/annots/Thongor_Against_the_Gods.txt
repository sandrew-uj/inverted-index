   The Druids of Yamath, defeated in the previous volume, plot with the
   Sarks of Shembis and Tsargol to destroy their mutual enemy Thongor of
   Valkarth and restore their dominion. They resolve to have his beloved,
   Sumia of Patanga, abducted by assassin Zandar Zan, using her to lure
   Thongor into a trap.

   The scheme goes awry; Sumia falls into the sea from Zandar's airboat,
   and is rescued by exiled Rmoahal tribesman Shangoth, while Zandar
   himself, fleeing from the pursuing Thongor, crashes into a mountain.
   Fearing both dead, Thongor exits his own airboat to search for them,
   only to have Zandar, who has survived, steal it.

   The stranded Thongor happens on Shangoth's father, the Rmoahal
   chieftain, being tortured by the shaman who exiled them, and rescues
   him. Meanwhile, Sumia and Shangoth are taken captive by Adamancus, one
   of the Nine Magicians of Zaar who are the secret power behind the
   Yamath Druids.

   Thongor overtakes Zandar Zan, who falls to his doom from the airboat.
   In the recovered boat, Thongor arrives at Adamancus's lair in time to
   save Sumia and Shangoth from being sacrified to a devil the magician
   has summoned.

   With the Rmoahals' aid he goes on to defeat the combined forces of
   Shembis and Tsargol, which then become part of his empire.
