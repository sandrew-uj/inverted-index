   By the 2080s, much of Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland.
   While some humans manage to survive in the barren "Cursed Earth", the
   majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities with populations of
   tens of millions. To combat crime, the traditional justice system has
   been replaced by a corps of Judges whose role combines those of police
   officer, judge, jury, and executioner.

   In Mega-City One, 2139, Joseph Dredd, one of the most dedicated "Street
   Judges", assists first-year Judge Barbara Hershey in ending a block
   war. Herman "Fergee" Ferguson, a hacker recently released from prison,
   is caught in the firefight and hides inside a food dispensing robot.
   Dredd arrests Herman for destruction of property, and sentences him to
   five years' imprisonment. Rico, a former Judge, escapes from prison
   with the help of Judge Griffin. He returns to Mega-City One and
   reclaims his uniform and "Lawgiver" gun. He also finds and reactivates
   a decommissioned ABC Warrior combat robot.

   Vartis Hammond, a news reporter critical of Dredd, is murdered, and
   Dredd becomes the chief suspect. Dredd is taken to a trial before a
   tribunal of Council Judges including Griffin and Chief Justice Fargo,
   his mentor. Dredd is found guilty as his DNA is found on the bullets
   used to kill Hammond (a feature of the Lawgiver is imprinting the
   user's DNA on each bullet, a fact apparently unknown by most Judges).
   To save Dredd, Fargo steps down as Chief Justice and, for his last
   request, asks the Council to spare Dredd's life. Dredd is sentenced to
   life imprisonment while Fargo embarks on the "long walk", in which a
   retiring Judge ventures into the wasteland "to bring law to the
   lawless". Griffin, who freed Rico to frame Dredd for the murder,
   becomes Chief Justice and instructs Rico to cause chaos in the city.

   Dredd is taken to the Aspen penal colony by airship, where he is seated
   next to Herman. However, the Angel Gang, a family of cannibalistic
   scavengers and bandits, shoots down the airship and brings Dredd and
   Herman back to their cave. A squad of Judges investigate the crashed
   ship and get to the cave, intent on killing any survivors, not rescuing
   them. Fargo arrives in time to save Dredd's life, but Mean Machine
   Angel mortally wounds him. A dying Fargo reveals that Dredd and Rico
   are the result of the Janus project, an experiment in genetic
   engineering intended to create the perfect Judge. Dredd deduces Rico
   framed him for the reporter's murder, using their identical DNA.
   Believing Griffin is trying to reactivate the Janus project, Fargo
   urges Dredd to stop him.

   In Mega-City One, Rico terrorises the city and assassinates Judges in
   various ways. Griffin uses the situation to convince the Council Judges
   to unlock the Janus files. He plans to create an army of Judges from
   his DNA. After the Council Judges unlock the file, Griffin has them
   killed. Dredd and Herman sneak back into the city and meet with
   Hershey, who had also discovered the Janus project by herself. They go
   to the Statue of Liberty where the Janus laboratories are hidden. They
   encounter the ABC Warrior, who wounds Herman and captures Dredd and
   Hershey. Rico uses his own DNA as template for the Janus clones, then
   commands the ABC Warrior to kill Griffin. Herman, despite his wounds,
   disables the ABC Warrior as Dredd fights Rico, while Hershey fights his
   assistant, Dr. Ilsa Hayden. Rico activates his clones prematurely, but
   they fail to stop Dredd, and the swift clone activation ends up
   destroying the Janus laboratory. Dredd pursues Rico to the top of the
   Statue of Liberty, and a final struggle sends Rico falling to his
   death.

   Having recorded the entire event, Central, the city's controlling
   supercomputer, broadcasts the information, clearing Dredd's name. The
   remaining Judges ask Dredd to become the new Chief Justice, but he
   refuses, preferring to remain a Street Judge.
