   Seven years prior to the start of the story, the Atargatis is lost at
   sea. The ship was sent to the Mariana Trench by Imagine Entertainment,
   which specializes in filming B movies about mythical creatures. Though
   the ship is recovered weeks later, there is no trace of the crew.
   Leaked footage from the ship appears to show mermaids slaughtering the
   crew. The public is highly skeptical of the video and it is largely
   believed that the footage was being created for a mockumentary. Though
   some believe the footage is proof of the existence of mermaids, the
   incident is largely forgotten by popular culture.

   Theodore Blackwell is an Imagine representative who begins recruiting
   interested parties for a second voyage to the Mariana Trench aboard the
   Melusine. His goal is to prove the existence of mermaids and to capture
   a live specimen, restoring the reputation of Imagine. He is accompanied
   by several hundred scientists and crew members, including his estranged
   wife Dr. Jillian Toth, Tori Stewart, Imagine reporter Olivia Sanderson,
   and the three Wilson sisters, all scientists.

   At the Mariana Trench, Heather Wilson attempts to become the first
   human to reach the Challenger Deep in a submersible. She is killed by
   mermaids, proving their existence. Theodore captures a mermaid and
   keeps it in a tank. Over the course of several days, scouting parties
   of mermaids kill several crew members. Olivia and Tori begin a romantic
   relationship. The ship is then swarmed by mermaids, resulting in the
   deaths of most of the crew members. As the ship's safety systems fail,
   Dr. Toth works to unravel the mysteries of mermaid physiology and save
   the remaining crew. Hallie Wilson learns to communicate with the
   captive mermaid via sign language, which saves several crew members
   from being eaten. Tori realizes that all of the mermaids are actually
   male, and that the female is a ship-sized behemoth who is slowly moving
   toward the ship. She uses undersea lights to repel the female, and
   Olivia helps repair the ship's dysfunctional safety shutters. The
   surviving crew members are rescued days later.
