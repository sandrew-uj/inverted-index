   Jane, a woman from the present day, has taken a drug called
   chuinjuatin, thought to induce out-of-body experiences. She wakes up
   not as herself, in a bloated body unknown to her. Initially she has
   amnesia. She has mentally time travelled into the future. Society is in
   this time period made up only of women, organized into a strict
   hierarchy of caste. She is a member of the mother caste. Jane's initial
   contacts have not even heard of men; they believe her to be mad.

   Doctors consent to take Jane to meet Laura, an aged historian. Jane
   learns that she has only travelled a little more than a century
   forward. Not long into her future, a Dr Perrigan unintentionally
   created a virus which killed all men. A small educated elite, mainly in
   the medical profession, salvaged the catastrophe-stricken world, and
   devised a way for women to reproduce artificially. They took
   inspiration from Chapter 6, verse 6 of the Book of Proverbs's "Go to
   the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise" and created a
   caste-based society. Laura is certain that men were oppressors of women
   and that the world is far better without them. Jane, a happily married
   woman in her own time, disagrees.

   Distressed, Jane requests that she be administered another dose of
   chuinjuatin, in order to return home. The method works. Jane, in the
   present, sets out to stop Dr Perrigan at all costs. The story ends on
   an ambiguous note and suggests that a predestination paradox may doom
   her efforts.
