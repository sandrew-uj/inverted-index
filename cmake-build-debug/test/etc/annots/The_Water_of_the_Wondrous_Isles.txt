   Stolen as a child and raised in the wood of Evilshaw as servant to a
   witch, Birdalone ultimately escapes in her captress's magical boat, in
   which she travels to a succession of strange and wonderful islands.
   Among these is the Isle of Increase Unsought, an island cursed with
   boundless production, which Morris intended as a parable of
   contemporary Britain and a vehicle for his socialistic beliefs. Equally
   radical, during much of the first quarter of the novel, Birdalone is
   naked, a highly unusual detail in Victorian fiction. She is
   occasionally assisted out of jams by Habundia, her lookalike fairy
   godmother. She encounters three maidens who are held prisoner by
   another witch. They await deliverance by their lovers, the three
   paladins of the Castle of the Quest. Birdalone is clad by the maidens
   and seeks out their heroes, and the story goes into high gear as they
   set out to rescue the women. Ultimately, one lady is reunited with her
   knight, another finds a new love when her knight is killed, and the
   last is left to mourn as her champion throws her over for Birdalone.
