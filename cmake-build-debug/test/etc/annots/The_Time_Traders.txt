   At the end of the twentieth century petty criminal Ross Murdock is
   given the choice of facing a new psychiatric medical procedure called
   rehabilitation or volunteering to join a secret government project.
   Hoping for a chance to escape, Ross volunteers to join Operation
   Retrograde and is taken by Major John Kelgarries to a base built under
   the ice near the North Pole. Teamed with archaeologist Gordon Ashe, he
   is trained to mimic a trader of the Beaker culture of Bronze-Age
   Europe.

   Sent back to southern Britain around 2000 BCE, Ross and Ashe (as Rossa
   and Assha) find that their outpost has been bombed, destroyed by the
   wrath of Lurgha, the local storm god, according to two of the natives.
   Discovering the direction whence the bomber came and other clues
   pointing to the general area occupied by the Soviet base, Ross, Ashe,
   and McNeil, the lone survivor of the bombing, go to that area.

   Somewhere near the Baltic Sea, Ross, Ashe, and McNeil begin building a
   Beaker trading post and learn from the locals that to their southeast
   lies a land populated by ghosts, a land whither no man of good sense
   would go. Ross gets separated from Ashe and McNeil in a night attack
   and must go into the taboo area alone in an effort to find them. Far
   inside the ghostland he finds the Soviet base and is captured by the
   Reds.

   In an effort to escape Ross steps onto the base's transporter plate and
   is transferred to a Soviet base even further back in time. The Reds
   recapture him and take him outside the base, abandoning him on a
   glacier to freeze to death. He climbs out of the crevice into which he
   was shoved and follows the trail leading away from the Soviet base,
   coming to a giant globe half buried in the ice. Half dead from the
   abuse he has received, he enters the globe and then falls through a
   panel and into a tub full of transparent-red gel.

   When he regains consciousness Ross discovers that all of his wounds are
   healed, he is no longer hungry or thirsty, and his Beaker-folk clothing
   is gone. A mechanism offers him a skin-tight suit made of an iridescent
   dark-blue fabric that covers all but his head and his hands. He
   explores what is clearly some kind of ship and is recaptured by the
   Reds, but not before he activates the ship's communication system and
   comes face to face with a hostile-looking humanoid with a large bald
   head.

   The Reds' interrogation of Ross is interrupted by explosions that rock
   the base. Ross is reunited with Ashe and McNeil and the three men
   escape to the time transporter, pausing only to steal some recording
   tapes. Back in the Soviet Bronze-Age base, the men leave the
   time-travel building and escape from the village just as the alien
   Baldies attack. The men then make their way to the river that will take
   them to the Baltic Sea to be picked up by their submarine (disguised as
   a whale).

   Ross is again separated from Ashe and McNeil when he falls off their
   hastily built and uncontrollable raft. He discovers that the Baldies
   are hunting him when he is captured by warriors from a barbarian tribe.
   Again he escapes and continues down the river, reaching the sea and the
   camp occupied by Ashe and/or McNeil only hours after the sub took them
   away. Two of the Baldies attempt to capture him with telepathic
   hypnosis, but they flee when Kelgarries and his men arrive. Leaving the
   alien skinsuit on the beach, so that the Baldies can't trace the
   Americans to their base, the men take Ross to the sub and home. There
   Ashe tells him that the tapes he stole indicate other alien spaceships
   abandoned on Earth, at least three of them in the Americas. Operation
   Retrograde is about to become much more interesting and Ross still
   wants to be part of the action.
