   The setting for the game is post-nuclear holocaust Earth, where a
   privileged group of humans have made it through the war in
   purpose-built shelters while rest of the humankind suffered. People
   outside, disapproving how they have been treated, have secretly
   constructed a laser cannon to even the score.
