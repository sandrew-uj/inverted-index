   The protagonists of the novel are Mummy and Raven, lovers who used to
   have a touring act at Raves and Festivals where they dressed up as a
   mummy and a raven. The novel opens as they arrive in Chicago
   searching for somewhere to live following the Rapture. They meet a
   local kid in their new neighbourhood who shows them to an empty
   apartment vacated by its raptured inhabitants. Settling into the
   squat, Mummy and Raven are happy to live in a world without Christians,
   unlike Splitters (people who were left behind who strive to become as
   Christian as possible in order to ascend to Heaven during the
   Apocalypse). As the story progresses, Mummy and Raven explore the
   neighbourhood around their apartment, and become disconcerted as the
   world becomes increasingly unhinged. Militaristic angels appear and
   begin to kill "sinners" using machine guns, the couple's dog begins to
   speak, while they and other people start to develop magical powers and
   forms.
