   "The police examine her past for any motive that might make her wish to
   disappear, or any reason why someone might want to kill her. They find
   her body after a long and frustrating search. As they sift all the
   evidence again and again, the identity of her killer slowly begins to
   emerge, like a photograph taking on recognizable features in the
   developing fluid" (Ian Ousby).

   The novel, which minutely chronicles the work of the police, is told in
   chronological order. No piece of information is ever held back. At any
   given point in time, the reader knows just as much as the police. The
   time narrated is 5 1/2 weeks, from 3 March 1950 to 11 April 1950.
