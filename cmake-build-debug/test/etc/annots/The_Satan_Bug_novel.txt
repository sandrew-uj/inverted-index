   The story revolves around the theft of two germ warfare agents,
   botulinum toxin and the indestructible "Satan Bug" (a
   laboratory-conceived derivative of poliovirus), from the Mordon
   Microbiological Research Establishment (similar to Porton Down). There
   is no vaccine for the "Satan Bug" and it is so infectious that any
   release will rapidly destroy all human life on Earth. With these phials
   of unstoppable power, a mad "environmentalist" threatens the country's
   population unless Mordon is razed to the ground.

   Like other of MacLean's works, the plot involves layers of deception.
   The first-person narrator, Pierre Cavell, is initially presented as an
   embittered figure who has been successively fired for insubordination
   from the British Army, the Metropolitan Police Service, and finally
   from Mordon. Cavell is called in by former colleagues at Special Branch
   after being "tested" with a bribe to ensure that he is still honest.
   The novel gradually reveals that for the past 16 years Cavell has in
   fact been working for "the General", apparently a senior intelligence
   director and Cavell's father-in-law, and that these thefts are the
   culmination of a series of security breaches at Mordon that Cavell and
   the General have been investigating for at least a year.

   During the theft the current head of security is killed with a
   cyanide-laced sweet, presumably given to him by an insider he trusted.
   A variety of scientists and support staff come under suspicion, and it
   emerges that several of them have been coerced by blackmail or
   kidnapping to help the principal villain, without knowing his identity.
   The villain releases botulinum toxin over an evacuated area of East
   Anglia, killing hundreds of livestock and proving that his threat to
   use the Satan Bug should be taken seriously. He takes Cavell's wife,
   Mary, hostage and sets off to London to blackmail the British
   government by threatening to release the "Satan Bug" in the City of
   London's financial district. The villain uses his hostage to capture
   Cavell and several police officers and attempts to kill them with
   botulinum toxin. Cavell escapes, though one constable is poisoned and
   dies rapidly. (For dramatic purposes this is from convulsions like
   nerve agent or strychnine poisoning, rather than the slower paralysis
   and respiratory failure usually associated with botulism.)

   Cavell uses Interpol to discover the villain's true identity and infers
   that the villain's London plan is really to cause the City of London to
   be evacuated, allowing a criminal gang time to break into and rob major
   banks and then escape by helicopter. After losing a fight on board the
   aircraft, the villain explains his motives and jumps to his death,
   leaving the remaining phials of agent unbreached.
