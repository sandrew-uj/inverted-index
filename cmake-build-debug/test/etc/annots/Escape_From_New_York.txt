   In a dystopian 1988, amidst total war against China and the Soviet
   Union, the United States government has turned Manhattan into a giant
   maximum-security prison to deal with a 400% increase in crime. A
   50-foot (15 m) wall surrounds the island, bridges have been mined,
   rivers are patrolled by helicopters, and all prisoners are sentenced to
   life terms.

   In 1997, while flying the President of the United States to a peace
   summit in Hartford, Connecticut, Air Force One is hijacked by a
   guerilla fighter of the "National Liberation Front", named in reference
   to the Viet Cong. The President is given a tracking bracelet and is
   handcuffed to his briefcase before being escorted to an escape pod. The
   aircraft crashes but the pod survives.

   Police are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand
   man of the Duke of New York, the overall crime boss, warns that the
   President has been captured and will be killed if any further rescue
   attempts are made. Meanwhile, former Special Forces soldier Snake
   Plissken is about to be sent into Manhattan after being convicted of
   robbing the Federal Reserve. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal
   to Snake: if he rescues the President in time for the summit, Hauk will
   arrange a full presidential pardon. To keep Snake from going rogue,
   Hauk has him injected with micro-explosives that will sever his carotid
   arteries in 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the
   explosives.

   Using a stealth glider to land atop the World Trade Center, Snake
   follows the tracking bracelet to a vaudeville theater, only to find it
   on the wrist of a deluded old man. Convinced the President is dead,
   Snake radios Hauk but is told that he will be shot down if he returns
   without the President.

   Snake meets "Cabbie" who drives an armored taxi that takes Snake to
   Harold "Brain" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate
   of Snake. Brain, a brilliant engineer, has established an oil well and
   a small refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars, and tells Snake
   that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the Queensboro Bridge
   by using the President as a human shield and following a landmine map
   that Brain has drawn up. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie
   to lead him to the Duke's hideout at Grand Central Terminal. Snake
   finds the President but is captured.

   While Snake is forced to fight in a deathmatch against "Slag", Brain
   and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. Snake kills Slag
   and finds Brain, Maggie, and the President at the top of the World
   Trade Center trying to escape in the glider. After a band of inmates
   pushes it off the building, destroying it, the group returns to street
   level and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge.
   Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the contents of the
   briefcase; a cassette tape which contains information about nuclear
   fusion, intended to be an international peace offering. The President
   demands the tape, but Snake claims it.

   The Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized Cadillac,
   setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Snake, but they
   hit a mine, and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain is
   killed by another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, shooting at Duke's
   car until she is run down. Snake and the President reach the
   containment wall, and guards hoist the President up. The Duke opens
   fire, killing the guards before Snake subdues him; he attempts to shoot
   Snake as he is being lifted up by the rope, but the President opens
   fire on the Duke with a dead guard's assault rifle, violently killing
   him, before the President finishes lifting Snake. Hauk's doctor saves
   Snake's life with just seconds to spare.

   As the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the
   summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything
   he wants. All Snake wants to know is how the President feels about the
   people who died saving him. The President offers only half-hearted
   regret and lip service for their sacrifice; Snake walks away disgusted.
   An impressed Hauk offers him a job as his deputy, but Snake just keeps
   walking. The President's live speech commences, and he plays the
   cassette tape. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie's favorite
   song, "Bandstand Boogie". As Snake walks away, he intentionally tears
   the magnetic tape out of the cassette reel, destroying the actual
   message that was intended to be delivered by the President.
