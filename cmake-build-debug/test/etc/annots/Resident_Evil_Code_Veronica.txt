   In December 1998, three months after escaping from Raccoon City (seen
   in Resident Evil 2) prior to its eventual destruction (seen in Resident
   Evil 3: Nemesis), Claire Redfield raids an Umbrella Corporation
   facility in Paris in search of her brother, Chris Redfield. Discovered
   by Umbrella's security forces and eventually captured, Claire is
   imprisoned on Rockfort Island, a prison complex owned by the
   corporation, situated in the Southern Ocean. Sometime after her
   imprisonment, Claire finds herself released by the man who captured
   her, and discovers that an outbreak of the T-virus has occurred. In the
   resulting chaos, she finds herself teaming up with Steve Burnside,
   another inmate seeking to escape.

   In their efforts to explore the island and find the means to leave, the
   pair finds themselves confronting the island's commander, Alfred
   Ashford. Both Claire and Steve find him to be mentally unstable as a
   result of him switching between two personalities--his own, and that of
   his twin sister Alexia. Eventually, the pair manages to find a seaplane
   and use it to escape, only for Alfred to pursue them and switch their
   plane to autopilot, directing it towards another Umbrella facility in
   Antarctica. Upon their arrival, the pair finds that the facility had
   suffered an outbreak, and fight their way through the zombies and
   monsters within to seek a means of escape, battling with Alfred and
   fatally wounding him. Before he dies, Alfred frees his sister, Alexia,
   who had been in cryogenic sleep within the facility after injecting
   herself with the T-Veronica virus, an experimental virus that the
   Ashford family had developed 15 years ago. Awakened, Alexia manages to
   recapture Claire and Steve as they attempt to escape.

   Meanwhile, Chris Redfield arrives on Rockfort Island in search of
   Claire, after receiving a message from her via Leon S. Kennedy. Upon
   learning that she had left, Chris focuses on determining where and
   begins searching the island. In the process of doing so, he comes
   across Albert Wesker, an independent agent since the Spencer mansion
   incident (the events of Resident Evil), who is seeking to retrieve a
   sample of the T-Veronica virus. After Chris learns of his sister's
   whereabouts, and Wesker discovers that Alexia is alive and carries what
   he needs, the two separately find their way to Antarctica. Once there,
   Chris frees his sister and helps her to search for Steve, only for them
   to find that he had been experimented with and injected with the
   T-Veronica virus. After mutating, Steve attempts to kill Claire, but
   fails, regaining control of himself to turn on Alexia, who then
   inflicts a mortal wound on him. Before Steve dies, he confesses his
   love for Claire. Meanwhile, Chris and Wesker confront Alexia. In the
   resulting conflict, Wesker escapes and manages to retrieve Steve's
   corpse for further experimentation, while Chris manages to defeat
   Alexia and escape with his sister, before the Antarctic facility
   self-destructs.
