   The novel opens with mystery author Harriet Vane on trial for the
   murder of her former lover, Phillip Boyes: a writer with strong views
   on atheism, anarchy, and free love. Publicly professing to disapprove
   of marriage, he had persuaded a reluctant Harriet to live with him,
   only to renounce his principles a year later and to propose. Harriet,
   outraged at being deceived, had broken off the relationship.

   Following the separation, the former couple met occasionally, and the
   evidence at trial points to Boyes suffering from repeated bouts of
   gastric illness at around the time that Harriet was buying poisons
   under assumed names, to demonstrate - so she says - a plot point of her
   novel then in progress.

   Returning from a holiday in North Wales in better health, Boyes dined
   with his cousin, the solicitor Norman Urquhart, before going to
   Harriet's flat to discuss reconciliation, where he accepted a cup of
   coffee. That night he was taken fatally ill, apparently with gastritis.
   Foul play was eventually suspected, and a post-mortem revealed that
   Boyes died from acute arsenic poisoning. Apart from Harriet's coffee
   and the evening meal with his cousin (in which every item had been
   shared by two or more people), the victim appears to have taken nothing
   else that evening.

   The trial results in a hung jury. As a unanimous verdict is required,
   the judge orders a re-trial. Lord Peter Wimsey visits Harriet in
   prison, declares his conviction of her innocence and promises to catch
   the real murderer. Wimsey also announces that he wishes to marry her, a
   suggestion that Harriet politely but firmly declines.

   Working against time before the new trial, Wimsey first explores the
   possibility that Boyes took his own life. Wimsey's friend, Detective
   Inspector Charles Parker, disproves that theory. The rich great-aunt of
   the cousins Urquhart and Boyes, Rosanna Wrayburn, is old and senile,
   and according to Urquhart (who is acting as her family solicitor) when
   she dies most of her fortune will pass to him, with very little going
   to Boyes. Wimsey suspects that to be a lie, and sends his enquiry agent
   Miss Climpson to get hold of Rosanna's original will, which she does in
   a comic scene exposing the practices of fraudulent mediums. The will in
   fact names Boyes as principal beneficiary.

   Wimsey plants a spy, Miss Joan Murchison, in Urquhart's office where
   she finds a hidden packet of arsenic. She also discovers that Urquhart
   had abused his position as Rosanna's solicitor, embezzled her
   investments, then lost the money on the stock market. Urquhart realised
   that he would face inevitable exposure should Rosanna die and Boyes
   claim his inheritance. However, Boyes was unaware of the will's
   contents and Urquhart reasoned that if Boyes were to die first, nobody
   could challenge him as sole remaining beneficiary, and his fraud would
   not be revealed.

   After perusing A.E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad (in which the poet
   likens the reading of serious poetry to King Mithridates'
   self-immunization against poisons) Wimsey suddenly understands what had
   happened: Urquhart had administered the arsenic in an omelette which
   Boyes himself had cooked. Although Boyes and Urquhart had shared the
   dish, the latter had been unaffected as he had carefully built up his
   own immunity beforehand by taking small doses of the poison over a long
   period. Wimsey tricks Urquhart into an admission before witnesses.

   At Harriet's retrial, the prosecution presents no case and she is
   freed. Exhausted by her ordeal, she again rejects Wimsey's proposal of
   marriage. Wimsey persuades Parker to propose to his sister, Lady Mary,
   whom he has long admired. The Hon. Freddy Arbuthnot, Wimsey's friend
   and stock market contact, finds a long-delayed domestic bliss with
   Rachel Levy, the daughter of the murder victim in Whose Body?
