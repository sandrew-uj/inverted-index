   Set in France (primarily Paris) during the late 1920s and early 1930s,
   Tropic of Cancer centers on Miller's life as a struggling writer. Late
   in the novel, Miller explains his artistic approach to writing the book
   itself, stating:

     Up to the present, my idea of collaborating with myself has been to
     get off the gold standard of literature. My idea briefly has been to
     present a resurrection of the emotions, to depict the conduct of a
     human being in the stratosphere of ideas, that is, in the grip of
     delirium.:243

   Combining autobiography and fiction, some chapters follow a narrative
   of some kind and refer to Miller's actual friends, colleagues, and
   workplaces; others are written as stream-of-consciousness reflections
   that are occasionally epiphanic. The novel is written in the first
   person, as are many of Miller's other novels, and does not have a
   linear organization, but rather fluctuates frequently between the past
   and present.
