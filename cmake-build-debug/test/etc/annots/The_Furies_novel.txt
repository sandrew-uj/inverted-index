   The story begins in March 1836, during the Battle of the Alamo,
   twenty-two years after the event depicted at the end of The Seekers,
   book three of the series. Amanda Kent, daughter of Gilbert Kent and
   Harriet Lebow, was among the women and children who survived the
   ensuing massacre.

   After the massacre, she was taken before Santa Anna, who led the
   Mexican forces against the Texans. He was willing to grant her
   clemency, an offer she declined, putting her life in danger. She was
   saved by Major Luis Cordoba, one of Santa Anna's officers, who did not
   fully support him. Cordoba put Amanda to work as his servant and they
   eventually fell in love. She remained a camp follower with the Mexican
   army until April 21, when she witnessed the Battle of San Jacinto,
   during which Cordoba was killed. Amanda gave birth to his son in
   January 1837, and named him Louis in his honor.

   After the Texas rebellion, Amanda left Texas and settled in San
   Francisco, which at the time was called Yerba Buena. There she founded
   a small but profitable tavern. She fell in love with Barton McGill, a
   sea captain, who made regular trips from California to New York City,
   and through him she discovered that a publishing firm called Kent and
   Son still operated. The firm was once owned by her father, but had been
   lost in a game of cards by her stepfather to Hamilton Stovall. McGill
   told her that Stovall still owned it and from that moment on, Amanda
   became obsessed with buying it back from him. The California Gold Rush,
   in part, provided her the means. She found out through McGill that her
   cousin Jared Kent, believed to be dead, was in fact still alive.

   When the Gold Rush began, Amanda expanded her tavern into a hotel and
   because so many came seeking gold, the establishment made her a great
   deal of money. Jared Kent, Amanda's cousin, was one of many men who
   came to California in search of gold. He and two partners found a
   profitable gold claim involving a mine called the Ophir. Amanda had not
   seen her cousin in thirty-four years, but they were unexpectedly
   reunited for a brief time during Christmas 1849.

   During the short-lived reunion, Jared gave a brief account of his life
   since 1814, i.e., after the end of the Seekers, and revealed that he
   now had a son, Jephtha, and three grandsons (plus a granddaughter,
   Annabelle, who died in infancy). Jared would have preferred that his
   son stay with him in the west, but Jephtha moved to Lexington, Virginia
   and became a Methodist minister. He also discussed his gold-mining
   venture. Jared was enraged to learn from Amanda that he had not killed
   Walpole before fleeing Boston in 1813, which is what he had believed
   until then.

   Men who were opposed to American immigrants attempted to kill Amanda in
   retaliation for the death of one of their kind, a bigoted bartender
   called Felker, that had occurred earlier. The incident brought the two
   cousins together. The killers fired into Amanda's home and mortally
   injured Jared. In his dying moments after being shot, he revealed the
   name of Gilbert Kent's attorney, William Benbow, to Amanda.

   Amanda replaced Jared as the third partner to his gold claim and with
   that financial backing, she returned to Boston to reclaim the Kent and
   Son publishing firm. After meeting Benbow and then banker Joshua
   Rothman, she discovered that, unbeknownst to her mother, her father had
   invested in a textile company late in his life. This investment made
   her a millionaire and, with this money, she attempted to buy Kent and
   Son. Amanda used her married name, de la Gura, because of Stovall's
   rivalry with the Kent family, but when she incautiously made it known
   that she wanted to publish more liberal leaning literature, Stovall
   rescinded the offer. This did not deter her from her goal. She
   proceeded to buy stocks in Kent and Son in an attempt to become the
   majority shareholder.

   Though he lived in a southern state, Jephtha became morally opposed to
   slavery and he became a conductor on the Underground Railroad. In 1852,
   he mailed a female slave belonging to his father-in-law, Virgil
   Tunworth, in a wooden box to Amanda in New York City, where she was now
   living, and she inadvertently also became a conductor. While she was
   opposed to the Fugitive Slave Act, she had previously believed it
   should be obeyed simply because it was the law of the land, but she
   aided her cousin. When Jephtha's father-in-law came to Amanda's house
   in search of his slave, Amanda kept her hidden. Then, after he left,
   she sneaked the runaway out of her house disguised as another woman who
   was visiting Amanda.

   This event was published in the newspapers and it inadvertently
   revealed Amanda as Jephtha's cousin. When Stovall read the article, he
   blocked Amanda from ever gaining a majority of the stocks in Kent and
   Son. He then called on her and said that he intended to ruin her life
   and the life of her son, and to take legal action that would prevent
   Amanda from ever buying Kent and Son. During their conversation, an
   Irish gang attacked Amanda's home (in retaliation for Louis' raping an
   Irish maid in Amanda's employ and Amanda's subsequent sacking of the
   maid). As Stovall fled, he knocked Louis unconscious with his cane.
   Thinking that her son had been killed, Amanda shot Stovall dead.
   However, in that same raid, one of the gang members shot Amanda and
   mortally wounded her. She lived seventeen days afterwards, long enough
   to discover that Stovall's heirs were willing to sell Kent and Son to
   the Kent family, and to arrange to have the purchase made.
