   The plot sees Akemi Nakajima, a clever and bullied high school student
   who is the reincarnation of the deity Izanagi, develop a computer
   program which summons demons from the realm of demons. Initially using
   his program to gain revenge on his tormentors, the program goes out of
   control and he unleashes a horde of demons. The demons are commanded by
   Lucifer, who resurrects the demonic gods Loki and Set following their
   defeat by Nakajima and Yumiko. With help from his friend Yumiko
   Shirasagi, a transfer student that became interested in Nakajima and is
   the reincarnation of the goddess Izanami, Nakajima takes her into the
   demon world to help combat the demons. The pair travel into a vast
   subterranean labyrinth, where they defeat Lucifer's generals--the
   Minotaur, Loki, Medusa, Hecate, and Set--before fighting Lucifer
   himself and defeating him, closing the entrance to the demon world.
