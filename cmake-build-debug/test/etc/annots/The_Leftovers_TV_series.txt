   The Leftovers starts three years after a global event called the
   "Sudden Departure", the inexplicable, simultaneous disappearance of 140
   million people, 2% of the world's population, on October 14, 2011.
   Following that event, mainstream religions declined, and a number of
   cults emerged, most notably the Guilty Remnant, a group of
   white-clothed, chain-smoking nihilists, and a cult led by Holy Wayne, a
   man who views himself as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

   The first season revolves around the Garvey family and their
   acquaintances in a fictionalized version of the town of Mapleton, New
   York. Kevin Garvey Jr. is the chief of police. His wife, Laurie, has
   joined the Guilty Remnant. Their son, Tommy, has left home to become a
   follower of Holy Wayne, and their daughter, Jill, is acting out.
   Meanwhile, grieving widow Nora Durst and her brother, Reverend Matt
   Jamison, struggle to deal with their respective traumas while adjusting
   to life post-Departure. It also follows Meg Abbott, a woman who is
   slowly seduced by the Mapleton faction of the Guilty Remnant, led by
   Patti Levin. These characters' lives intertwine and collide as they
   find themselves in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the Guilty
   Remnant and the townspeople of Mapleton.

   In the second season, the location shifts from Mapleton to the
   fictional town of Jarden, Texas, where not a single citizen was lost in
   the Sudden Departure. The Murphy family becomes a key focal point of
   the season. The patriarch, John, is the chief firefighter of the town.
   His wife, Erika, is a doctor. Their son, Michael, is a priest and their
   daughter, Evie, is a high school student with epilepsy. The Garvey
   family, Nora, and Matt move to Jarden at a time which coincides with an
   incident that leads to the disappearance of three young girls, followed
   by mass panic and chaos that threatens the town's safety and forces the
   Garvey and Murphy families to confront their inner demons.

   The third and final season unfolds three years later, in 2018, starting
   14 days before the seventh anniversary of the Sudden Departure. The
   setting of third season moves between Jarden and Victoria, Australia,
   as most of the lead characters--particularly the Garvey and Murphy
   families--undergo emotional journeys that make them reflect upon their
   lives, their beliefs, and the events they have encountered in the
   previous two seasons. Kevin's father, the mentally ill former chief of
   police of Mapleton, is also a main focus in the final season as he
   embarks on a spiritual journey to fulfill a cryptic purpose, and
   eventually crosses paths with the other members of the Murphy and
   Garvey families.
