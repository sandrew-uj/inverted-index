   In 1979, NASA scientist Dylan Hunt is working on "Project Ganymede", a
   suspended animation system for astronauts on long-duration
   spaceflights. As chief of the project he volunteers for the first
   multi-day test. He places himself in chemically induced hibernation
   deep inside Carlsbad Caverns; while there, his lab is buried in an
   earthquake. The monitoring equipment is damaged and fails to awake him
   at the intended end of the test. He awakens instead in 2133, emerging
   into a chaotic post-apocalyptic world. An event called "the Great
   Conflict" (a third and final World War) destroyed the civilization of
   Hunt's time. Various new civilizations have emerged in a struggle for
   control of available resources. Those with the greatest military might
   and the will to use it have the greatest advantage.

   Hunt is accidentally found and rescued by an organization calling
   themselves "PAX" (the Latin word for "peace"). PAX members are the
   descendants of the NASA personnel who worked and lived at the Carlsbad
   installation in Dylan's time. They are explorers and scientists who
   preserve what little information and technology survived from before
   the conflict, and who seek to learn and acquire more in an effort to
   build a new civilization. Members of PAX find Hunt still sealed in the
   hibernation chamber. They revive him, and are thrilled to meet a
   survivor from before the conflict.

   An elaborate "subshuttle" subterranean rapid transit system was
   constructed during the 1970s, due to the vulnerability of air
   transportation to attack. The subshuttles utilized a magnetic
   levitation rail system, and operated inside vactrain tunnels and ran at
   hundreds of miles per hour. The tunnel network was comprehensive enough
   to cover the entire globe. The PAX organization inherited the
   still-working system and used it to dispatch their teams of
   troubleshooters.

   A totalitarian regime known as the Tyranians rule the area once known
   as Arizona and New Mexico. The Tyranians are mutants who possess
   greater physical prowess than non-mutated humans; they can be
   identified by their dual navels. Their leader discovers that Hunt has
   knowledge of nuclear power systems, and they offer him great rewards if
   he can repair their failing nuclear power generator. However, once he
   is in their power they attempt to force him to reactivate a nuclear
   missile system in their possession, with which they intend to destroy
   their enemies and dominate the region. Hunt is appalled by this
   small-scale replay of the events which must have led to the conflict.
   He leads a revolt of the enslaved citizenry, sabotages the nuclear
   device, and destroys the reactor.

   To Hunt's dismay, the PAX leaders assert their pacifist nature and
   intentions. They are attempting to rebuild an idealistic society using
   all which was deemed "good" from Earth's past, and they regard Hunt's
   interference with a rival civilization and his destructive tactics as
   antithetical to this end. They also see great good in him and value his
   knowledge of the past. They ask Hunt to join PAX permanently, but only
   if he can agree to never take human lives again. Hunt half-heartedly
   agrees. Security chief Yuloff states that the rationale of taking lives
   to justify the saving of lives was what allowed "the Great Conflict" to
   happen in the first place.
