   Narrated in the first person by Ed Gentry, a graphic artist and one of
   the four main characters, the novel opens with him and three friends,
   all middle-aged men who live in a large city in Georgia, planning a
   weekend canoe trip down the fictional Cahulawassee River in the
   northwest Georgia wilderness. It's a last chance to travel on this wild
   river, which is scheduled to be dammed to create a reservoir and
   generate hydropower. Besides Ed, the protagonists are insurance
   salesman Bobby Trippe, soft drink executive Drew Ballinger, and
   landlord Lewis Medlock, a physically fit outdoorsman who has promoted
   the canoe trip.

   The men drive into the mountains with two canoes. At a gas station in a
   mountain hamlet, Drew sees a local albino boy playing a banjo. He gets
   out his own guitar and plays a duet with Lonnie, who appears to be
   intellectually disabled, maybe inbred, but with great musical skills.
   The men arrange with local mechanics, the Griner brothers, to drive the
   foursome's cars to the fictitious town of Aintry, where the canoe
   voyage is scheduled to end two days later. The visitors put their
   canoes in the river and begin their journey. After they shoot some
   initial rapids and evening approaches, Ed reflects on the isolation
   into which the group has now voyaged.

   The following morning, Ed awakes early and goes hunting with his bow
   and arrow. Sighting a deer, he shoots but misses because he loses his
   nerve at the last moment. Lewis is unimpressed, and Ed gets annoyed at
   his survivalist mentality. After breaking camp, Ed and Bobby set out in
   one canoe slightly ahead of Lewis and Drew. Since the night in camp,
   Bobby has changed his mind about the trip. He is frustrated by Lewis'
   leadership, so Ed takes him as a canoe partner to keep the two apart.

   Sometime that afternoon, Bobby and Ed pull the canoe over to take a
   break and let Lewis and Drew catch up after a small separation. As they
   are waiting, two men, one of them carrying a shotgun, step out of the
   woods. After a tense conversation these men attack Ed and Bobby. The
   men force them a bit further into the woods, Ed is tied to a tree by
   his neck and cut with his own knife; then the two men order Bobby to
   strip from the waist down. The two men force Bobby to bend over a log,
   and the older man rapes him. The men then untie Ed, and the younger
   makes Ed kneel, about to force Ed to perform fellatio on him. Lewis,
   hidden in the woods, fatally shoots Bobby's assailant with an arrow as
   the shotgun is handed off from the younger man to the older. Ed
   snatches the gun from the shot man after he falls, while the other
   flees into the woods.

   The city men argue about what to do. Lewis wants to bury the body,
   arguing that if they inform the police, they might be convicted by a
   jury consisting of the dead man's relatives. Drew wants to turn the
   body over to police in Aintry. Bobby is ashamed and furious about his
   assault, and agrees with Lewis on trying to hide the body. Ed also
   sides with Lewis. The men bury the body and return to their canoes,
   with Ed and Drew teamed up again. That evening they enter a high gorge
   with powerful rapids. Drew falls out of one canoe and is pulled
   downriver, both canoes are capsized, and Lewis breaks his leg on the
   rocks. His wooden canoe breaks up in the rapids.

   Lewis says that Drew was shot by the escaped mountain man. Ed is less
   certain, but realizes that if the mountain man is at the top of the
   gorge, he can shoot each of them. He decides to climb up the gorge to
   kill the mountain man with his bow and arrow.

   Ed briefs Bobby about taking Lewis downriver in the remaining canoe at
   first light in order to avoid being shot. Ed climbs to the top of the
   gorge, and hides to await the rifleman. Early the following morning, a
   man appears and Ed shoots him when he appears to see the traveler. The
   rifleman fires, missing Ed, but knocking him from the tree. Ed is gored
   by one of his own arrows on landing. He tracks the rifleman and finds
   him dead nearby. He returns the body to the top of the cliff. As he
   does, he sees the canoe with Lewis and Bobby moving out into the river
   in the full light. Ed tries to identify the body, to see if the man was
   connected to the previous attack on Bobby.

   Ed tries to lower the body to the riverbank, but it lands on rocks,
   destroying the face. Bobby cannot identify him. The men never know if
   Ed has killed an attacker or an unrelated hunter at the top of the
   gorge. The pair weight and sink the corpse, along with other evidence.
   Ed, Bobby, and the severely injured Lewis then continue the journey in
   the remaining canoe.

   Below the gorge, they find Drew's body. Lewis confirms that he was shot
   by a rifle bullet. Ed and Bobby sink Drew's body in the river to hide
   the evidence of any crime.

   Some time later, the men reach Aintry, where they explain that they
   suffered a canoeing accident at a falls upriver and that their friend
   Drew must have drowned. Ed and Bobby believe they have their story
   straight--Lewis feigns having few memories of the "accident" and
   thereby escapes questioning--but they soon learn that fragments of
   their demolished wooden canoe were recovered in Aintry a full day ahead
   of when they claim their accident occurred.

   They modify their story to reconcile this. They claim to have piled all
   four men into the remaining aluminum canoe, which suffered an accident
   wherein Drew was lost and assumed drowned. The deputy sheriff grows
   highly suspicious of them and tells the sheriff that his brother-in-law
   has been missing since the weekend. He thinks the strangers have
   something to do with it. After the sheriff and his men drag the river
   searching for Drew's body, the sheriff lets the threesome depart,
   warning them not to return to Aintry.

   Ed returns to city life, feeling changed by the violent events and
   memories of the river. Dammed, it exists only in his mind. He
   occasionally sees Bobby but the latter moves to Hawaii. Ed and his wife
   later buy a cabin on another "dammed lake," and Lewis buys a
   neighboring cottage. Lewis is marked by a limp but the two city men
   return outwardly to their lives.
