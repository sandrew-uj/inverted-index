   Julia Lofting has just purchased a large house in London as a means of
   escaping her overbearing husband, Magnus, and to start her life over
   following the death of her nine-year-old daughter, Kate. But she begins
   to suspect that she is not alone, and after a seance is held at her
   home she comes to fear that a malevolent supernatural presence is
   stalking her.
