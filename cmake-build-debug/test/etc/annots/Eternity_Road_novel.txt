   In a post-apocalypse North America where almost everyone was killed by
   a plague over 1,700 years prior, little is known about the ancient
   "Roadmaker" civilization that is said to have built the devastated
   ruins of enormous cities, and the magnificent roads that still cover
   the landscape. In the valley of the Mississippi River, a number of
   towns have united again, trade and science have begun anew.

   When a copy of Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's
   Court is discovered in the estate of the sole survivor of an earlier
   expedition to the north, a young woman named Chaka Milana, whose
   brother died in the previous expedition almost a decade ago, decides to
   gather a band of explorers and try to find Haven, a legendary
   stronghold where the knowledge of mankind is said to have been
   collected and kept safe for future generations. A long voyage ensues,
   taking the group, among other places, to the ruins of the ancient city
   of Chicago.

   After losing several members of their team and traveling by an
   extraordinary means of transport that still functions after hundreds of
   years, the team eventually finds Haven and salvages some of the
   knowledge stored there before the facility is struck by a disaster that
   they themselves cause.
