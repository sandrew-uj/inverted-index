   This story is set in the country of Opium, a narrow strip of land
   between Mexico (now called Aztlan), and the United States, which is
   ruled by the original Matteo Alacran, or El Patron, an incredibly
   powerful drug lord, who is over 140 years old. Opium consists of
   several drug-producing Farms, the Alacran estate (which produces opium
   poppies) being the largest and where some of the Alacran family stays.

   The protagonist, Matt, is a clone of El Patron. For the first six years
   of his life, he lives in a small house on the edge of the poppy fields
   with Celia, a cook working in El Patron's mansion. When he is
   discovered by three children, Emilia, Steven, and Maria, he smashes a
   window and jumps out of the house. Unaware of the danger of jumping
   barefoot onto smashed glass, he has to be carried to El Patron's
   mansion to be treated for his injuries. Matt is treated kindly until
   Mr. Alacran, El Patron's great-grandson, recognizes him as a clone,
   which results in a few months of him being is locked in a room and
   treated like an animal. When he finds out, El Patron is furious and
   gives Matt clothes and his own room and commands everyone to treat him
   with respect. Matt is also given a bodyguard, Tam Lin, a reformed
   terrorist who becomes a father figure to Matt.

   During the seven years that Matt lives in the house, he befriends
   Maria, which gradually blossoms into romance. Matt is kept in the dark
   about his identity, however, until a cruel joke reveals to him that he
   is a clone. Matt also discovers that all clones are supposed to be
   injected when "harvested" (born) with a compound that cripples their
   brains and turns them into little more than thrashing, drooling animals
   meant to donate organs. In denial, he convinces himself that El Patron
   would not hire tutors for him and keep him entertained if he wanted to
   kill him and that instead, he must be wanted to run the country when El
   Patron dies.

   At Steven and Emilia's wedding, El Patron has a nearly-fatal heart
   attack. Matt and Maria attempt to flee in the ensuing chaos but are
   betrayed by the newlyweds. Maria is taken back to the convent in which
   she studies, and Matt is taken to the hospital, where El Patron finally
   confirms that Matt was created only as an organ donor to keep him
   alive. At that moment, Celia reveals that she has been giving Matt
   doses of arsenic, which were not large enough to kill Matt but would be
   deadly to one as frail as El Patron. The resulting rage of El Patron
   causes him to have a fatal heart attack. Mr. Alacran calls doctors to
   take him to emergency surgery, and after El Patron dies, he orders Tam
   Lin to dispose of Matt. Tam Lin pretends to comply but gives Matt
   supplies and sets him on a path to Aztlan.

   Arriving in Aztlan, Matt comes across a group of orphans, the "Lost
   Boys," who live in an orphanage operated by the "Keepers," a group of
   fervent Marxists who preach the "Five Principles of Good Citizenship"
   and the "Four Attitudes Leading to Right-Mindfulness". The Keepers
   operate plankton farms, force the orphans to do manual labor and to
   subsist on plankton, while they themselves enjoy luxurious quarters and
   food. At first, Matt is an outcast because the other boys think he is a
   spoiled aristocrat. However, he becomes a hero when he defies the
   Keepers and leads the boys in a rebellion.

   He then is shut up in a closet for the night after the incident, until
   the next morning. Here, he is dumped in the "Boneyard", a dried lake
   full of whale bones, delicately balanced. After he manages to get free,
   he and Chacho are rescued by Ton-Ton and Fidelito, who drive the shrimp
   harvester to San Luis to find Maria and her mother, the
   politically-powerful Esperanza Mendoza.

   Esperanza thanks the boys for giving her the ability to take down the
   Keepers. Matt learns that Opium is in a country-wide lockdown but
   manages to re-enter the country, only to learn that the entire Alacran
   family is dead, and the estate is empty except for servants, including
   Celia. Those at El Patron's wake, including Tam Lin, who promised El
   Patron, drank poisoned wine, which El Patron saved to be served at his
   funeral since he never intended to die and wanted to run the business
   forever or to have it and everyone else die with him.

   Matt takes on the role of El Patron to become the new ruler of Opium
   and to dismantle the regime.
