   The story begins with an exchange of letters and news clippings between
   Alan, a scientist working on parasite eradication in Colombia, and his
   wife Anne at home in the U.S., concerning an epidemic of organized
   murder of women by men. Some scientists suspect a biological cause for
   this sexually selective insanity (selected observations of lab animals
   indicate that the normal male sexual urges are spiraling out of
   control, resulting in death), but the murderers feel it is a natural
   instinct and have constructed elaborate misogynistic rationalizations
   for it. For example, a new religious movement is spreading along with
   the murders: the Sons of Adam, who believe that women are evil, that
   the garden was a paradise before women were introduced, and that God is
   telling them to get rid of all of the women. When the religion
   initially arises, prior to the organized murders, little is done to
   stop the ideology's spread, nor are their actions of evicting women
   from the areas the men control prevented. Alan realizes that the
   disease causes male sexual impulses to instead become violent impulses.
   Alan, a sensitive, kindly man, realizes that he himself is succumbing
   and tries to resist the impulses, as well as isolate himself from
   women. While this occurs, his wife and teenaged daughter have a number
   of mother-daughter conflicts: the daughter, faithful to her father,
   refuses to believe her mother's warnings about him. She sneaks off to
   visit her father, and he murders her, killing himself after the
   horrific realization of his action. Anne flees north, to Canada, since
   the disease began in the tropical zones and spread outward. After most
   of the world's women are dead, adult men start murdering boys. In the
   end, Anne, pursued by an entire society bent on femicide, discovers the
   source and motivation behind the plague: an alien species is
   intentionally causing the human race to destroy itself so that the
   aliens can have Earth for themselves.
