   The novel begins where The Waste Lands ended. After Jake, Eddie,
   Susannah and Roland fruitlessly riddle Blaine the Mono for several
   hours, Eddie defeats the mad computer by telling childish jokes. Blaine
   is unable to handle Eddie's "illogical" riddles and short-circuits.

   The four gunslingers and Oy the billy-bumbler disembark at the Topeka
   railway station, which to their surprise is located in the Topeka,
   Kansas, of the 1980s. The city is deserted, as this version of the
   world has been depopulated by the influenza of King's novel The Stand.
   Links between these books also include the following reference to The
   Walkin' Dude from The Stand on page 95, "Someone had spray-painted over
   both signs marking the ramp's ascending curve. On the one reading St.
   Louis 215, someone had slashed watch out for the walking dude", among
   others. The world also has some other minor differences with the one
   (or more) known to Eddie, Jake and Susannah; for instance, the Kansas
   City baseball team is the Monarchs (as opposed to the Royals), and
   Nozz-A-La is a popular soft drink.

   The ka-tet leaves the city via the Kansas Turnpike, and as they camp
   one night next to an eerie dimensional hole which Roland calls a
   "thinny", the gunslinger tells his apprentices of his past, and his
   first encounter with a thinny.

   At the beginning of the story-within-the-story, Roland (age fourteen)
   earns his guns--an episode retold in the inaugural issue of The
   Gunslinger Born--and becomes the youngest gunslinger in memory. He did
   it because he discovered his father's trusted counsellor, the sorcerer
   Marten Broadcloak, having an affair with his mother, Gabrielle
   Deschain. In anger, Roland challenges his mentor, Cort, to a duel to
   earn his guns. Roland bests his teacher, and his father sends him east,
   away from Gilead, for his own protection. Roland leaves with two
   companions, Cuthbert Allgood and Alain Johns.

   Soon after their arrival in the distant Barony of Mejis, Roland falls
   in love with Susan Delgado, the promised "gilly" (concubine) of Mayor
   Hart Thorin. His love for Susan clouds his reasoning for a time and
   nearly results in a permanent split between him and his previously
   inseparable friend Cuthbert. He and his ka-tet also discover a plot
   between the Barony's elite and "The Good Man" John Farson, leader of a
   rebel faction, to fuel Farson's war machines with Mejis oil. After
   being seized by the authorities on suspicion of murdering Thorin,
   Roland's ka-tet manages to escape jail with Susan's help, destroy the
   oil and the detachment Farson sent to transport it, as well as the
   Mejis traitors. The battle ends at Eyebolt Canyon, where Farson's
   troops are maneuvered into charging to their deaths into a thinny.

   The ka-tet also captures the pink-colored Wizard's Glass, a mystical,
   malevolent orb or crystal ball from the town witch, Rhea of the Coeos.
   The globe had entranced Rhea so much that she was starving herself and
   her pets to death because she spent every free moment watching the
   visions in the orb. The glass then shows Roland a vision of his future
   and of Susan's death (burned at the stake as a harvest sacrifice for
   colluding with Roland). The visions send him into a stupor, from which
   he eventually recovers--at which point the glass torments him with
   further visions, this time of events that he was not present for but
   nonetheless shaped his fate and Susan's, such is the nature of the
   Wizard's Glass. Roland's tale comes to a close as Susan is burned to
   death in accordance with the vision he saw.

   In the morning, Roland's new ka-tet comes to a suspiciously familiar
   Emerald City. The Wizard of Oz parallels continue inside, where the
   Wizard is revealed to be Marten Broadcloak, also known as Randall
   Flagg. Since Flagg has bewitched Roland's own guns to misfire against
   him, Roland shoots at him with Jake's Ruger but narrowly misses, giving
   Flagg time to flee. In his place he leaves the Wizard's Glass
   (nicknamed "Maerlyn's Grapefruit" for its pink color), which shows the
   ka-tet the day Roland accidentally killed his own mother. Despite
   Roland's history of bringing calamity to his friends and loved ones,
   Eddie, Susannah and Jake refuse to abandon him. The group once more
   sets off for the Dark Tower, following the Path of the Beam.
