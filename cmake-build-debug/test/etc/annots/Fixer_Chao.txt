   William Paulinha is a gay, Filipino hustler living in New York City.
   One night, he meets Shem C, a failed Jewish writer, in a bar. They
   become fast friends and Shem tells William his life story. Once upon a
   time, Shem had been married to the daughter of an acclaimed Jewish
   novelist. However, Shem's wife Marianna realized he was cheating on her
   and left him. Furious with his present situation, Shem wants to take
   revenge on the New York elite that cast him out. He convinces William
   to help him carry out his revenge plot by posing as William Chao, a
   master of the ancient Chinese art of feng shui.

   Their first victim is Lindsay S, an aspiring poet. Bolstered by the
   ease with which they con her, William and Shem work their way up to
   bigger and better targets while word of mouth enhances their social
   status. William meets Cardie Kerchpoff, the Jewish daughter of a
   cardiologist. He finds her so irritating that he purposely fills her
   apartment with bad karma. William and Shem attend a dinner party hosted
   by Suzy Yamada, where many of their past and future clients mingle.
   Brian Q meets a girl named Norma and discovers after sleeping with her
   that she has given him herpes. William encounters Max Brill Carlton,
   author of Primitives, who informs him that Preciosa had no lines in the
   play. A later conversation with Shem reveals that Suzy was one of the
   women he had an affair when married and that she will be their last
   victim. Shem also informs William that Cardie's husband left her after
   it was revealed he was having an affair. For the first time, William
   feels guilty about the purposefully bad feng shui work he did for her,
   the cause of her sudden misfortune.

   Rowley P takes William aside in confidence and asks him to help him
   avenge his second wife's death. According to Rowley, Suzy stole his
   wife's position and company and is thus responsible for her death. In
   arranging Suzy's apartment, William enlists the help of his neighbor
   Preciosa X. She pretends to be a woman named Walung, re-enacting her
   part in Primitives, speaking in tongues and twirling about to distract
   from the fact that they are stealing. Several days later, Rowley P
   dies, leaving his apartment to William. Rowley's family is not happy
   with this turn of events, so William agrees to relinquish all claims to
   the apartment.

   Kendo, who has been stalking William for a while now, takes him out to
   dinner. Afterwards, the two get drinks at a bar and discuss each
   other's criminal activities. At the end of the evening, William is left
   wondering if Kendo plans on scamming him the way William scammed his
   mother, Suzy. Neil tries to get William to give him more money but
   William refuses, leaving a cash-strapped Neil with a grudge against
   him. William runs into Brian Q in a shoe store and learns that he has
   completely turned his life around, even founding a charity to raise
   money for AIDS patients. Suzy confronts William with her growing
   suspicions that Walung is responsible for stealing several valuable
   objects from her home.

   Suzy discovers the truth about William's criminal past and his life
   begins to unravel. Suzy eventually persuades Preciosa to tell her
   everything. She hires Neil to murder William but they are interrupted
   by Kendo. Neil accidentally stabs Kendo and he dies. William discovers
   that even when he thought he was performing feng shui correctly, it was
   still all wrong. Several authors race to be the first to release a book
   on the "Master" Chao but Shem C publishes his first, thus realizing at
   long last his potential as an author. William moves to Los Angeles and
   finally begins pursuing his lifelong dream of becoming a writer.
