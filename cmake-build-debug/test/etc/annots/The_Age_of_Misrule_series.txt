   The story starts in January. The audience is not told what year it is:
   sometime after December 31, 1999, but not very long. It follows a man
   and a woman, both of whom have had loved ones taken from them in
   unpleasant circumstances. They see a man being killed by a giant. When
   they investigate, they discover that the man had been contacting
   UFOlogists.

   The two protagonists decide to go on a trip to find out more. They meet
   an old hippie named Thomas, who saves them from a Fabulous Beast (a
   dragon). He informs them that they are being followed, and they hide
   out in Stonehenge, protected by the ley energy of the monument. Thomas
   then informs them that the world has changed, most forms of modern
   technology have ceased to function while magic now works according to
   its traditional lore, and that mythic creatures - Fabulous Beasts,
   elementals, and most importantly, the Fomorians and the Tuatha De
   Danann - are coming back to the world. The Fomorians have arrived
   first, however, and the Tuatha De Danann can only be summoned by a
   group called the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons. Apparently roped into
   this, they agree to help.

   By the end of the first book of the three-book series, the initial idea
   - that the evil Fomorians would be dragged back to the Otherworld by
   the good fairies - has been shattered. It seems that Celtic cosmology
   is much closer to Lovecraftian ideals (Evil vs. Indifferent) than to
   Christian ones (Evil vs. Good), despite the fact, it is hinted, that
   the spirit beings are the basis of all religions anyway. The Tuatha are
   as keen as the Fomorians to stay, and the heroes are left knowing that
   the world will never be the same again.

   The heroes then realise that they were chosen by the mysterious 'earth
   energy', and that they can use this energy to inspire others and fight
   the Fomorians themselves. They fight back and, in a final battle in
   London, apparently win. However, the Brothers and Sisters of Dragons
   are shattered, one dead, one lost in the Otherworld, and the last three
   to pass the story on.

   An interesting twist on the classic 'otherworldly conspiracy' story is
   that, rather than fairy myths being ancient misinterpretations of UFO
   abductions, the UFO stories are presented as modern misinterpretations
   of fairy myths.
