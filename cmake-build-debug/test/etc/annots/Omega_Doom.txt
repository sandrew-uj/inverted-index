   Opening quote

   And death shall have no dominion.
   Dead men naked, they shall be one ...
   with the man in the wind and the west moon.
   When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone ...
   they shall have stars at elbow and feet.
   Though they go mad, they shall be sane.
   Though they sink through the sea, they shall rise again.
   Though lovers be lost, love shall not.
   And death shall have no dominion. ...

   --From the poem And death shall have no dominion by Dylan Thomas
   (narrated by Rutger Hauer)

   At the end of a World War between humans and robots, a nuclear bomb was
   detonated and a Dark Age begun, without technology or electricity. On
   the last day of the war, as the nuclear bombs are detonating, one of
   the robots, Omega Doom, is shot in his head by a dying soldier. The
   shot causes Doom's programming for the destruction of mankind to be
   erased. After the world was cleared of humanity by the cyborgs, only
   the cyborgs and robots remain. Some time later, Omega Doom arrives at a
   destroyed city, where he encounters an unusual community of robots and
   roms (newer and more advanced robots), who are in conflict.

   At the city Omega Doom finds there are two remaining peaceful robots -
   a former nanny who now works as a bartender and the head of a former
   teacher, whom the other robots use as a ball. Omega Doom helps The Head
   find a body and tells Doom about a rumored stock of hidden weapons.
   Both the robots and the roms want these weapons in order to continue
   the destruction of the remaining humans.

   Eventually, Omega Doom gets the robots to promise to destroy the roms
   in exchange for half of the weapons; but he also proposes the same deal
   to the roms. The robots and the roms end up fighting each other,
   ensuring their mutual destruction. Afterwards, Doom leaves the last two
   peaceful robots (The Bartender and The Head) and the one remaining rom
   in charge of the city and continues his wandering.
