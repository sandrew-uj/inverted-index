   Earth, known as the Dragon World (DoRaGoN6Wa-6RuDo) and designated as
   "Planet 4032-877" by the celestial hierarchy, is the main setting for
   the entire Dragon Ball series, as well as related media such as Dr.
   Slump, Nekomajin, and Jaco the Galactic Patrolman. It is mainly
   inhabited by Earthlings (, Chikyujin), a term used inclusively to refer
   to all of the intelligent races native to the planet, including humans,
   anthropomorphic beings, and monsters. Starting from the Dragon Ball Z
   series, various extraterrestrial species such as the Saiyans (SaI6Ya,
   Saiya-jin) and Namekians (NaMeTUKu, Namekku-seijin) have played a more
   prominent role in franchise media.

   The narrative of Dragon Ball predominantly follows the adventures of
   Goku; upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two then
   embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls. Goku
   later receives martial arts training from Master Roshi, meets his
   lifelong friend Krillin, and enters the World Martial Arts Tournament
   to fight the strongest warriors on the planet. When the evil King
   Piccolo, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet,
   Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Goku later
   sacrifices his life to save the planet from his estranged brother
   Raditz, but later trains in the afterlife under the tutelage
   of King Kai, to save it from the other incoming Saiyans Nappa and
   Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats the powerful tyrant
   Frieza. This sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy
   the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to
   attain further training.

   Dragon Ball Super establishes that the franchise is set in a
   multiverse composed of twelve numbered universes, each ruled
   by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called
   Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction who are appointed by a higher
   being called the Grand Zeno, who watches over the multiverse along with
   the Grand Priest, the father of all the Angels. Almost all of the
   Dragon Ball series, except for parts of Dragon Ball Super, takes place
   in Universe 7. Years in the timeline are called "Ages", with most of
   the story occurring between Age 749 and Age 790. Universe 7 contains
   several planets, including a fictionalized Earth, where humans reside,
   and Planet Vegeta, the home world of the Saiyans, a powerful and
   destructive race. Many other races also inhabit Universe 7, including
   Angels, Demons, Androids, Tuffles and Namekians. Humans are among the
   weakest races in the universe. The protagonist Goku is raised as a
   human on Earth but finds out that he is actually a Saiyan from Planet
   Vegeta.
