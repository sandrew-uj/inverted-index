   In contrast to Ballard's earlier novel The Drowned World, The Burning
   World describes a world in which water is scarce. After an extensive
   drought, rivers have turned to trickles and the earth to dust,
   causing the world's populations to head toward the oceans in search of
   water. The drought is caused by industrial waste flushed into the
   ocean, which form an oxygen-permeable barrier of saturated long-chain
   polymers that prevents evaporation and destroys the precipitation
   cycle.

   The main focus of the book is on the surrealistic landscapes forming a
   changing setting symbolising the developing psychological conflicts and
   alienation of the principal character.
