   The story is told from the point of view of an observer - professor
   Wittembach, a pastor and an amateur ethnographer - who comes to a
   Samogitian manor in rural Lithuania while on a mission to translate the
   Gospel of Matthew into Samogitian. The plot revolves around a young
   man, Count Michel Szemioth, who is suspected to be half-human
   half-bear, since he was born after his mother was mauled (and, as
   believed by peasants, raped) by a bear. Through the novel, the
   protagonist, Michel/Lokis, manifests signs of animal-like behavior
   until he finally kills his bride by a bite to her throat and runs away
   into the forest on his wedding night. Some critics consider the tale to
   be an inversion of the Beauty and the Beast, whereby the Beauty
   transforms a man into a Beast, rather than vice versa.
