   Thirteen-year-old Csorwe is an Oshaaru living in a temple called the
   House of Silence, where she is pledged to be the Chosen Bride of the
   Unspoken God. On her fourteenth birthday, she is destined to be
   sacrificed to the god. On the day of the ritual, a traveling
   Tlaanthothe wizard named Belthandros Sethennai convinces her to abandon
   her vows and become his apprentice. Oranna, a necromancer from the
   House of Silence, becomes jealous that Sethennai did not rescue her
   from the temple and vows revenge.

   Csorwe trains under Sethennai, gaining skills as a spy and assassin.
   She helps him to regain his position as the Chancellor of the city of
   Tlaanthothe. Sethennai takes the nephew of the previous Chancellor, Tal
   Charossa, as another pupil. Tal and Csorwe despise one another, and
   their mutual hatred drives many of their actions. They both pledge to
   help Sethennai recover the Reliquary of Pentravasse.

   In their search for the Reliquary, Csorwe meets young mage Adept
   Shuthmili. Shuthmili has been exploring the ruined monument that holds
   the Reliquary. Oranna arrives and seizes the Reliquary; Csorwe chooses
   to save Shuthmili rather than pursue Oranna. Shuthmili is destined to
   become part of a hive mind of mages designed to protect the Qarzashi
   Empire; Csorwe convinces her to abandon this duty and escape with her.

   Csorwe retrieves the Reliquary from Oranna, who is then imprisoned by
   Sethennai. In the struggle, Shuthmili is captured and returned to the
   Empire. Csorwe frees Oranna, and they work together to rescue
   Shuthmili. Csorwe and Shuthmili begin a romantic relationship. A series
   of rescue attempts ends when Shuthmili kills an Empire Inquisitor and
   is arrested for treason. Shuthmili and Tal steal the Reliquary from
   Sethennai. Csorwe rescues Shuthmili from the Empire for a final time.
   She learns that the Reliquary holds Sethennai's heart, granting him
   immortality. She and Tal both abandon Sethennai, feeling that they have
   been used. Csorwe and Shuthmili trade the Reliquary to Sethennai in
   exchange for escape on an Empire ship.
