   Mars, a world with a culture ages older than that of Earth, is a dying
   world, and has been in decline for eons. By the twenty-second century
   it has become a colony of the younger civilization of Earth, its
   natives oppressed by the rapacious Colonial Authority.

   In Yeolarn, a city divided into Terran and Martian sectors, the Terran
   Ryker is on the lam from the CA and natives alike. He finds himself
   attracted to the native dancer Valarda, by whom he is enticed into a
   local slum. They fall afoul of a mob, who treat Valarda as a hated
   pariah; Ryker helps her elude them, and with the native boy Kiki they
   join a caravan departing for the northern desert to further shake their
   pursuers.

   Later Valarda and Kiki disappear, along with an antique amulet in
   Ryker's possession. He trails the thieves to the ruins of Khuu and the
   Martian "sphinx", an ancient monument in the form of the insect-like
   Pteraton; Valarda's enemies also follow. The amulet proves the key to
   the structure, unlocking a time portal into a prehistoric era. Ryker,
   Valarda and Kiki are hurled into this past together with their hunters
   and the captive Terran scientist Herzog.

   Beyond the portal is Zhiam, the original city whose ruins would one day
   become Khuu. It is the last refuge of the legendary lost tenth tribe of
   Mars, Valarda and Kiki's people. Branded devil-worshipping heretics by
   the nine other nations, it was almost exterminated in the Zhaggua Jihad
   in ages past. Valarda, the lost tribe's high priestess and last of its
   rulers, had ventured back into the world to retrieve the key that could
   betray their hiding place, only to be found out. Now that outsiders
   have breached the tribe's peaceful retreat, the age-old conflict breaks
   out anew.

   The situation is resolved when the lost tribe's "devil" deity, a
   benevolent energy being called Zhagguaziu, the Child-of-Stars,
   intervenes to defeat and expel the intruders. To safeguard its
   worshippers it seals off the gateway between the prehistoric refuge and
   modern Mars permanently. It gives its blessing to Ryker and Valarda's
   mutual passion and instructs them to establish a new dynasty. The
   implication is that all the modern Martians will be their descendants.
