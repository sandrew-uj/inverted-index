   Charles "Fred" Hale comes to Brighton on assignment to distribute cards
   anonymously for a newspaper competition (a variant of "Lobby Lud"; in
   this case, the name of the person to be spotted is "Kolley Kibber" - an
   allusion to Colley Cibber). The antihero of the novel, Pinkie
   Brown, is a teenage sociopath and up-and-coming gangster. Hale had
   betrayed the former leader of the gang Pinkie now controls, by writing
   an article in the Daily Messenger about a slot machine racket for which
   the gang was responsible. Ida Arnold, a plump, kind-hearted and decent
   woman, is drawn into the action by a chance meeting with the terrified
   Hale after he has been threatened by Pinkie's gang. After being chased
   through the streets and lanes of Brighton, Hale accidentally meets Ida
   again on the Palace Pier, but eventually Pinkie murders Hale. Pinkie's
   subsequent attempts to cover his tracks and remove evidence of Hale's
   Brighton visit lead to a chain of fresh crimes and to Pinkie's
   ill-fated marriage to a waitress called Rose, who unknowingly has the
   power to destroy his alibi. Ida decides to pursue Pinkie relentlessly,
   because she believes it is the right thing to do, as well as to protect
   Rose from the deeply disturbed boy she has married.

   Although ostensibly an underworld thriller, the book also deals with
   Roman Catholic doctrine concerning the nature of sin and the basis of
   morality. Pinkie and Rose are Catholics, as was Greene, and their
   beliefs are contrasted with Ida's strong but non-religious moral
   sensibility. Greene alludes significantly to the French Catholic writer
   Charles Peguy in Brighton Rock, in relation to ideas about damnation
   and mercy, and in The Lawless Roads he refers to "Peguy challenging
   God in the cause of the damned".
