   In Corazon, Dan Baker and his wife are lost and driving through the
   Northern Arizona desert when they come across a man in his seventies
   who looks like a priest. They pull over to help him, then take him to a
   hospital in Gallup, New Mexico. They learn that the man works at ITC
   and has unexplainable growth abnormalities in his blood vessels. The
   man dies less than twenty-four hours later.

   In the Dordogne (southwest) portion of France, Archeology Professor
   Edward Johnston leads a group of relatively young archaeologists-Chris
   Hughes, Kate Erickson, and Andre Marek-as they study the
   fourteenth-century towns of Castelgard and La Roque. Professor Johnston
   travels to New Mexico because he has reason to believe ITC, their funds
   provider, is guilty of foul play. During his absence, his students
   discover several disturbing sights, including the lens to Professor
   Johnston's glasses and an inexplicable message from him. Chris, Kate,
   Andre, and a computer specialist named David Stern are whisked away to
   ITC Headquarters in New Mexico by the company's vice president John
   Gordon.

   Once there, ITC CEO Robert Doniger informs them that Professor Johnston
   has traveled to 1357 using their undisclosed quantum technology. The
   students decide to venture into the past to rescue the professor. Stern
   chooses to stay behind, realizing that the time period is probably
   extremely dangerous.

   Immediately when they arrive in 1357, they are attacked by knights.
   Their ITC guards are murdered, and one activates a grenade before he is
   fatally wounded, and inadvertently initiates his return, causing the
   return pad in the present to be severely damaged. Stern and the ITC
   employees then struggle to repair it so the students can return home.

   Kate and Andre find Professor Johnston; Lord Oliver of Castelgard is
   keeping him under arrest as he is convinced Professor Johnston knows
   the secret passageway to the famous castle of La Roque, which is
   commanded by Arnaut de Cervole, Lord Oliver's arch-nemesis, who plans
   to attack Lord Oliver's domain.

   Meanwhile, Chris inadvertently tells a boy-in-disguise that he is a
   nobleman, and the boy is revealed to be a woman named Lady Claire in
   disguise. She takes Chris to Sir Guy de Malegant, her fiance. Chris and
   Andre (who has since found Chris) meet Guy, who challenges them to a
   joust: Chris's proclamation of nobility and his flirtations with
   certain women have turned him into the enemy of several men. The two
   escape thanks to Andre's intelligence and knowledge of the area.

   Oliver orders the students' deaths. They flee and are pursued by Guy
   and his knight, Robert de Kere. To keep Lord Oliver's men from pursuing
   them, the students look for the secret passage to La Roque. Chris and
   Kate focus on the secret passage while Andre gains entry into
   Castelgard by posing as Professor Johnston's assistant. Andre learns
   that the professor is helping Lord Oliver build a weapon to defeat
   Arnaut's incoming forces, believing that Oliver will lose the siege as
   he is supposed to.

   Simultaneously, Chris learns that another future-person is helping De
   Cervole's forces. The man is revealed to be de Kere, who is really
   Robert Deckard, an ITC worker who has undergone so many time travel
   trips that his structure is tampered and weakened, much like the
   seventy-year-old man the couple in Arizona found at the beginning of
   the novel. Deckard plans to take the next trip to the future for
   himself.

   Arnaut begins the siege of Castelgard, and eventually emerges
   victorious. During the battle, Kate runs away from Guy and sends him
   falling to his death. Andre and Chris free Professor Johnston from a
   dungeon. They see Arnaut battling Oliver, which ends with the latter
   being trapped in a deep pit. As the time travelers flee, Chris is
   attacked by Deckard, but kills him by setting him on fire with
   gunpowder supplied by Professor Johnston.

   Stern and the ITC employees repair the machine just in time for the
   students' return. Andre realizes that he has longed for this life, and
   convinces the others to return to the present without him.

   Back in the present, the team is confronted by Doniger, who, having had
   little concern for their safety, intends to exploit the quantum
   technology for his own monetary gain. Fed up with his boss, Gordon
   knocks him out and uses the machine to trap him in 1348 Europe, during
   the Black Plague.

   The novel concludes with an epilogue. Chris and Kate are now married
   and expecting their first child. While digging through a site one day,
   they come across the grave of Andre and Lady Claire. They are pleased
   to know the two led a happy life together, and that Andre never forgot
   them.
