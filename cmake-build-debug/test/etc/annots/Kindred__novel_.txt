   Kindred scholars have noted that the novel's chapter headings suggest
   something "elemental, apocalyptic, archetypal about the events in the
   narrative," thus giving the impression that the main characters are
   participating in matters greater than their personal
   experiences.^[2]^[3]

   Prologue
   Dana wakes up in the hospital with her arm amputated. Police deputies
   question her about the circumstances surrounding the loss of her arm
   and ask her whether her husband Kevin, a white man, beats her. Dana
   tells them that it was an accident and that Kevin is not to blame. When
   Kevin visits her, they are both afraid of telling the truth because
   they know nobody would believe them.

   The River
   Their predicament began on June 9, 1976, the day of her twenty-sixth
   birthday. The day before, she and Kevin had moved into a house a few
   miles away from their old apartment in Los Angeles. While unpacking,
   Dana suddenly becomes dizzy, and her surroundings begin to fade away.
   When she comes to her senses, she finds herself at the edge of a wood,
   near a river where a small, red-haired boy is drowning. Dana wades in
   after him, drags him to the shore, and tries to resuscitate him. The
   boy's mother, who had been unable to save him, begins screaming and
   hitting Dana, accusing her of killing her son, whom she identifies as
   Rufus. A man arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. She
   becomes dizzy again and arrives back at her new house with Kevin beside
   her. Kevin, shocked at her disappearance and reappearance, tries to
   understand if the whole episode was real or a hallucination.

   The Fire
   Dana managed to wash off the filth from the river before the dizziness
   sets in once again. This time, she is whisked back to a bedroom where a
   red-haired boy has set his bedroom drapes aflame. The boy turns out to
   be Rufus, now a few years older. Dana quickly puts out the fire and
   speaks to Rufus, who, unafraid, confesses he set fire to the drapes to
   get back at his father for beating him after he stole a dollar. During
   their ensuing conversation, Rufus's casual use of the word "nigger" to
   refer to Dana, who is black, initially upsets Dana, but then leads her
   to figure out that she has been transported back in time as well as
   space, specifically to Maryland, circa 1815. Following Rufus's advice,
   Dana seeks refuge at the home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free
   blacks who live on the edge of the plantation. Dana realizes that both
   Rufus and Alice are her ancestors, and will one day have children. At
   the Greenwoods', she witnesses a group of young white men smash down
   the door, drag out Alice's father, who is a slave, and whip him
   brutally for being there without papers. One of the men punches Alice's
   mother when she refuses his advances. The men leave, Dana comes out of
   hiding, and helps Alice's mother, only to be confronted by one of the
   white men, who hits her and attempts to rape her. Fearing for her life,
   Dana becomes dizzy and returns to 1976. Though hours have passed for
   her, Kevin assures her that she has been gone only for a few minutes.
   The next day, Kevin and Dana prepare for the possibility that she may
   travel back in time again by packing a survival bag for her and by
   doing some research on black history from the books in their home
   library.

   The Fall
   In a flashback, Dana recounts how she met Kevin while doing
   minimum-wage temporary jobs at an auto-parts warehouse. Kevin becomes
   interested in Dana when he learns she is a writer like him, and she
   befriends him even though he is white and their coworkers judge their
   relationship. They find they have much in common; both are orphans,
   both love to write, and both their families disapproved of their
   aspiration to become writers. They become lovers.

   As Kevin is leaving for the library to find out how to forge "free
   papers" for Dana, she feels the dizziness coming back. This time, Kevin
   holds on to her and also travels to the past. They find Rufus writhing
   in pain from a broken leg. Next to him is a black boy named Nigel, whom
   they send to the main house for help. Rufus reacts with violent
   disbelief when he finds out that Kevin and Dana are married: whites and
   blacks are not allowed to marry in his time. Dana and Kevin explain to
   Rufus that they are from the future and prove it by showing the dates
   stamped on the coins Kevin carries in his pockets. Rufus promises to
   keep their identities a secret, and Dana tells Kevin to pretend that he
   is her owner. When Tom Weylin arrives with his slave Luke to retrieve
   Rufus, Kevin introduces himself. Weylin grudgingly invites him to
   dinner. Once back in the Weylin plantation, Margaret, Rufus's mother,
   fusses about her son's well-being and, jealous of the attention Rufus
   shows Dana, sends Dana to the cookhouse. There, Dana meets two house
   slaves: Sarah, the cook; and Carrie, her mute daughter. Unsure as to
   what their next act should be, Kevin accepts Weylin's offer to become
   Rufus's tutor. Kevin and Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks.
   They observe the relentless cruelty and torture that Weylin, Margaret,
   and the spoiled Rufus use against the slaves. While none is actually
   sadistic or evil, they feel entitled to treat the slaves as property.
   Weylin catches Dana reading and whips her mercilessly. The dizziness
   overcomes her before Kevin can reach her and she travels back to 1976
   alone.

   The Fight
   In a flashback, Dana remembers how she and Kevin were married. Both of
   their families opposed the marriage due to ethnic bias. While Kevin's
   reactionary sister is prejudiced against African Americans, Dana's
   uncle abhors the idea of a white man eventually inheriting his
   property. Only Dana's aunt favors the union, as it would mean that her
   niece's children would have lighter skin. Kevin and Dana marry without
   any family present.

   After eight days of being home recuperating without Kevin, Dana time
   travels to find Rufus getting beaten up by Alice Greenwood's husband,
   the slave Isaac Jackson. Dana learns that Rufus had attempted to rape
   Alice, once his childhood friend. Dana convinces Isaac not to kill
   Rufus, and Alice and Isaac run away while Dana gets Rufus home. She
   learns that it has been five years since her last visit and that Kevin
   has left Maryland. Dana nurses Rufus back to health in return for his
   help delivering letters to Kevin. Five days later, Alice and Isaac are
   caught. Isaac is mutilated and sold to traders heading to Mississippi.
   Alice is beaten, savaged by dogs, and enslaved as punishment for
   helping Isaac escape. Rufus, who claims to love Alice, buys her, and
   orders Dana to nurse her back to health. Dana does so with much care.
   When Alice finally recovers, she curses Dana for not letting her die,
   and is wracked with grief for her lost husband.

   Rufus orders Dana to convince Alice to sleep with him now that she has
   recovered. Dana speaks with Alice, outlining her three choices: she can
   refuse and be whipped and raped; she can acquiesce and be raped without
   being beaten; or she can try again to run away. Injured and terrified
   from her previous punishment, Alice gives in to Rufus's desire and
   becomes his concubine. While in his bedroom, Alice finds out that Rufus
   did not send Dana's letters to Kevin, and tells Dana. Furious that
   Rufus lied to her, Dana runs away to find Kevin, but is betrayed by a
   jealous slave, Liza. Rufus and Weylin capture her and Weylin whips her
   brutally. When Weylin learns that Rufus failed to keep his promise to
   Dana to send her letters, he writes to Kevin and tells him that Dana is
   on the plantation. Kevin comes to retrieve Dana, but Rufus stops them
   on the road and threatens to shoot them. He tells Dana that she can't
   leave him again. The dizziness overcomes Dana and she travels back to
   1976, this time with Kevin.

   The Storm
   Dana's and Kevin's happy reunion is short-lived, as Kevin has a hard
   time adjusting to the present after living in the past for five years.
   He shares a few details of his life in the past with Dana: he witnessed
   terrible atrocities against slaves, traveled farther up north, worked
   as a teacher, helped slaves escape, and grew a beard to disguise
   himself from a lynch mob. Disconcerted about his trouble in re-entering
   his former world, he grows angry and cold. Deciding to let him work his
   feelings out for himself, Dana packs a bag in case she time travels
   again.

   Soon enough she finds herself outside the Weylin plantation house in a
   rainstorm, with a very drunk Rufus lying face down in a puddle. She
   tries to drag him back to the house, then gets Nigel to help her carry
   him. Back at the house, an aged Weylin appoints Dana to nurse Rufus
   back to health under threat of her life. Suspecting Rufus has malaria
   and knowing she cannot help much, Dana feeds Rufus the aspirin she has
   packed to lower his fever. Rufus survives, but remains weak for weeks.
   Dana learns that Rufus and Alice have had three mixed-race children of
   the plantation and that only one, a boy named Joe, has survived. Alice
   is pregnant again. Rufus had forced Alice to let the doctor bleed the
   other two when they had fallen ill, a customary treatment of the time,
   but it killed them. Weylin has a heart attack and, when Dana is unable
   to save his life, Rufus sends her to work in the corn fields as
   punishment. By the time he repents his decision, she has collapsed from
   exhaustion and is being whipped by the overseer. Rufus appoints Dana as
   the caretaker of his ailing mother, Margaret. Now the master of the
   plantation, Rufus sells off some slaves, including Tess, Weylin's
   former concubine. Dana expresses her anger about that sale, and Rufus
   explains that his father left debts he must pay. He convinces Dana to
   use her writing talent to stave off his other creditors. Dana abhors
   secretarial work, and had argued with Kevin about his asking her to
   type his manuscripts. Time passes and Alice gives birth to a girl,
   Hagar, a direct ancestor of Dana. Alice confides that she plans to run
   away with her children as soon as possible, as she fears that she is
   forgetting to hate Rufus. Dana convinces Rufus to let her teach his son
   Joe and some of the slave children how to read. However, when a slave
   named Sam asks Dana if his younger siblings can join in on the lessons,
   Rufus sells him away as punishment for flirting with her. When Dana
   tries to interfere, Rufus hits her. Faced with her own powerlessness
   over Rufus, she retrieves the knife she has brought from home and slits
   her wrists in an effort to time travel.

   The Rope

   Dana awakens back at home with her wrists bandaged and Kevin by her
   side. She tells him of her eight months in the plantation, of Hagar's
   birth, and of the need to keep Rufus alive, as the slaves would be
   separated and sold if he died. When Kevin asks if Rufus has raped Dana,
   she responds that he has not, that a rape attempt would be the act that
   would cause her to kill him, despite the possible consequences. Fifteen
   days later, on the 4th of July, Dana returns to the plantation where
   she finds that Alice has hanged herself. Alice attempted to run away
   after Dana disappeared, and as punishment Rufus whipped her and told
   her that he had sold her children. In reality, he had sent to them to
   stay with his aunt in Baltimore. Racked with guilt about Alice's death,
   Rufus nearly commits suicide. After Alice's funeral, Dana uses that
   guilt to convince Rufus to free his children by Alice. From that moment
   on, Rufus keeps Dana at his side almost constantly, having her share
   meals and teach his children. One day, he finally admits that he wants
   Dana to replace Alice in his life. He says that unlike Alice, who,
   despite growing used to Rufus, never stopped plotting to escape him,
   Dana will see that he is a fair master and eventually stop hating him.
   Dana, horrified at the thought of forgiving Rufus in this way, flees to
   the attic to find her knife. Rufus follows her there, and when he
   attempts to rape her, Dana stabs him twice with her knife. Nigel
   arrives to see Rufus's death throes, at which point Dana becomes
   terribly sick and time travels home for the last time, only to find
   herself in excruciating pain, as her arm has been joined to a wall in
   the spot where Rufus was holding it.

   Epilogue
   Dana and Kevin travel to Baltimore to investigate the fate of the
   Weylin plantation after the death of Rufus, but they find very little;
   a newspaper notice reporting Rufus's death as a result of his house
   catching fire, and a Slave Sale announcement listing all the Weylin
   slaves except Nigel, Carrie, Joe, and Hagar. Dana speculates that Nigel
   covered up the murder by starting the fire, and feels responsible for
   the sale of the slaves. To that, Kevin responds that she cannot do
   anything about the past, and now that Rufus is finally dead, they can
   return to their peaceful life together.
