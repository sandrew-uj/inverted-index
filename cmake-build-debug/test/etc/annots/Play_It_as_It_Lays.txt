   The novel begins with an internal monologue by the 31-year-old Maria
   Wyeth, followed by short reminiscences of her friend Helene, and
   ex-husband, film producer Carter Lang. The further narration is
   conducted from a third-person perspective in eighty-four chapters of
   terse, controlled and highly visual prose typical of Didion.

   Maria's story begins as she is recovering from a mental breakdown in a
   psychiatric hospital in the Los Angeles area, but soon flashes back to
   her life before the hospital. A not-quite lurid view of life in
   Hollywood follows. Didion's late 1960s Los Angeles is a mix of grimness
   and glamour. Maria's journey oscillates between dizzying and domestic,
   as her acting career slows and her personal life collapses.

   Maria contrasts her life in Los Angeles with her childhood in Silver
   Wells, Nevada, a small town so inconsequential that it no longer
   exists. The daughter of a gambling father and a neurotic mother who bet
   on a mine and lost, Maria moved to New York to become an actress. In
   New York, Maria works temporarily as a model and meets Ivan Costello, a
   psychopathic blackmailer who has no hesitation exploiting Maria for her
   money or her body.

   In New York, Maria receives news of her mother's death in a car wreck,
   possibly a suicide. Her father dies soon after, leaving useless mineral
   rights to his business partner and friend Benny Austin. Maria withdraws
   from acting and modeling, splits up with Ivan, and eventually meets
   Carter and moves to Hollywood. Later, we find that she and Carter have
   a 4-year-old daughter Kate, who is under mental and physical
   "treatment" for some "aberrant chemical in her brain". Maria truly
   loves Kate, as indicated by her tender descriptions, her frequent
   hospital visits, and her determination "to get her out".

   An inevitable divorce, and the ensuing social chaos bring Maria to
   indulge in self-destructive behavior. She plunges into long nights of
   compulsive driving, wandering Southern California's freeways, through
   motels and bars, drinking and chancing sexual encounters with actors
   and ex-lovers. After a series of disasters for Maria, infidelity among
   her friends adds further chaos to her life. Her friend BZ commits
   suicide and Maria is institutionalized. From her hospital, Maria turns
   her visitors away, and plans for a day she might see her daughter
   again.
