   The Mists of Avalon is a generations-spanning retelling of the
   Arthurian legend that brings it back to its Brythonic Celtic roots (see
   Matter of Britain). The plot tells the story of the women who influence
   King Arthur, High King of Britain, and those around him.

   The book's protagonist is Morgaine, priestess of Avalon, who is King
   Arthur's half-sister. Their mother Igraine is married to Uther
   Pendragon after Morgaine's biological father, Gorlois, is killed in
   battle. Rumors spread in Avalon that before Igraine knew her husband
   Gorlois was killed, Uther consulted with the Merlin, who used his magic
   to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access
   to Igraine at Tintagel. He spent the night with her and they conceived
   a son, Arthur. Morgaine witnesses Uther Pendragon's accession to the
   throne of Caerleon after his predecessor, Ambrosius, dies of old age.
   Uther becomes her step-father, and he and Igraine have a son, Arthur,
   Morgaine's half-brother.

   When Morgaine is eleven years old and Arthur six, an attempt of murder
   is made on Arthur's life. Their maternal aunt, the high priestess
   Viviane, arrives in Caerleon and advises Uther to have Arthur fostered
   far away from the court for his own safety. Uther agrees, and also
   allows Viviane to take Morgaine to Avalon, where she is trained as a
   priestess of the Mother Goddess. During this period, Morgaine becomes
   aware of the rising tension between the old Pagan and the new Christian
   religions. After seven years of training, Morgaine is initiated as a
   priestess of the Mother, and Viviane begins grooming her as the next
   Lady of Avalon.

   Some months after her initiation, Morgaine is given in a fertility rite
   to the future high king of Britain. Their union is not meant to be
   personal, but rather a symbolic wedding between the future high king
   and the land he is to defend. The following morning, Morgaine and
   Arthur recognize each other and are horrified to realize what they have
   done. Two months later, Morgaine is devastated to find that she is
   pregnant.

   After Uther dies in battle against the Saxon invaders, Arthur claims
   the throne of Britain despite questions about his legitimacy (he had
   been conceived within days of Igraine's marriage to Uther Pendragon).
   Since Arthur must now defend Britain against the Saxons, Viviane has
   Morgaine make him an enchanted scabbard that will prevent him from
   losing blood and gives him the sacred sword Excalibur. With the
   combined force of Avalon and Caerleon, Arthur repels the invaders.

   As Morgaine's unborn child grows within her, so do her feelings of
   anger and betrayal toward Viviane, who she believes tricked her into
   bearing a child to her own half-brother. Unable to stay in Avalon any
   longer, she leaves for the court of her aunt Morgause, queen of
   Lothian, where she bears her son, naming him Gwydion. Spurred by her
   husband Lot's ambition and her own, Morgause tricks Morgaine into
   allowing her to rear her son. To escape Lot's unwanted advances,
   Morgaine leaves Lothian and returns to Arthur's court as a
   lady-in-waiting to the high queen, Gwenhwyfar. She does not see Gwydion
   again until he is grown and a Druid priest.

   When Gwenhwyfar fails to produce an heir, she is convinced God is
   punishing her for her sins. Chiefest among them, as she believes, are
   her failure to persuade Arthur to outlaw pagan religious practice in
   Britain and her forbidden love for Galahad, Arthur's cousin and finest
   knight, who is also known as Lancelet. Although Lancelet reciprocates
   Gwenhwyfar's love, he is also Arthur's friend and an honorable man.
   This situation causes terrible suffering to both Lancelet and
   Gwenhwyfar.

   On the eve of a decisive battle against the Saxons, Gwenhwyfar prevails
   upon Arthur to put aside his father's Pendragon banner and replace it
   with her own Christian banner. As her religious fanaticism grows,
   relations between Avalon and Camelot grow strained. Still, in her
   desperation over her failure to carry a child to term, she asks
   Morgaine for help, threatening to have an extramarital affair so she
   can become pregnant. In an attempt to keep Gwenhwyfar from doing so,
   Morgaine reveals that Arthur already has a son, though he does not know
   it.

   After the battle, Arthur moves his court to Camelot, which is more
   easily defended than Caerleon had been. Seeking to free both Lancelet
   and Gwenhwyfar from the forbidden love that traps them both, Morgaine
   tricks Lancelet into marrying Gwenhwyfar's cousin, Elaine. Some time
   later, during a heated argument with Arthur over their lack of an heir,
   Gwenhwyfar breaks Morgaine's confidence and tells Arthur he has a son.
   In growing suspicion and horror, Arthur summons Morgaine and orders her
   to tell him the truth. Morgaine obeys. Now believing that the lack of a
   royal heir is God's punishment for Arthur's union, however unwitting,
   with his own half-sister, Gwenhwyfar urges Arthur to confess the
   encounter to the bishop, who imposes strict penance upon him. Then she
   and Arthur arrange for Morgaine to marry into Wales, far from Camelot.
   But because of a misunderstanding, Morgaine, who had thought she would
   be marrying the king's younger son Accolon, a Druid priest and warrior,
   finds herself betrothed to King Uriens of Wales, who is old enough to
   be her grandfather. Arthur yearns to meet his son Gwydion and perhaps
   foster him at Camelot, but each time he brings up the subject with
   Gwenhwyfar, she refuses to discuss it.

   Morgaine marries Uriens and moves to Wales, but in time begins an
   affair with Accolon. The "old people" of the hills, who keep to the old
   pagan ways, regard Accolon and Morgaine as their king and queen. King
   Uriens suspects nothing, but Accolon's older brother, Avalloch, begins
   to; at one point, he confronts Morgaine in private and tries to
   blackmail her into sleeping with him as well. Morgaine sends Avalloch
   out on a boar hunt and is magically present when the boar kills him. In
   his grief for his eldest son and heir, Uriens abstains from pork for
   the rest of his life. Morgaine tells Accolon, who is now Uriens's heir,
   of the sacred marriage she made with Arthur years before. She adds that
   they must take the kingdom back from Arthur and the Christians and
   bring it back under the sway of Avalon. The attempted coup fails and
   Arthur kills Accolon in single combat. As Uriens recovers from the
   shock of losing a second son, Morgaine leaves Wales forever.

   Gwydion, now grown, goes to the Saxon courts to learn warfare far from
   Arthur's eye. Impressed by his cleverness, the Saxons name him Mordred
   ("Evil Counsel"). Years later, at a Pentecost feast at Camelot, he
   introduces himself as Queen Morgaine's son and Queen Morgause's foster
   son, though he calls Queen Morgause "Mother" and Morgaine by her name.
   Because of his close resemblance to Lancelet, he must often tell people
   that Lancelet is not his father. To earn his knighthood with no
   suspicion of preferential treatment, Gwydion challenges Lancelet to
   single combat during a tourney and they fight. As they start to fight
   in earnest, Gwenhwyfar, who has warmed to Gwydion in the meantime,
   protests and Arthur interrupts the match. Lancelet makes Gwydion a
   knight of the Round Table, naming him Mordred.

   Morgaine returns to Camelot under guise with another sister of Avalon
   during another Pentacost festival. Wielding great magic, Morgaine and
   her sister make manifest the Holy Grail--one of the sacred regalia of
   Avalon. The assembled court sees the manifestation of the Grail as a
   holy revelation. When the knights of the Round Table leave to search
   for the Holy Grail, Mordred attempts to usurp the throne. In a
   climactic battle, the armies of Arthur and Mordred fight and Arthur is
   mortally wounded. Morgaine takes the dying Arthur through the mists to
   Avalon, reassuring him that he did not fail in his attempt to save
   Britain from the approaching dark times. Arthur dies in her arms as the
   shoreline comes into view. Morgaine buries him in Avalon and remains
   there to tell the tale of Camelot.
