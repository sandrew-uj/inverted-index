   The poem begins as an old sorcerer departs his workshop, leaving his
   apprentice with chores to perform. Tired of fetching water by pail, the
   apprentice enchants a broom to do the work for him, using magic in
   which he is not fully trained. The floor is soon awash with water, and
   the apprentice realizes that he cannot stop the broom because he does
   not know the magic required to do so.

   The apprentice splits the broom in two with an axe, but each of the
   pieces becomes a whole broom that takes up a pail and continues
   fetching water, now at twice the speed. At this increased pace, the
   entire room quickly begins to flood. When all seems lost, the old
   sorcerer returns and quickly breaks the spell. The poem concludes with
   the old sorcerer's statement that only a master should invoke powerful
   spirits.
