   "The Tell-Tale Heart" is a first-person narrative told by an unnamed
   narrator. Despite insisting that they are sane, the narrator suffers
   from a disease (nervousness) which causes "over-acuteness of the
   senses".

   The old man, with whom the narrator lives, has a clouded, pale, blue
   "vulture-like" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so
   much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also
   insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator is
   insistent that this careful precision in committing the murder proves
   that they cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator
   opens the door of the old man's room to shine a sliver of light onto
   the "evil eye." However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed,
   making it impossible to "do the work," thus making the narrator go
   further into distress.

   On the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand
   slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual.
   The narrator does not draw back and after some time, decides to open
   the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely
   on the "evil eye," revealing that it is wide open. The narrator hears
   the old man's heart beating, which only gets louder and louder. This
   increases the narrator's anxiety to the point where the narrator
   decides to strike. He jumps into the room and the old man shrieks once
   before he is killed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals
   the pieces under the floorboards, ensuring the concealment of all signs
   of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a
   neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look
   around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's
   own in a nightmare and that the old man is absent in the country.
   Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the
   narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room. The
   chairs are placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the
   police suspect nothing, and the narrator has a pleasant and easy
   manner.

   The narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the
   narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator concludes
   that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the
   floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the
   officers do not seem to hear it. Terrified by the violent beating of
   the heart and convinced that the officers are aware of not only the
   heartbeat but also the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and
   confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal
   the remains of the old man's body.
