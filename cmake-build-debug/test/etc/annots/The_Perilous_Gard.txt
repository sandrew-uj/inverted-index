   The Perilous Gard takes place in England during the 1550s. The lead
   character, Kate Sutton, is a lady-in-waiting to Princess Elizabeth (the
   later Queen Elizabeth I of England). Her sister, Alicia, inadvertently
   gets her exiled to a castle named Elvenwood Hall, also known as the
   Perilous Gard, where she finds that the daughter of Sir Geoffrey Heron,
   the master of the hall, vanished under mysterious circumstances that
   implicate his brother, Christopher Heron. Kate soon discovers that,
   although the seeming death of little Cecily was an accident,
   Christopher is still so overwhelmed with grief that he has exiled
   himself from castle life. When Kate learns of the local villagers'
   fears that the "Fairy Folk" will kidnap their children, she guesses
   that Cecily might not be dead after all. She tells Christopher of her
   suspicions, and he, unbeknownst to Kate, comes up with a desperate plan
   to save Cecily. Meanwhile, Kate stumbles into the underground world of
   the Fairy Folk, who intend to use Christopher's desperation to their
   own advantage. The Fairy Folk are ruled by the Lady in Green, who
   believes that only a sacrifice can help her people hold their own
   against the advancing modern world.

   Kate detests the Lady in Green at first, but the two of them have much
   in common. Both are strong-willed, highly independent, and capable of
   enormous self-discipline. Kate's refusal to be drugged or manipulated
   in other ways soon gains her a measure of respect among the Fairy Folk.
   Little by little she gains knowledge of their underground kingdom,
   while her view of the Lady in Green gradually changes. Kate begins to
   understand and even to respect the Lady in Green. In the end, however,
   Kate chooses to leave the Fairy Folk in order to save Christopher,
   destroying the fairy kingdom in the process. Christopher then takes
   Cecily to London to live with his sister Jennifer. When Christopher
   returns he proposes to Kate, and she accepts. Kate is granted freedom
   when Queen Elizabeth I ascends the throne.
