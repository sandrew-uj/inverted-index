   The plot opens some time after the Moon Wars, where things for the
   original cast have taken a turn for the worse. The main character and
   pilot of Getter-1, Ryoma Nagare, has been framed for the murder of the
   Getter Machine builder Dr. Saotome after the death of Saotome's
   daughter, Michiru. However, he is released from jail and is reunited on
   Earth--unhappily--with his old allies, Hayato Jin and Musashi Tomoe, to
   fight none other than Dr. Saotome himself, who has seemingly risen from
   the grave to threaten humanity with his ultimate creation--and most
   dangerous weapon, the Shin Getter Dragon. The Shin Getter Dragon is a
   massive weapon powered by the same cosmic Getter Rays which gave life
   to their machines. However, their efforts to stop Dr. Saotome (not to
   mention an overzealous Japanese Defense Force), are in vain, as nuclear
   weapons are used on Shin Dragon.

   The resulting explosion and shock wave of Getter Rays wipes out 99% of
   the human population worldwide. Thirteen years after this catastrophe,
   as humanity clings desperately to life, the re-emerged extraterrestrial
   invaders threaten planet Earth once more. The only safeguard against
   this alien threat is a giant robot that emerges from the wreckage of
   the nuclear blast--Shin Getter Robo--piloted by an artificially created
   human named Go. With the help of Hayato's Super Robot Army and Go's
   co-pilots Kei and Gai, Shin Getter fights to keep humanity's dreams
   alive.

   Later, Ryoma returns piloting the Black Getter Robo to aid the new
   Getter team against Dr. Saotome, who returns with Stinger and Cowen
   when Shin Getter Dragon re-activates and continues its evolution. It
   was also revealed that Kei was Dr. Saotome's younger daughter and
   Michiru's younger sister, who was adopted by Benkei. Soon the invaders
   put their true plan into action by transforming Jupiter into a Getter
   Ray Sun and Ganymede, one of its moons, would soon go on a collision
   course with Earth, prompting both the old and new Getter teams to
   spring into action to save the planet.
