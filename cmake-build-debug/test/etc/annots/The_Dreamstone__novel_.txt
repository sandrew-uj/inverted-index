   The Dreamstone begins in a forest called Ealdwood, the last remaining
   bastion of Faery on Earth. Once, the Sidhe had roamed the world freely,
   but when Man came and fought wars and spread evil, the dark Sidhe
   burrowed deep or hid in rivers and lakes, while the bright ones, the
   Daoine Sidhe left mortal Earth and returned to Faery. But one bright
   one, Arafel chose to remain behind and guard Ealdwood, the last
   untouched forest. Men avoided Ealdwood because those who ventured in
   never came out again.

   Arafel watched the coming and going of Men in the lands surrounding
   Ealdwood, but showed little interest in them, until one man sought
   shelter in the fringes of the forest. She confronted him and learned
   that his king at Dun na h-Eoin had been killed, and that he, Niall, was
   on the run from those who had seized power. Arafel tells him that he
   cannot stay in Ealdwood, but fearing for his safety, sends him to
   Beorc's Steading, a sanctuary hidden in a valley for "lostlings".^[3]

   Back in Ealdwood, another man stumbles into the forest. Arafel learns
   he is Fionn, the dead king's harper, fleeing Lord Evald of Caer Wiell.
   Evald had overthrown the king, taken his wife, Meara, and now claims
   Fionn's harp as his own. When Evald invades the forest in pursuit of
   Fionn, Arafel denies him access to the harper. Evald demands
   compensation for what he claims is his, and she gives him her
   dreamstone, a magical stone that preserves memories of the wearer.
   Evald returns to Caer Wiell and Arafel allows Fionn to stay in Ealdwood
   so she can listen to him sing. But the dreamstone Evald now wears
   causes both him and Arafel anguish: she can feel his ugly memories and
   evil, while he can feel her kindness and peace, which confuses him.
   When Fionn discovers what Arafel did, and the distress it is causing
   her, he leaves her to find Evald to trade his harp for her stone.
   Evald, driven mad by lust and kindness, invades Ealdwood again and
   meets Fionn. He gives Fionn the stone for the harp, but kills the
   harper out of spite. Arafel arrives too late to save Fionn and kills
   Evald with her silver sword. Devastated, Arafel recovers her dreamstone
   and retreats to Eald (Faery).

   When Niall learns of Lord Evald's death, he returns to Caer Wiell and
   seizes control. He offers Meara and her son by Evald, Evald junior,
   safety, and peace returns to Caer Wiell. Evald grows up and marries
   Meredydd, and when an aging Niall dies, Evald becomes Lord of Caer
   Wiell. A new king, Laochailan ascends to the throne, and is at war with
   An Beag. Lord Evald of Caer Wiell and brothers Donnchadh and Ciaran of
   Caer Donn agree to help the king reclaim control of Dun na h-Eoin. They
   win the battle, but Evald is worried that the retreating enemy will
   overrun Caer Wiell, and asks the king to let him return to defend it.
   The king refuses, but allows Ciaran to go. On his way to Caer Wiell,
   Ciaran is attacked at the edge of Ealdwood and flees into the forest.
   There he finds a tree with swords and jewels hanging from its branches.
   He takes one of the silver swords to defend himself, but Arafel
   intervenes and withdraws Ciaran into Eald. She realises that he is a
   halfling, a Man with elf blood in him, because no Man would find
   Cinniuint, the Tree of Swords and Jewels. Arafel explains to Ciaran
   that when the Daoine Sidhe withdrew to Faery they hung their swords and
   memory stones on the tree, and the sword he took belonged to an elf
   prince named Liosliath. She gives Ciaran Liosliath's jewel stone,
   similar to Arafel's dreamstone.

   Ciaran tells Arafel he must honor his commitment to help Caer Wiell,
   and she takes him, via Faery, to the keep. Caer Wiell is besieged by An
   Beag, and Ciaran helps in its defence, assuring its people that their
   Lord Evald and the king will return to free them. As Caer Wiell's siege
   worsens, Ciaran calls Arafel for help via the stone, unaware of the
   dangers in summoning the Sidhe. Arafel reluctantly responds, knowing
   that she will wake the Sidhe's ancient enemies. She arms Ciaran and
   gives him an elf horse, and together they battle An Beag and ancient
   creatures who have aligned with the enemy. By the time the king and
   Lord Evald return, the battle is over, the dark forces are defeated and
   Arafel, free again after completing her task, has returned to Eald.

   Everyone now sees Ciaran as an elf prince and fear him. The king
   returns to Dun na h-Eoin and Donnchadh to Caer Donn, both refusing to
   associate with Ciaran. Only Branwyn, Evald's daughter, accepts him, and
   Ciaran takes her to Ealdwood. He returns Liosliath's dreamstone to
   Arafel and the Sidhe blesses them both and Caer Wiell.
