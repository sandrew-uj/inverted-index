   The series takes place principally in the castle and province of
   Southmarch. Prominent sub-plots cover connected events to the south and
   north of Southmarch, respectively in the land of Xis and the Qar
   (faerie) lands beyond the impassable Shadowline. The action centers on
   the troubled Eddon family, the rulers of Southmarch, which is the
   nearest human province to the Shadowline and was formerly held by the
   Qar prior to their expulsion by the advancing humans.

   The novel begins with the king, Olin Eddon, imprisoned in a foreign
   land. His eldest son Kendrick is struggling to rule in his place, while
   his younger twins, Barrick and Briony, struggle with their adolescent
   emotions. The male twin, Barrick, is particularly troubled by
   depression and nightmares, incited by his private knowledge of a
   mysterious family curse. When Kendrick is assassinated, Briony
   shoulders the burden of ruling in her father's absence, while Barrick
   slips further into maudlin self-obsession.

   An army of Qar cross the Shadowline to invade Southmarch, and in the
   climactic battle of the first book Barrick is lost in the land of the
   Qar. Briony narrowly escapes death when the throne is usurped by her
   cousin. While Barrick travels in the Shadowlands, Briony travels around
   her own lands incognito, seeking allies.

   Incidents in the second book elucidate that the three main religions -
   those of the Qar, the northern humans, and the Xixian humans - are
   based on a violent feud within a pantheon of gods. The three
   contemporary religions, though seemingly unrelated, each stem from a
   different perspective on the Godswar, which ended in the victory of
   three brothers.

   The Godswar began when one of the gods married a goddess of the
   competing faction, prompting her father and brothers to go to war to
   reclaim her. It is suggested in the course of the second novel that in
   fact she eloped, and her father, disapproving of her choice, fought to
   abduct her from her beloved. Long after the end of the Godswar, a child
   of the losing faction staged an attack on those who won, sending them
   to sleep; this allowed the rise of mortal civilizations.

   As Barrick travels in the lands of Qar he uncovers more of their
   beliefs, including that they hold both knowledge and power descended
   directly from their patron god, via a supernatural gift called the
   Fireflower.

   Qar culture is revealed to center around a ruling family who are
   descended from one of the gods and who pass the Fireflower down through
   their generations. This family practices incestuous marriage, with each
   generation producing exactly one male and one female child. In order to
   preserve the Fireflower, which sustains the Qar, each generation of
   this family must present itself on reaching adulthood to the last
   remnant of a god still in the world who is trapped and barely alive in
   a cave deep below Southmarch Castle.

   Barrick learns that unbeknownst to the contemporary Eddons, this
   arrangement was discreetly tolerated by the dwarf-like Funderlings
   until one of the Eddon ancestors met and desired the Qar princess on
   her pilgrimage. They married under disputed circumstances. She is
   remembered by the humans as a queen of Southmarch, but her Qar ancestry
   is forgotten.

   She was, therefore, unable to marry and procreate with her brother.
   This broke the chain connecting the Qar to the slumbering god and began
   their long period of decline. Their siege of Southmarch is intended to
   regain control of the castle and the slumbering god beneath, in the
   hope of restoring their race.

   On the southern continent, the powerful but insane Autarch of Xis also
   desires the power of the gods beneath Southmarch castle, whose
   existence he has deduced from ancient texts. In order to access that
   power he requires someone descended from a god and therefore has
   procured the imprisonment of King Olin Eddon. He is revealed to be
   behind much of the turmoil in Southmarch.

   At the climax of the series, in the third and fourth novels, several
   factions compete for possession of Southmarch castle, and the deep
   caves beneath. The Autarch, who has launched a rapid marine invasion of
   the province; the Qar, who have tired of their siege and attempted to
   storm the castle; the usurper, holding the castle with his own designs
   on the slumbering god; and two forces loyal to the Eddons, one a large
   army recruited by Briony advancing on the castle to lift the siege,
   another consisting mainly of Funderlings holding their caves beneath
   the castle, initially unaware of what sleeps further below.

   An eventual alliance between the Qar and the Eddon loyalists drives out
   the usurper but fails to prevent the Autarch from gaining access to the
   cave of the slumbering gods. One of the gods is woken, but easily
   transcends the Autarch's control. The alliance of loyalists and Qar
   eventually succeeds in defeating the god.

   Briony Eddon is restored to her throne. Her brother Barrick, who like
   all Eddons is descended from the Qar royal line and had accepted the
   Fireflower into himself during his time with the Qar, hopes that he can
   restore the line his ancestor broke and allow the Qar to survive.
