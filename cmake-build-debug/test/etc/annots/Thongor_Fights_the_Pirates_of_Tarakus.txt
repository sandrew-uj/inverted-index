   Kashtar, ruler of the pirate city-state of Tarakus, joins forces with a
   wizard who has dabbled in the forbidden secrets of lost Nianga, among
   them, a ray that causes madness--"the Gray Death," as it is known to
   its victims. With it, Kashtar hopes to conquer all Lemuria, and
   incidentally escape having his realm absorbed into the growing empire
   of Patanga, ruled by the upstart barbarian conqueror Thongor.

   After Kashtar takes the best ship in Patanga's fleet and captures
   Thongor's old friend Karm Karvus, Thongor determines to free him and
   gain intelligence by sneaking into Tarakus. Posing as a crewman of
   Barim Redbeard, the pirate captain who helped his son escape Kashtar in
   the previous volume, he suits deed to word, only to be separated from
   his allies before he can reach his goal. He has to continue on to his
   goal on his own.

   As Thongor approaches the city, he meets Karm Karvus, who has escaped
   on his own along with an imprisoned princess, and learns the pirate
   invasion fleet has set out for Patanga. Fortunately, they are able to
   link up again with Barim's ship and infiltrate the fleet as originally
   intended. Taking the ship bearing the death ray, they turn it on the
   enemy's own vessels. Once Tarakus is defeated in battle, it is annexed
   to Thongor's empire.

   The book includes a frontispiece map by the author of part of Lemuria
   and concludes with an "Author's Note."
