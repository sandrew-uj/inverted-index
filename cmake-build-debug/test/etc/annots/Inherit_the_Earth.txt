   In a far future, mankind is extinct and Earth is populated by several
   tribes of anthropomorphic animals - collectively referred to as the
   Morph - who have achieved a level of technology and societal
   sophistication roughly equivalent to Europe in the High Middle Ages.
   The humans are enshrined in legends as having been the ones who gave
   the Morph prehensile hands, mouths capable of speech, and the ability
   to think and feel, but the Morph have very little understanding of
   their long-lost forebears, who exist now only in stories, ruins and a
   few technological relics.

   The game begins with the protagonist, Rif of the Fox Tribe, being
   falsely accused of having stolen the Orb of Storms (a technological
   relic of humankind which is able to predict the weather), primarily
   based on the fact that he was one of only two foxes in the area at the
   time of the theft. Rif volunteers to look for the Orb himself, and is
   given assistance and guards in the form of Eeah of the Elk Guard and
   Okk of the Boar Tribe. The Boar King takes Rif's girlfriend Rhene
   hostage as insurance.

   The trio travel throughout the Known Lands over the course of their
   investigation. Along the way, they encounter the various Tribes under
   the protection of the Forest King (the Elk Tribe ruler who exerts
   hegemonic control over the whole region), some of which have other Orbs
   containing other knowledge left behind by the humans. With the
   assistance of Sist, the leader of the Rats, they eventually discover
   that the Orb of Storms was stolen by a Raccoon, an animal rarely seen
   in the Known Lands. Sist also reveals that the Boar King has formed an
   alliance with the Wolves who live far to the north.

   Riff, Okk, and Eeah attempt to pass into the Wild Lands, the untamed
   regions to the north, but are apprehended by Prince, the ruler of the
   castle in which the Dogs have sequestered themselves. Rif escapes, and
   eventually secures the help of Alama, a Cat hermit, and a tribe of
   wildcats to free his friends.

   The trio then travel further north, to the isolated island claimed by
   the Wolves, where they learn that the Raccoon, Chota, has manipulated
   the Wolves' politics and stolen the Orb to take over the Known Lands,
   as the Orb of Storms is the key to a system left behind by the humans
   to control the weather. In Chota's fortress, a human hydroelectric dam,
   Rif, Okk and Eeah outwit their enemies, and Chota and the Orb are
   presumed lost. They return to the Known Lands, where Rif convinces the
   Tribes to work together, so that they will no longer need the Orbs to
   make their lives better. The Forest King take his advice, promotes Okk
   and Eeah, and releases Rhene.

   However, the Orb of Storms was not destroyed, and is preparing to
   initiate Chota's final command to begin a long drought, awaiting input
   on the ending date of the drought.
