   The novel begins with nuclear war breaking out between the submarine
   fleets of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The President, wracked with
   guilt over his role in the carnage, prepares to input a series of codes
   into a computer for the activation of an unknown device known only as
   "Talons". Seconds before the activation process can be completed, a
   burning Greyhound bus, sent flying by the shock waves of the nuclear
   blasts below, smashes through the Airborne Command Post and causes it
   to crash. The novel follows three groups of characters in the aftermath
   of the war.

   After his car breaks down at a Kansas gas station, wrestler Josh
   Hutchins meets a 9-year-old girl named Sue Wanda (Swan) and her mother.
   The three take cover in the gas station's basement along with the
   clerk, PawPaw, after missiles are launched from hidden silos nearby.
   Meanwhile, 13-year-old Roland Croninger is taken by his parents to Blue
   Dome Mountain, a survivalist fallout shelter run by Colonel James
   "Jimbo" Macklin. An off-course Minuteman missile detonates nearby,
   severely damaging Blue Dome. Finally, in New York City, a homeless
   woman named Sister Creep wanders through the ruins, discovering a
   mysterious glass ring. She encounters an antagonistic shapeshifting
   being called "The Man With The Scarlet Eye", and finds herself dodging
   him on her subsequent travels.

   In Kansas, Swan's mother and PawPaw both die, but not before PawPaw
   tells Josh to "protect the Child". Soon after, Josh notices that there
   is grass growing where Swan slept in their shelter, realizing that she
   has special powers. They soon meet Leona Skelton, a psychic whose
   husband, Davy, is dying of radiation poisoning. Leona reads Swan's
   future with tarot cards and predicts that she is going to face the
   Devil. After Davy dies, Leona joins their group. The three later come
   across a strangely well-lit and well-stocked K-Mart, which turns out to
   be a trap laid by escaped inmates from a nearby mental hospital. After
   a fatally wounded Leona sacrifices herself to allow Josh and Swan to
   escape, the pair find an abandoned circus train and befriend Rusty, an
   ex-rodeo rider/clown.

   At Blue Dome, Roland is recruited into rescuing Macklin from a
   life-threatening situation. Eventually Macklin faces an armed revolt by
   a former follower, Schorr, which includes Roland's parents. Macklin and
   Roland kill the insurgents and escape the compound, traveling south to
   Salt Lake, Utah. There, the duo secure a deal to join a survivor
   community led by an individual called The Fat Man. Soon afterwards,
   however, Roland kills The Fat Man when the latter attempts to drug and
   rape him. Macklin and Roland subsequently take over the community.

   After they leave New York through the Holland Tunnel, all but one of
   Sister's survivor group is massacred by The Man With the Scarlet Eye.
   Sister escapes west, where she is rescued from a wolf attack by Paul
   Thorsen, a divorced ex-professor turned mountain man. Sister and Paul
   spend the next seven years criss-crossing the irradiated wasteland of
   postwar America, following visions Sister sees through the glass ring.
   In that time, both of them - as well as the other principal characters
   - eventually develop "Job's Mask", a gradual tumor-like disfigurement
   which covers the head in fleshy tissue.

   In seven years, Macklin and Roland forge their group into the Army of
   Excellence (AOE), which expands east and raids settlements for
   supplies. Roland has assumed leadership of the AOE, with Macklin
   serving as a figurehead. They decide to take the AOE to West Virginia's
   Warwick Mountain upon hearing from a torture subject, Brother Timothy,
   that another army is heading there. Brother Timothy claims that God
   sheltered him at Warwick Mountain and he has a silver key, a phrase,
   and a black box that could destroy the world. Meanwhile, Sister and
   Paul meet Hugh Ryan, an alcoholic former doctor who lost his leg to an
   AOE attack years prior. Hugh convinces Sister to let him join her and
   Paul. Later they meet a group of orphans led by 17-year-old Robin
   Oates, and earn the orphans' trust after the glass ring helps Hugh
   successfully perform surgery on a young boy.

   Swan, Josh, and Rusty, performing as traveling entertainers, stop at a
   house in the middle of an orchard where all the trees save for one has
   been cut down. The couple in the house explain that the one tree was
   special and that they just didn't have the heart to cut down. Swan
   places her hands on the tree and is shocked to feel it is still alive.
   She uses her powers to "wake up" the tree, causing it to be covered
   with blossoms the next morning. The Man with the Scarlet Eye finds out
   about Swan and decides that she is a threat to him, travelling to her
   group's next stop at the settlement of Mary's Rest. There, he nearly
   kills an incapacitated Swan, but Rusty interferes and is fatally burned
   as a result.

   Upon arriving in Mary's Rest with Paul, Sister realizes that the ring
   has been leading her to Swan. When Swan touches the ring, she sees a
   vision of a land covered with plants, orchards, fruit, and flowers,
   realizing this is her life's goal. The vision causes Swan's Job's Mask
   to break up and fall off, revealing a beautiful woman with fiery red
   hair. Other people's Job's Masks are also healed. Josh becomes close
   with a local woman, Glory, and her son Aaron. Swan and Robin begin to
   fall in love. Aaron figures out how to use the dowsing rod, Crybaby,
   and it indicates a source of fresh untainted water. The man with the
   apple tree drives into town with a truckload of ripe apples and tosses
   them to a happy crowd. Swan and the residents of Mary's Rest decide to
   plant an apple orchard to go along with the cornfield, which sprung up
   almost overnight and is growing vigorously.

   The Man with the Scarlet Eye introduces himself as "Friend" to the Army
   of Excellence and diverts them to Mary's Rest with promises of clean
   water and Swan's ability to grow food. They attack the town. Many
   residents, including Paul, are killed, and the AOE take Josh, Sister,
   Swan, Robin, and others captive. Swan and Sister are brought to
   Macklin, whose Mask has fallen off to reveal a hideous death's head.
   Friend attempts to get the location of the glass ring from Sister, but
   is unable to get past her mental guards. Even under threat of the
   torture of her friends, Swan refuses to do anything for the AOE. She
   and Sister are thrown in with Sheila. Robin and Josh are kept as
   leverage on Swan and the AOE continues towards Warwick Mountain.

   Several weeks later, the AOE runs out of supplies and a much reduced
   army arrives at Warwick Mountain. Croninger's Job's Mask reveals a
   twisted horror which he continues to hide under bandages. He shifts his
   allegiance to Friend. Brother Timothy guides Sister, Swan, Friend,
   Macklin, and Croninger to "God's" bunker. Sister notices God's
   cufflinks and recognizes him as the former President of the United
   States, who survived the crash, yet has now gone insane. The bunker is
   revealed to house "Talons," also known as the Tactical Long Range
   Nuclear Sanitizer. It's a doomsday weapon which, when activated will
   launch a final barrage of nuclear weapons from two orbital missile
   platforms onto the Earth's icecaps. This will cause the Earth's poles
   to shift while simultaneously flooding the world over with melted ice,
   completely destroying all life on Earth. The President has been waiting
   for any indication that the world is going to be ruled by good or evil.
   Seeing that evil appears to have won, the President activates Talons,
   much to the delight of Friend, who sees this as an opportunity to
   destroy the world, and Swan, once and for all. Friend then kills the
   President to prevent him from deactivating the launch sequence, gloats
   about the situation, reveals his true face, tells Roland "I have always
   walked alone" and leaves, presumably to find a place to watch the
   destruction. Sister fights with Croninger, who shoots her and almost
   shoots Swan before being attacked by a conscience-stricken Macklin.
   They take each other down. Swan figures out the deactivation sequence
   and disarms the launch computer. She and Sister are rescued by Josh and
   Robin, who broke out of captivity shortly after the AOE arrived at
   Warwick Mountain.

   They leave the bunker, locking it behind them and throwing away the
   key. Mortally wounded, Sister notices her shadow and begs to be taken
   where she can see the sun. Josh, Swan, and Robin take her to a clearing
   where they watch the end of the nuclear winter as the clouds break up
   and the sun comes out. Sister tells Swan to work fast to wake up the
   earth. She then dies. Swan, Josh, and Robin bury her and climb down the
   mountain. They find the AOE in chaos and are there encountered once
   more by Friend who has taken the form of an AOE officer. Swan gives him
   the severed replacement hand of Colonel Macklin, and says that she
   forgives him for his actions as without him they would never have found
   Talons or been able to stop worldwide destruction. Enraged, Friend
   orders the AOE to kill her but upon seeing Macklin's hand, they realize
   that the Colonel is dead and begin to crowd and attack Friend in a bid
   to claim the hand for themselves and become the leader of the AOE.
   Josh, Swan and Robin leave in a truck with Sheila and a few other RL's
   and soldiers while a pack of wolves descends from the mountain and
   surrounds the AOE camp. They come across a farmer and his family
   planting seeds who offer them hospitality. Josh tells Swan that she
   needs to start her work here, but he is going ahead to Mary's Rest. He
   arrives to the welcoming arms of Glory and Aaron.

   The story ends with humanity struggling back toward civilization,
   building settlements, and restoring order. The armies of violence
   become disorganized and dissolve away. News of Swan's ability to wake
   up the Earth is spread throughout the land almost as if it were legend.
   Settlements begin to trade again and contact is restored with peoples
   even as far away as Russia. Humanity now dedicates itself to passing on
   the most important lesson learned from the nuclear holocaust, "never
   again !" Swan and Robin eventually make it to Mary's Rest
   and have twins named Joshua and Sister. Swan continues her work healing
   the land, fostering cooperation, and bringing hope to humankind.
