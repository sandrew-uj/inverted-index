   A human ship is sent to investigate a distress signal sent 212 years
   ago from the previously unknown planet. The mother ship is destroyed
   and nearly all of the crew killed in a surprise missile attack (in some
   editions the mother ship and its crew do not appear). Only two scouts
   survive, crash-landing on Tschai in their damaged scout-boat. After his
   companion is killed by human nomads early on, Adam Reith is left
   stranded alone on an unknown world. The four books describe the
   attempts of a man of singularly strong will and resource to return to
   Earth: in the first book to recover his damaged spacecraft, in the
   second to steal one, in the third to build one, and in the fourth to
   escape the Pnume, by whom he is kidnapped before he can depart Tschai.
   In the process, he overcomes the obstacles of dealing with four
   different alien races and various human groups, often profoundly
   disrupting the societies, human and alien, with which he is forced to
   deal.

   Reith acquires two faithful human companions in the course of his
   travels: Traz Onmale, the dour, proud boy-chieftain of a nomad race
   obsessed with emblems, and a renegade Dirdirman, Ankhe at Afram Anacho,
   who is loquacious, fastidious and flamboyant. (Vance has said that the
   novels were commissioned as a juvenile series, which was why he
   included Traz;^[citation needed] but the action is no less 'adult' than
   in his other works.) Anacho and Traz play lesser roles in the fourth
   book, which chronicles Reith's adventures in the underground world of
   the Pnume, and subsequently on the surface with the rescued Pnumekin
   woman Zap 210. Romantic interest is provided both by Zap 210 and by the
   aristocratic Flower of Cath, who features in the first two novels. The
   third novel also introduces a villain in the fat and avaricious
   contractor Aila Woudiver.

   Tschai, like Earth, is a world of several discrete continents. The
   action covers most of the planet, and the second and fourth books
   describe lengthy sea voyages taken by Reith and his companions. Vance
   described blue-water sailing as one of his favorite recreations.

   The vast teeming planet with its clashing civilizations and
   multifarious cultures affects Reith to the point that he realizes that
   if he succeeds in returning to Earth, his life will seem dull and
   colourless in comparison.
