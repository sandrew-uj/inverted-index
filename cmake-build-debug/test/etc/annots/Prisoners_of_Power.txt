   Maxim Kammerer is a young amateur space explorer from Earth, regarded
   as a failure by his friends and relatives because this occupation is
   not considered to be a serious pursuit. The novel starts when he
   accidentally discovers an unexplored planet Saraksh inhabited by a
   humanoid race. The atmospheric conditions on Saraksh are such that the
   inhabitants believe that they live inside a sphere. The level of
   technological development on the planet is similar to mid-20th century
   Earth. The planet recently came through big nuclear and conventional
   war and the predicament of the population is dire. When Maxim lands,
   the natives mistake his small spaceship for a weapon and destroy it.

   At first he doesn't take his situation seriously, imagining himself a
   Robinson Crusoe stranded on an island inhabited by primitive but
   friendly natives. He is looking forward to establishing contact and
   befriending the population of the planet. However, the reality turns
   out to be far from glamorous. After being captured by armed natives and
   initially taken to what appears to be a concentration camp, Kammerer is
   sent to some governmental research institute which treats him as a
   mental patient. He escapes and finds himself in the capital of a
   totalitarian state, perpetually at war with its neighbors. The city is
   grim and polluted, with police and military omnipresent.

   He makes friends among the ordinary people that lead the life of
   privation and misery, while twice daily everyone is overcome by sudden
   an unexplained bouts of ecstatic enthusiasm, proclaiming their total
   allegiance and undying gratitude to the country's hidden rulers, known
   as the Unknown Fathers (in the censored versions Fire-bearing
   Creators), who are said to have the best interests of the people at
   heart, serving as bulwark against threats foreign and domestic, mainly
   from the so called degens (degenerates), the uncompromising enemies of
   the people, the terrorists who sometimes blow up the anti-ballistic
   missile (ABM) towers strewn around the country.

   All this makes little sense to Maxim, since his own society is free
   from war, hostility, crime and material shortages. Still confused about
   the official ideology, Kammerer gets enlisted in the military, to serve
   and protect the state and its people. He is ordered to execute some
   captured degens, one of them a woman. When he refuses, he is shot
   multiple times, survives, and joins the underground which consists of
   the degens who suffer great headaches twice daily. Degens believe that
   the ABM towers are responsible for that.

   Maxim participates in an attack on one such tower. Captured, tried and
   sent to a concentration camp in the South, the same one where he has
   made his landing, he is finally revealed the truth about the towers by
   a fellow prisoner high ranking member of the underground. They turn out
   to be broadcasting a mind control signal, employed by the Fathers to
   control the population.

   The constant low-intensity broadcast suppresses the ability of most
   people to evaluate information critically, making the omnipresent
   regime propaganda much more effective. In addition, twice a day an
   intense signal relieves mental stresses caused by the disconnect
   between the propaganda and the observed reality by inducing euphoria in
   the susceptible majority, and intense headaches in others who are
   immune to the signal's coercive power. Those are the only
   sober-thinking people in the country, including both the underground
   degens and the Fathers themselves.

   Astonished and appalled by this revelation, Kammerer makes it his
   mission to rid the planet of the mind control broadcast system. Several
   of his schemes fail because the cure may be worse than the disease. He
   escapes to the radioactive South in hopes of organizing an invasion,
   but the mutants dwelling there are weakly and softhearted, and the
   tribes further South are ruthless barbarians. He then turns to the
   state's neighbor -- the Island Empire -- but abandons this plan after
   finding documents on a destroyed Empire submarine that describe mass
   killings and other atrocities that the Empire military routinely
   perpetrates.

   He now focuses on trying to find and destroy the Control Center where
   the mind control broadcasts originate. Meanwhile, the Fathers decide to
   start a small victorious war on the country's northern neighbor, Honti.
   Kammerer surrenders to local gendarmes and is assigned to a penal
   battalion that is supposed to lead the invasion of the North. In this
   abortive action, most of his friends perish while Kammerer himself
   barely escapes annihilation in retaliatory nuclear blasts. Having
   served in the war, he earns himself a rehabilitation from the state and
   is installed in a secret research institution at the behest of a
   powerful Father known as the Wanderer, who remains out of reach.

   A Father known as the Smarty realizes that Kammerer is not affected by
   the broadcasts in any way and plots to use him to stage a coup and take
   over the state. His plan is for Kammerer to capture the Control Center
   and use its transmissions to incapacitate his rivals and install him as
   the new ruler in the minds of the population. The Center is protected
   by intense depression-inducing local broadcast field that makes it
   impossible for any native to penetrate it. The Smarty reveals the
   Center's location to Kammerer, who plays along; however, after
   penetrating the Center, he destroys it instead, thus disabling the
   whole system countrywide.

   It is revealed that the powerful Father, the Wanderer, is in fact a
   human progressor named Rudolf Sikorski, carefully working in secret to
   gradually improve the lot of the people of Saraksh. His plans now
   ruined, the Wanderer finally catches up with Maxim and lambasts him for
   his interference. He describes the unanticipated consequences of
   Kammerer's rash actions: up to 20% of the people may die or go insane
   due to the withdrawal from the mind control signal; Saraksh faces
   famine, anarchy, widespread radioactive pollution, and looming invasion
   by the Island Empire which they planned to stop using the depression
   field. The Wanderer orders Kammerer to leave the planet but Maxim
   refuses and stays on, to help stabilize the situation. Despite the many
   upheavals that Saraksh has ahead of her, he is still glad he destroyed
   the Control Center because now the people can be in charge of their own
   destiny.
