   The Helliconia trilogy is a series of science fiction books by British
   writer Brian W. Aldiss, set on the Earth-like planet Helliconia. It is
   an epic chronicling the rise and fall of a civilisation over more than
   a thousand years as the planet progresses through its incredibly long
   seasons, which last for centuries.

   The trilogy consists of the books Helliconia Spring (published in
   1982), Helliconia Summer (1983), and Helliconia Winter (1985).
