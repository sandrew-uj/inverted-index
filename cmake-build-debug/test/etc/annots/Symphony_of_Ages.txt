   Fourteen-year-old Gwydion is transported into a nearly one and one half
   millennia distant past to the Isle of Serendair by the mysterious
   Meridion. There he meets and falls in love with the young farmer's
   daughter Emily. They want to marry, yet when Gwydion goes to propose,
   he is taken back to his own time by Meridion. The devastated Emily runs
   away from home in search of him.

   Rhapsody, lives in the town of Easton. A former prostitute, she studies
   to become a Namer and Singer, a profession which gives her semi-magical
   abilities. When she is pursued by the underlings of her former client
   Michael, who is obsessed with her, Rhapsody tries to enlist help of two
   Firbolg, accidentally renaming one of them, a ruthless assassin then
   called The Brother to Achmed the Snake. Against her will, she is forced
   by Achmed and his friend Grunthor to accompany them on a journey
   through the center of the Earth, along the root of Sagia, the Holy
   Tree.

   After a long time the three emerge on the opposite side of the Earth
   and learn that fourteen hundred years have passed. The lands in which
   they find themselves were settled by refugees from Serendair, which had
   been destroyed a very long time ago. Moreover, the original colonists,
   who sailed there with their king Gwylliam, crossed on their way from
   Serendair the meridian and thus became immortal (no longer aging, but
   still able to be killed or die of illness). Their descendants born
   already in the new lands are only extremely long-lived, though.

   The people from Serendair, called "Cymrians" by the natives, created a
   large, prosperous empire under the reign of King Gwylliam and his
   half-dragon wife, Anwyn, who held the titles of Lord and Lady Cymrian.
   Then the royal couple started to fight each other - the result was a
   great war between each of their followers, which lasted for many
   centuries. Now, several centuries after the war's end, the lands are
   divided in many independent domains.

   Rhapsody, Achmed and Grunthor, who had formed a strong friendship
   during their journey through the Earth, travel through the unknown
   territory, which should become their new home. They meet and befriend
   several natives - Llauron the Invoker, the manipulative High Priest of
   the Filidic order; Stephen Navarne, the kind widowed Duke of Navarne;
   and Ashe, a mysterious traveller with a magical sword and a dangerous
   secret.

   Achmed, accompanied by Grunthor and Rhapsody, travels to Canrif, the
   devastated former capital of the Cymrian Empire, now inhabited by the
   monster-like Firbolg. With force, wit and courage he seizes control of
   the place, uniting all Firbolg tribes and becoming a king of their
   realm, Ylorc.

   Soon it becomes apparent that something very strange is happening in
   the neighbouring countries - such as pointless bloody raids and
   kidnapping of children. This is the doing of a F'dor, a bloodthirsty
   fire demon from the Old World, bent on creating havoc and destruction.
   Rhapsody, Achmed and Grunthor team up to defeat the F'dor. Rhapsody
   finds again her childhood love - Ashe, who is in fact Gwydion of
   Manosse, grandson of Gwylliam and Anwyn. Together they are able to
   unite the Cymrians again - as the newly elected Lord and Lady Cymrian.

   The books following the original Rhapsody Trilogy (which consisted of
   Rhapsody, Prophecy and Destiny) describe the lives of the series heroes
   after a 3-year gap. Ashe and Rhapsody, now Lord and Lady Cymrian, are
   planning to start a family. Achmed and Grunthor continue to rebuild
   Ylorc to its former glory. Achmed's most important project is the
   restoration of an ancient machine called the Light Catcher, a device
   that could be very beneficial but also very dangerous. In the Sorbold
   Empire, which neighbours the Cymrian Alliance, the rich power-hungry
   merchant Talquist plots to become the new Emperor after murdering the
   Empress Dowager and her son, leaving the empire without an heir. Also,
   a new F'dor emerges. After a twist of events Rhapsody gives birth to a
   son, Meridion. Talquist becomes obsessed with capturing the baby,
   convinced that the "Child of Time" could bring him immortality. His
   actions ultimately lead to the beginning of a war.
