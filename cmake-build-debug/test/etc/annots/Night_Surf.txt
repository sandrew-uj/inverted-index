   On an August night on Anson Beach, New Hampshire, a group of former
   college students have survived a plague caused by a virus called A6, or
   "Captain Trips". They believe the virus spread out of Southeast Asia
   and wiped out most of humanity.

   The characters' outlook is grim. They encounter a delirious man dying
   of the plague and burn him on a pyre as a half-serious black-magic
   human sacrifice. The protagonist, Bernie, reflects upon this new world
   and reminisces about "the time before" when he went to Anson Beach in
   his youth, years before the plague. All the members of Bernie's group
   had survived a virus called A2, which supposedly made them immune to
   A6. But Needles reveals to Bernie that he has contracted A6. Bernie
   admits to himself that deep down they know that A2 is not a guarantee
   against A6 and that they will probably all be dead by Christmas.
   Bernie's girlfriend keeps up the pretense, accepting Bernie's
   explanation that Needles must have lied about having A2 so the others
   would not leave him behind.
