   The novel is set in the future, when Malthusian overpopulation on Earth
   has been averted by the invention of teleportation, called the
   "Ramsbotham jump," which is used to send Earth's excess population to
   colonize other planets. However, the costs of operating the device mean
   that the colonies are isolated from Earth until they can produce
   something to justify two-way trade. Because modern technology requires
   a supporting infrastructure, the colonists employ technology from the
   frontier era (such as horses instead of tractors).

   Rod Walker is a high school student who dreams of becoming a
   professional colonist. The final test of his Advanced Survival class is
   to stay alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days.
   Students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can
   carry, but they are otherwise completely on their own. They are told
   only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable.
   On test day, students walk through the Ramsbotham portal and find
   themselves alone on a strange planet, but reasonably close to the
   pickup point. Rod, acting on his older sister's advice, takes hunting
   knives and basic survival gear, rather than high-tech weaponry, on the
   grounds that the latter could make him overconfident. The last advice
   that the students receive is to "watch out for stobor."

   On the second day, Rod is ambushed and knocked unconscious by a thief.
   When he wakes up, all that he has left is a spare knife hidden under a
   bandage. In his desperate concentration on survival, he loses track of
   time. Eventually, he teams up with Jacqueline "Jack" Daudet, a student
   from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male. When she
   tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact, he
   realizes that something has gone wrong with the portal that was
   supposed to recover them and that they are stranded.

   They start recruiting others to build a settlement for long term
   survival and Rod becomes the de facto leader of a community that
   eventually grows to around 75 people. Disagreements reveal the need to
   elect a government for the new town. Rod has no taste for politics or
   administration and is happy to have Grant Cowper, an older college
   student and born politician, elected mayor. Grant proves to be much
   better at talking than at getting things done. Despite disagreeing with
   many of Grant's policies, Rod supports him. Grant ignores Rod's warning
   that they are living in a dangerously hard-to-defend location and that
   they should move to a cave system that he has found. When a species
   that had been thought to be harmless suddenly changes its behavior and
   stampedes through their camp, the settlement is devastated and Grant is
   killed. Rod is put back in charge.

   Heinlein tracks the social development of the frontier community of
   educated Westerners deprived of technology, followed by its abrupt
   dissolution when contact with Earth is reestablished. After nearly two
   years of isolation, the culture shock experienced by the survivors
   highlights for them and the reader the pain and uncertainty of becoming
   an adult by reversing the process abruptly. Each of the students
   returns from being a self-responsible member of an autonomous community
   to being regarded as a youth.

   All of the students go back to Earth willingly except for Rod, who has
   great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small but
   sovereign state to a teenager, who is casually brushed aside by the
   adult rescuers. However, his teacher (and now brother-in-law) and his
   sister persuade him to change his mind. His teacher also informs Rod
   that his warning against "stobor" ("robots" spelled backwards) was just
   a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet to instill fear
   and caution in the students, as all students receive the same warning,
   regardless of the planet they are sent to for the final exam.

   Years later, Rod is briefly depicted accomplishing his heart's desire.
   The novel's ending finds him preparing to lead a formal colonization
   party to another planet.
