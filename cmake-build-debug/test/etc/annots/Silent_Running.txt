   In the future, all plant life on Earth is becoming extinct. As many
   specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of enormous,
   greenhouse-like geodesic domes, attached to large spaceships, one of
   which is named Valley Forge, forming part of a fleet of American
   Airlines space freighters, currently just outside the orbit of Saturn.

   Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist
   and ecologist who carefully maintains a variety of plants for their
   eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. Lowell
   spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and
   attending to the animal life.

   The crew receives orders to jettison and destroy the domes and return
   the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six domes are
   jettisoned and blown up, Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the
   plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crew-mates who
   arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is
   seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the
   destruction of one of the remaining domes, trapping and killing the
   remaining two crewmen.

   Enlisting the aid of the ship's three service robots, Lowell stages a
   fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the Valley Forge careening
   towards Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last
   forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his
   leg and sets the Valley Forge on a risky course through Saturn's rings.
   Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 is lost, but the
   ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other
   side of the rings. Lowell gives the surviving drones the names Dewey
   (Drone 1) and Huey (Drone 2), while the lost Drone 3 is named Louie.

   Lowell, Huey and Dewey set out into deep space to maintain the forest.
   Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. Lowell
   begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children.

   Huey is damaged when Lowell accidentally collides with him while
   driving a buggy recklessly, and Dewey sentimentally refuses to leave
   Huey's side during the repairs. As time passes, Lowell is horrified
   when he discovers that his bio-dome is dying, but is unable to come up
   with a solution to the problem. When the Berkshire - another space
   freighter waiting to see if the Valley Forge has survived the trip -
   eventually reestablishes contact, he knows that his crimes will soon be
   discovered. It is then that he realizes a lack of light has restricted
   plant growth, and he races to install lamps to correct this situation.
   In an effort to save the last forest before the Berkshire arrives,
   Lowell jettisons the dome to safety. He then detonates nuclear charges,
   destroying the Valley Forge, the damaged Huey and himself in the
   process. The final scene is of the now well-lit forest greenhouse
   drifting into deep space, with Dewey tenderly caring for it, holding a
   battered old watering can.
