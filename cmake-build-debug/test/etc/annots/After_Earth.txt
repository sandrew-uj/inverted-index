   In the future on a human-populated planet, Nova Prime, the S'krell
   alien race attempts to take it over with creatures called Ursas, which
   hunt by "sensing" fear. Peacekeeping organization The Ranger Corps
   defeat them with a fear-suppressing technique called "ghosting", but
   not before the Ursas kill Senshi, the daughter of the Rangers' leader
   Cypher Raige. Kitai, Cypher's son, blames himself for Senshi's death.
   He trains to become a Ranger like Cypher, but is rejected while
   applying. Kitai's mother Faia convinces Cypher to take Kitai on his
   last voyage before retirement. During flight, however, their spaceship
   is caught by an asteroid shower, causing them to crash-land on Earth,
   which the humans evacuated a thousand years ago due to an environmental
   cataclysm.

   Both of Cypher's legs are broken, and the main beacon for firing a
   distress signal is damaged. Cypher instructs Kitai to locate the tail
   section of the ship, which broke off on entry to the atmosphere. Inside
   is the backup beacon, which they can use to signal Nova Prime. Cypher
   gives Kitai his weapon, a wrist communicator and six capsules of a
   fluid that enhances the oxygen intake so he can breathe in Earth's
   low-oxygen atmosphere. Cypher warns him to avoid the highly evolved
   fauna and flora and be careful of violent thermal shifts. Kitai leaves
   to find the tail section, with Cypher guiding him through the
   communicator.

   Many hazards Cypher warned about get in Kitai's way, including attacks
   from monkeys and a venomous leech, a thermal shift, and the damaging of
   two of his capsules. After a story from Cypher about how he conceived
   "ghosting" to kill the Ursas, Kitai reaches a mountaintop and Cypher
   learns about the broken capsules. Knowing that the only way to make it
   with the two capsules would be to skydive, Cypher orders Kitai to abort
   the mission, but Kitai goes against the order after a monologue of him
   blaming Cypher's absence at home for Senshi's death. Kitai is captured
   by a large bird of prey and his communicator is damaged. Kitai, in the
   bird's nest, defends the chicks against big cats before escaping to a
   river, where he drifts on a raft. After a sleep where he dreams of
   Senshi, he wakes up to a thermal shift that nearly freezes him to
   death. Kitai is rescued when the bird, who had lost its brood when the
   cats attacked, sacrifices itself for him.

   Kitai reaches the tail section and retrieves the emergency beacon,
   which does not activate due to the atmosphere blocking the signal.
   Kitai learns that the ship's Ursa escaped and killed the rest of the
   crew. It attacks him, but Kitai is able to kill it through the "ghost"
   technique he learned from Cypher. Kitai uses a volcano to fire the
   beacon, and he and Cypher get back to Nova Prime via a rescue team.
