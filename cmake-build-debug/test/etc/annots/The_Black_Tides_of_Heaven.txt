   Sanao Hekate, The Protector, rules her empire with the help of Tensors,
   people who can control elemental forces known as the Slack. She opposes
   the development of technology for non-Tensor use and violently
   oppresses her populace at any hint of rebellion. As payment for the
   Grand Monastery's help in suppressing a rebellion, she sends her twin
   children Akeha and Mokoya to them.

   The children train their slackcraft with the monks of the monastery,
   becoming proficient in the usage of their powers. Mokoya begins to have
   dreams which prophesy future events, particularly events involving
   violence; any attempt to prevent these prophecies from occurring is
   impossible. Mokoya suffers psychologically from the effects of her
   nightmares, creating strain between the twins. When the twins are
   almost seventeen, they undergo gender confirmation. Children in the
   world of the Tensorate are raised without gender, and physical
   differences between the sexes are suppressed by slackcraft. Mokoya
   chooses to be confirmed as female, while Akeha chooses to be confirmed
   as male.

   Mokoya prophesies that a young man named Thennjay will become the next
   Head Abbot, despite the disapproval of the Protector. The Protector
   begins using Mokoya's powers to strengthen her rule but has no use for
   Akeha. Akeha flees the city and begins a career as a smuggler. Mokoya
   stays in the city, marries Thennjay, and has a daughter named Eien.

   Akeha falls in love with a man named Yeongchow, who is part of the
   Machinist rebellion. Machinists believe that all citizens should have
   access to technology. The Tensors and Machinists are developing modern
   technologies such as guns and bombs, increasing violent conflict
   throughout the empire. An accident in a research lab in the Grand
   Monastery kills Eien and severely injures Mokoya; the Protector uses
   this event as a pretense for an assault on the Monastery. Akeha returns
   to the capital to face his mother. He bests her in a fight but does not
   kill her, and she agrees to withdraw troops from the monastery. Mokoya
   recovers and reunites with her brother for the first time in years.
