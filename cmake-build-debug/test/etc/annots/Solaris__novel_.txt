   Solaris chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications
   with the extraterrestrial life inhabiting a distant alien planet named
   Solaris. The planet is almost completely covered with an ocean of gel
   that is revealed to be a single, planet-encompassing entity. Terran
   scientists conjecture it is a living and a sentient being, and attempt
   to communicate with it.

   Kris Kelvin, a psychologist, arrives aboard Solaris Station, a
   scientific research station hovering near the oceanic surface of
   Solaris. The scientists there have studied the planet and its ocean for
   many decades, mostly in vain. A scientific discipline known as
   Solaristics has degenerated over the years to simply observing,
   recording and categorizing the complex phenomena that occur upon the
   surface of the ocean. Thus far, the scientists have only compiled an
   elaborate nomenclature of the phenomena, and do not yet understand what
   such activities really mean. Shortly before Kelvin's arrival, the crew
   exposed the ocean to a more aggressive and unauthorized experimentation
   with a high-energy X-ray bombardment. Their experimentation gives
   unexpected results and becomes psychologically traumatic for them as
   individually flawed humans.

   The ocean's response to this intrusion exposes the deeper, hidden
   aspects of the personalities of the human scientists, while revealing
   nothing of the ocean's nature itself. It does this by materializing
   physical simulacra, including human ones; Kelvin confronts memories of
   his dead lover and guilt about her suicide. The "guests" of the other
   researchers are only alluded to. All human efforts to make sense of
   Solaris's activities prove futile. As Lem wrote, "The peculiarity of
   those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational
   activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the
   Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings."^[4] He also wrote
   that he deliberately chose to make the sentient alien an ocean to avoid
   any personification and the pitfalls of anthropomorphism in depicting
   first contact.^[3]
