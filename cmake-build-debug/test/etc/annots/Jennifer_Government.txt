   John Nike, Vice President of Guerrilla Marketing, contracts Hack Nike,
   a clumsy and naive low-level-employee, to execute an ambitious and
   unethical secret marketing scheme. John plans to increase interest in
   the upcoming Nike Mercury shoes by having Hack kill people who try to
   buy them, intending to make the shoes appear so desirable that
   customers are killing each other to acquire them. Hack signs the
   contract without reading it. When he finds out that it requires him to
   commit murder, he subcontracts the scheme to the Police, now a
   mercenary organisation, in an attempt to keep his job (which requires
   fulfilling the contract) without having to take responsibility for
   murder.

   After several children are murdered at various Nike stores on opening
   day, Jennifer Government takes it upon herself to track down the
   perpetrators, even if she cannot get the funding for her investigation.
   One of the murdered children bought the shoes with money given to her
   by Buy Mitsui, a French stockbroker flush with money after recent
   professional success. Feeling personally responsible for the girl's
   death, Buy joins forces with Jennifer.

   At the same time, Violet (Hack's girlfriend) creates a dangerous
   computer virus, intending to sell it to the highest bidder. She
   succeeds in selling it to ExxonMobil. Her handlers take her all over
   the world to exploit the virus's power, but never pay her for it.
   Angered, Violet turns to John Nike, who promises to help her revenge
   herself on ExxonMobil. In exchange, John demands that Violet kidnap
   Kate, Jennifer Government's daughter, intending to use her as leverage
   to deter Jennifer's investigation.

   Hack Nike is fired and founds an anti-corporate activist group in order
   to take revenge on John Nike. Hack and Jennifer Government succeed in
   rescuing Kate and arresting John.
