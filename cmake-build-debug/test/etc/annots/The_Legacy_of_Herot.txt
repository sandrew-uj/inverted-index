   Two hundred colonists arrive on Avalon, having made the 100-year
   journey from Earth in suspended animation on the starship Geographic.
   The colonists, selected for their outstanding physical and mental
   acuity, make a terrible discovery: the suspended animation has damaged
   their intellect and reasoning skills. Some are only mildly afflicted,
   while others have serious intellectual disabilities; eight cannot be
   reanimated at all.

   The colonists build a settlement on an isolated island, and begin
   growing crops and stocking the nearby waters with terrestrial species
   to complement the samlon, a local aquatic species. The colonists become
   overconfident in their security, to the frustration of expedition
   security officer (and former soldier) Cadmann Weyland. When unsettling
   events begin to happen - missing animals, fences torn down - the
   colonists' impaired minds prevent them from properly analyzing the
   situation. Weyland is suspected of sabotage to further his agenda of
   building up defenses. He is drugged and restrained when a monster
   attacks the settlement, killing ten colonists.

   Resenting his treatment, Weyland retreats from the colony to an
   isolated homestead on a mountain near the colony. Mary Ann, a colonist
   with a romantic interest in Weyland, convinces him to allow her to stay
   with him, and conceives his child. Ultimately, Weyland agrees to assist
   the colony in its defenses.

   The colonists are confounded by the ecology of the island, as there
   does not seem to be a sufficient food source for the creatures to
   inhabit it. An autopsy reveals that grendels (as the creatures are now
   known, in reference to Beowulf) are crocodilian in appearance and
   behavior, with powerful jaws and claws, and a sense of smell better
   than a dog's. Its brain shows it is at least as intelligent as a
   gorilla. It possesses a snorkel enabling it to lurk under several feet
   of water. Its cardiovascular system and musculature give it strength
   and stamina far beyond that of humans. A grendel can release a
   super-oxygenated blood supplement into its blood that does to it what
   nitrous oxide does to internal combustion engines - enable short bursts
   of speed in excess of 100 miles per hour. This trait makes the grendels
   devastating, but is also the key to their destruction. Using the
   supercharger causes the grendels to heat up so rapidly that they die if
   they do not immediately return to water to cool off. With this
   knowledge and their technology and tactics, the colonists are able to
   wipe out the grendel population of the island within several months,
   making Weyland a hero to the people who previously turned on him.

   Some months later, the colony's scientists come to a disturbing
   realization: the grendels and the aquatic samlon are the same species.
   Their life cycle is similar to that of terrestrial frogs - the
   herbivorous samlon are in fact the juvenile form of the carnivorous
   grendels. The juvenile samlon are male, and become female when they
   mature. Interaction is unnecessary, as the grendels continually lay
   unfertilized eggs in the water for the samlon to fertilize. Like some
   species of frogs, the grendels are cannibalistic - if no other prey is
   present, they will eat their own young. On the colony's island, all
   other prey sources were previously exhausted, and the grendels have
   turned to cannibalism as the rule rather than the exception. The
   colonists have exterminated the adult grendels. But as there is now no
   check at all on the samlon population, they all become grendels,
   meaning that instead of a few dozen grendels, there are now thousands.

   Weyland again asserts control. The colony's pregnant women, children
   and essential specialists are evacuated to the Geographic. The grendels
   cannot hunt far from water, so most others are evacuated to Weyland's
   mountain camp. Combat is joined. At first, the colonists' technology
   and tactics serve them well. Weyland observes the grendels' behavior
   and discovers that packs of grendels can be sent into a shark-like
   feeding frenzy by spraying them with blood taken from dead grendels,
   especially if it is laced with the "supercharger" chemical. Tracer
   bullets are used to ignite the supercharger gland in their bodies.

   But as the grendels' numbers fall, their individual strength rises, as
   every dead grendel is food for the rest. Eventually, all that remain
   are the strongest and fastest fully grown grendels, and the colonists
   make a planned retreat to Weyland's mountain retreat. As the horde
   approaches, the colonists spray them with more supercharger, sending
   them into a frenzy once more. When they begin climbing the bluff,
   Weyland sets off a deadfall trap, killing even more. The grendels,
   though not as smart as humans, are smart enough to learn, given time
   and much experience. Their behavior changes as they realize the
   remaining colonists are not worth dying to reach when there are other
   grendels to kill. The colony is saved.

   One year later, the grendels are being driven to extinction. Now that
   the grendel life cycle is known, the colonists continue the hunts, but
   this time the samlon are targeted as well. The new tactics,
   supercharger spraying and recorded grendel challenges, make them almost
   a routine chore. The terrestrial fish are gone, and will not be
   reintroduced, forcing the grendels to help drive their own species to
   extinction through cannibalism. Now rebuilding can begin. The battle
   against the grendels has left the colony with surplus of women, and a
   new social organization based on polygamous marriage is taking shape.
   The mainland is being explored, and the colonists have high hopes. The
   colonists hope the story of their battle will inspire Earth's
   population to restart its nascent colonization program.
