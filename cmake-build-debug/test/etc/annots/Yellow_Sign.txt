   The first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:
     * A play in book form entitled The King in Yellow
     * A mysterious and malevolent supernatural and gothic entity known as
       the King in Yellow
     * An eerie symbol called the Yellow Sign

   These stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other
   tales, on characters who are often artists or decadents, inhabitants of
   the demi-monde.

   The first and fourth stories, "The Repairer of Reputations" and "The
   Yellow Sign", are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the
   second and third stories, "The Mask" and "In the Court of the Dragon",
   are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme: "Have you
   found the Yellow Sign?"

   The macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining
   stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style
   common to Chambers' later work. They are all linked to the preceding
   stories by their Parisian setting and their artistic protagonists.
