   When You Reach Me takes place during the 1978-1979 school year of
   Miranda, the main character. Stead placed Miranda's home in the Upper
   West Side, New York City, where Stead grew up. Many parts of the novel
   explore "the same streets where Stead grew up, and riffs on some of her
   experiences". Stead was inspired to use this setting because she
   moved into an apartment near her childhood home early in the
   development of the story. There she had experienced her first
   independence while exploring the streets, only to find a scary man near
   her house. Wondering why he was there, Stead later used this encounter
   as "the anchor as she wrote When You Reach Me".
