   Endymion is the third science fiction novel by American writer Dan
   Simmons, first published in 1996. Part of his Hyperion Cantos fictional
   universe, it centers on the new characters Aenea and Raul Endymion, and
   was well received, like its predecessors Hyperion and The Fall of
   Hyperion. Within a year of its release, the paperback edition had gone
   through five reprints. The novel was shortlisted for the 1997 Locus
   Award.
