   Moonheart is an urban fantasy novel by Charles de Lint. It takes place
   in 1980s Ottawa, where Sara Kendell and Jamie Tamson, owners of an
   antique store, come into possession of a peculiar ring. At the same
   time Kieran Foy, a wizard of sorts, is searching for his missing
   mentor, Thomas Hengwr, while simultaneously eluding the newly formed
   Project Mindreach from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When Sara and
   Kieran run into each other and end up in "the other world", they find
   that there is much more to Sara and to Tamson House (Sara and Jamie's
   house the size of a city block) than previously known. But when an
   ancient evil resurfaces and threatens to destroy both worlds (and all
   the people within), the officers, wizards, and Tamson House residents
   have to learn to work together to destroy the monster.
