   Alan Desland is a socially awkward Englishman who makes a living as a
   collector and dealer of fine pottery including antique ceramics. On a
   business trip to Copenhagen, he falls headlong in love with a
   mysterious and beautiful young woman named Kaethe (or in later
   editions, Karin), who does clerical work for him and one of his
   colleagues. After ten days of mutually infatuated courtship, he
   proposes marriage to her despite knowing nothing about her family or
   background. At one stage Alan glimpses her from afar with the figure of
   a girl who Kaethe later tells him was the daughter of a friend. She
   accepts Alan's proposal on the condition that their wedding should take
   place as a civil ceremony in England, and appears to have no interest
   in inviting any relatives or friends of her own from Europe.

   In the event, their marriage and honeymoon end up taking place near
   Gainesville, Florida, in the United States, thanks to the intervention
   of an American acquaintance. While swimming in a river together with
   Alan, Kaethe is frightened by what seems to her the figure of a drowned
   girl, though Alan reassures her that it is only a log. Her playful
   sensuality overwhelms Alan, continuing to captivate him and their
   entire social circle after their return home to run his family's
   ceramics shop. Kaethe discovers, at an auction, a valuable ceramic
   figurine of "The Girl in a Swing" - one of only three known such
   figurines - which promises to bring wealth to the couple. In a haunting
   episode in which Alan may or may not be in trance, he arrives home to
   find Kaethe naked on the swing in the yard of their property, and as
   they make love on the lawn, undergoes a transcendent experience.

   Alan's psychic senses (mostly latent since adolescence) begin to warn
   him that something has gone wrong. Troubling occurrences (including the
   sounds of water in the night, the sounds of a crying child in the
   garden, and the hinted supernatural nature of a large black Alsatian
   dog) contribute to Alan's sense of a fated outcome to Kaethe's fears of
   some impending doom. Kaethe, who has announced she may be pregnant,
   seeks succour from her unspecified anxieties by accompanying Alan to
   the communion service at church, but is unable to swallow the communion
   wafer and faints when about to drink the communion wine. Gradually the
   horror grows until after one haunted night, the couple flee their home.

   Alan eventually learns that, unbeknown to him, Kaethe had had a
   daughter when they met; out of fear that Alan would reject her (Kaethe)
   if he learned of the daughter, Kaethe had killed her daughter. In the
   end, Kaethe dies of an ectopic pregnancy.
