   The central theme of the novel is time travel using a highway that
   links all times and all possible histories.^[2] Exits from the highway
   lead to different times and places. Changing events in the past cause
   some exits further up the road, in the future, to become overgrown and
   inaccessible and new exits to appear, leading to different alternative
   futures.

   The narrator and protagonist, Red Dorakeen, has vague memories of a
   place or time that is no longer accessible from the Road. He runs guns
   to the Greeks at Marathon, trying to recreate history as he remembers
   it in an attempt to open a new exit from the Road to his
   half-remembered place. The phrase "Last Exit to Babylon" was the
   manuscript title of the book and appears on the cover art; it was later
   used as a title for Volume Four in the Collected Stories of Roger
   Zelazny.^[3]

   All "One" chapters feature Red Dorakeen, and all "Two" chapters feature
   secondary characters. These are Red's natural son Randy, newly
   introduced to the Road and tired of his old life in Ohio; a series of
   potential assassins attempting to kill Red, some of whom are comic
   references to pulp characters or real people; and Leila, a woman whose
   destiny is closely connected to Red's.

   The "One" storyline is fairly linear, but the "Two" storyline jumps
   around in time and sequence, first introducing Randy and Leila without
   introduction, then later showing Randy's introduction to the Road and
   meeting with Leila, who will/has just abandoned Red following an
   incident in the "One" timeline. The narrative becomes clear in the
   final chapter.
