   It has been a year since the events in Lucky Starr and the Oceans of
   Venus, and in that time a government-funded research project, Project
   Light, is built at the astronomical observatory on Mercury's north pole
   to conduct research into the newly discovered sub-etheric optics in
   hope of transmitting solar energy through hyperspace. The head of
   Project Light is the leading scientist in sub-etheric optics, Scott
   Mindes. A series of accidents has plagued Project Light, which David
   "Lucky" Starr and John Bigman Jones have come to investigate. Shortly
   after meeting Starr and Bigman, Mindes takes them onto the surface of
   Mercury and explains his worries; but works himself into a frenzy and
   fires a blaster at Starr, whereupon Bigman tackles him and he is
   brought unconscious into the observatory.

   Starr and Bigman meet Mindes' friend Dr. Karl Gardoma, the
   observatory's physician; Jonathan Urteil, who works for a political
   opponent of the Council of Science named Senator Swenson; Dr. Lance
   Peverale, the head of the observatory; and Dr. Hanley Cook, Pevarale's
   chief assistant, who wants to succeed Peverale. The next day, at a
   banquet in Starr's honor, Peverale states his belief that the Sirians
   are behind the troubles plaguing Project Light; whereupon Starr replies
   that the Sirians' most likely locations are the abandoned mines located
   beneath the observatory, and proposes to search them.

   Speaking to Cook after dinner, Starr learns Cook's opinion Peverale has
   become obsessed thinking of the Sirian threat. While Bigman prepares
   for the trip into the mines, Starr obtains two micro-ergometers,
   whereby to detect atomic power sources at a distance. In the mines,
   Starr tells Bigman that his suggestion of Sirians in the mines was a
   ruse, and that he intends to investigate the sunside while Bigman
   remains in the mines and maintains the pretense of Starr's presence
   there. After Starr leaves, Bigman is attacked by Urteil, and both are
   attacked by a heat-seeking native organism. Bigman distracts the latter
   with Urteil's blaster, then calls the Dome for help. On the sunside,
   Starr finds the source of the sabotage in a Sirian robot, driven by
   solar radiation to forego the Three Laws of Robotics, so that it
   attacks him before he can question it.

   In the Dome, Bigman challenges Urteil to a fight in Mercurian gravity.
   Dr. Cook reduces the artificial gravity in the Dome's power room to
   Mercurian levels to accommodate them; but during the fight, the gravity
   suddenly returns to Earth-normal, and Urteil dies in a fall.

   When Starr returns to the dome and learns of Urteil's death, he asks to
   be present when Peverale conducts an official inquiry, at which Bigman
   reveals that it was Cook who caused Urteil's death and reveals that
   only Cook knew where he and Starr would be in the mines, wherefore
   Urteil must have gotten the information from him. Cook then admits that
   Urteil had blackmailed him, and was killed to save Cook's career. Starr
   then reveals that the robot was brought from Sirius by Peverale in hope
   to use it to implicate the Sirians in the sabotage of Project Light.
   Starr has Peverale and Cook placed under arrest, and assumes control of
   the Dome in the name of the Council of Science.

   On the return journey to Earth, Starr admits to Bigman that the present
   quarrel between Senator Swenson and the Council of Science was a draw,
   in that Jonathan Urteil was not able to manufacture any scandal against
   Project Light, but the two top men at the Mercury observatory were
   exposed as felons. Although Swenson is ruthless and dangerous, he is
   the sort of critic the council needs to keep it honest.
