   Alternate Realities is a 2000 omnibus collection of three short science
   fiction novels by American writer author C. J. Cherryh: Wave Without a
   Shore (1981), Port Eternity (1982), and Voyager in Night (1984). All
   three novels are set in Cherryh's Alliance-Union universe and share a
   common theme of people encountering and coping with a reality different
   from their own.

   The original books as well as the omnibus edition were all published by
   DAW Books. The novels are what Cherryh and her publisher at DAW, Donald
   A. Wollheim, referred to as "magic cookie" books. Such works explore
   unusual themes and ideas in science fiction, and can in some sense be
   seen as thought experiments. Wollheim encouraged Cherryh to experiment
   in this way during the late 1970s and early 1980s because he felt that
   the science fiction market would support such unusual offerings at the
   time.^[1]

   One consequence of this approach is that the original novels were
   therefore short by contemporary standards, each having only
   approximately 90,000 words. The relative brevity of the books
   facilitated DAW's release of the omnibus edition in 2000.
