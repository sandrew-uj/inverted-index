   Yet moments before death, someone mysteriously appeared and said, 'Take
   my hand ...'
   But Liam, Maddy and Sal aren't rescued. They are recruited by an agency
   that no one knows exists, with only one purpose--to fix broken history.
   Because time travel is here, and there are those who would go back in
   time and change the past. That's why the TimeRiders exist: to protect
   us. To stop time travel from destroying the world...

   The TimeRiders series' summary

   The novels revolve around three teens who are recruited by an agency
   known as 'The Agency' just before their deaths. The Agency was set up
   by Roald Waldstein to protect the established set of events throughout
   history and to fix it if it is tampered with. They operate from their
   field office underneath an archway of the Williamsburg Bridge in New
   York City in a two-day 'Time Bubble', on September 10 and 11, 2001.
   Each novel revolves around a major change in the historical timeline
   and the team must work with each other to fix it with the help of their
   'support units' - cyborgs who can mimic human behaviour. Later in the
   series the characters move to a second base under the Holborn Viaduct
   in Victorian London.
