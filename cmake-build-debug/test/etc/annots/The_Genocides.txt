   The Genocides describes the genocide of humans by aliens who seed Earth
   with enormous Plants. The Plants are massive and rapidly out-compete
   terrestrial flora, forming a monoculture. They appear unwholesome to
   the native fauna, and the extinction of all Earthly life seems
   inevitable.

   The novel opens with a small rural community struggling for survival on
   the border of Lake Superior, a few years after the coming of the Plants
   and the collapse of civilization. The community, led by Anderson and
   his family, eke out an existence by siphoning sap from the Plants to
   irrigate their corn crop. Anderson is a conservative and religious man,
   harsh and uncompromising, but he has managed to keep his people alive
   and focused on survival. His rules include hostility to outsiders, who
   are routinely killed unless they are of use to the community.

   Elsewhere, a group of vagrants encounter spherical machines that are
   incinerating every trace of humanity left on Earth. Fleeing the
   machines, the group runs afoul of Anderson's community, who kill all
   but two of their number: Jeremiah Orville, a mining engineer, and Alice
   Nemerov, a nurse. The novel implies that the dead are ground into
   sausage meat and consumed. Jeremiah assimilates into the community, but
   secretly plots revenge on Anderson and his family. In the process, he
   courts Anderson's thirteen-year-old daughter, Blossom, and befriends
   Anderson's educated son, Buddy.

   During the harsh winter, the spherical machines arrive to incinerate
   the community, and Jeremiah sees his revenge coming to fruition. Most
   of the community is slaughtered by the machines, and the few who
   survive the initial conflagration flee into a cave. There, they
   discover the Plants' roots are hollow and form a massive and
   interlocking underground network. Jeremiah suggests they go deeper,
   pointing out that they will be able to escape the winter (and the
   machines) underground.

   Deep underground, they discover the "fruit" of the plants is housed in
   the root system: a nutritious pulp that sustains the community for
   weeks. Anderson, who lost his wife Lady when fleeing, becomes upset by
   the increasing indolence of his people, as his harsh rules are no
   longer required for survival. When he is bitten by a rat, gangrene sets
   in and he declines quickly. Anderson's final words to his brutish son,
   Neil, are to let Jeremiah take over as leader and to allow Jeremiah to
   marry Blossom. This decision angers Neil, and he murders Anderson, as
   well as Alice when she discovers evidence of his act. Neil then assumes
   leadership, but proves too unintelligent to manage the group, and the
   community breaks up.

   In the aftermath, Jeremiah goes in search of Blossom, planning to kill
   her and complete his revenge, but when he finds her, he experiences a
   change of heart and falls in love. They decide to return to the others,
   but discover Neil has sabotaged their escape - and, inadvertently, his
   own. Neil, Jeremiah, Blossom, and Buddy try to find their way back
   together, but the Plants' tunnel network suddenly floods with sap, and
   they become lost and exhausted. Neil turns against the group, but is
   overcome and abandoned in the dark.

   When the three survivors finally return to the diminished group, they
   find machines have come to harvest the Plants' crop. Without the pulp
   to live on, the group returns to the surface, where they discover that
   a new crop of Plants has been sown by the mysterious aliens. The
   malnourished group has no chance of survival, and the novel closes on
   Jeremiah and Blossom leaving them to travel into the wilderness. The
   pair, starving and mismatched in age, are portrayed as a distorted
   mirror image of the biblical Adam and Eve and herald the end of
   humanity instead of the beginning.
