   Rite of Passage is told as a flashback by Mia Havero, the daughter of
   the Chairman of the Ship's Council, after she has completed her own
   rite of passage, also known as Trial. She has survived for thirty days
   on a colony planet with minimal supplies as part of her initiation into
   adulthood on one of several giant Ships that survived Earth's
   destruction in AD 2041. To prevent overpopulation on the Ships, family
   units can only produce children with the approval of the Ship's
   Eugenics Council. The penalty for breaking this rule is exile to a
   colony world.

   By the year 2198, Mia Havero is twelve years old and, like most of
   Ship-bound humanity, regards the colonists as "Mudeaters", a derogatory
   reference to frontier life on a planet. When she accompanies her father
   on a trading mission to the planet Grainau, Mia learns from the
   children of a Grainau official that the feeling is mutual; many on the
   colony worlds call Ship people "Grabbies" because they take whatever
   goods they cannot produce on the Ships in return for knowledge and
   technology (doled out sparingly), the heritage of Earth to which the
   ship residents have laid claim and which colonists are unable to
   maintain, being too busy staying alive.

   When Mia returns to the Ship, in addition to her regular studies, she
   joins a survival class. Survival class is every thirteen-year-old's
   preparation for Trial, the Ships' rite of passage into adulthood
   required within three months of turning fourteen. By requiring
   adolescents to experience the rigors and dangers of life on a colony
   planet, the Ships hope to avoid stagnation and ensure that those who
   survive are skilled enough to contribute significantly to Ship life.
   However, the mortality rate of Trial participants is fairly high, so no
   expense is spared to train the adolescents about to go through Trial so
   that they will survive the month spent planetside.

   Mia's companion in school and in survival class is Jimmy Dentremont, a
   highly gifted boy of her own age. Their initial rivalry turns to
   friendship and eventually blossoms into love. Both in and out of
   survival class, sometimes with Jimmy and sometimes with other children,
   Mia has a series of adventures that build her confidence, broaden her
   world, and prepare her for Trial. Her moral awareness also grows during
   this time, both through formal study of ethical theory and through
   reflection on the errors she inevitably makes as she risks new
   experiences.

   Shortly after her fourteenth birthday, Mia and her class are dispatched
   to the planet Tintera to undergo their Trial. Having quarreled with
   Jimmy, Mia refuses to team with him, but still chooses the tiger
   strategy over the turtle strategy; that is, she chooses to act on this
   world rather than hide out for the month that she's on planet. Mia soon
   encounters a party of rough men on horseback, who are herding Losels,
   native humanoids the Tinterans treat as domestic animals and use for
   simple labor, although they may be intelligent enough to be considered
   slaves. Mia escapes the Losel herders' attempted kidnapping, and when
   she reaches the nearest town, she is repulsed by the fact that all
   Tinterans are "Free Birthers"--they have no population control. She is
   also disturbed by their apparent practice of enslaving Losels.

   After a second run-in with the Losel herders leaves Mia badly beaten
   and robbed of the signalling device she will need to return to her
   Ship, she is rescued by Daniel Kutsov, an old man who has been reduced
   to a simple, manual job as a result of past political activity. Kutsov
   treats Mia like an adopted grandchild and explains to Mia that her
   speech gives her away as being from the Ships. Kutsov tells Mia that
   Ship people are at best regarded with resentment, and at worst killed.
   Mia has already learned that the Tinterans have captured a scoutship
   from another Ship and arrested one of her fellow Trial participants.
   While recovering from her injuries in Kutsov's house, she discovers
   that the prisoner is Jimmy Dentremont. Singlehanded, Mia stages a
   jailbreak and escapes to the wilderness with Jimmy, but not before the
   two witness the brutal killing of Kutsov in a roundup of political
   dissidents.

   Riding through the night in the pouring rain, Mia and Jimmy set up a
   tent in the woods. While in the tent, they realize their feelings for
   each other and have sex. They arrive the following day at the military
   headquarters for the territory, where Jimmy retrieves his own
   signalling device. Before they leave the base, they also disable the
   captured scoutship.

   Soon after Mia and Jimmy return from Trial, a Shipwide Assembly debates
   what to do about Tintera. The Tinterans are Free Birthers, possibly
   slavers, and a potential danger to the Ship itself. As Mia hears the
   Assembly's debate, however, she understands that her views have
   changed. Her moral world has broadened to include the Tinterans as
   people, rather than faceless spear carriers to be used and discarded.
   Thus she cannot bring herself to condemn the Tinterans en masse.
   However, under the leadership of Mia's father, who perceives the
   Tinterans as beyond re-education, the Assembly votes by an
   eight-to-five margin to destroy Tintera in the name of 'moral
   discipline'. Mia and Jimmy, as adults, prepare to settle into their own
   living quarters on board Ship. Jimmy offers the hope that they will
   someday be in a position to change their society.
