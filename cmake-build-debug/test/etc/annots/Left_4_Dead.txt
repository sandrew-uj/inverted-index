   An outbreak of a highly contagious pathogen nicknamed the "Green Flu"
   (which causes extreme aggression, mutation to the body cells, loss of
   higher brain functions, and essential zombification of those who catch
   it) begins in Pennsylvania. Memorial walls--giving names &
   obituaries to those who have died in the infection--suggest that the
   game takes place in October 2009. Two weeks after the first
   infection, four immune survivors--Green Beret and Vietnam veteran
   William "Bill" Overbeck (voiced by Jim French), college student Zoey
   (voiced by Jen Taylor), district account manager Louis (voiced by Earl
   Alexander), and outlaw biker Francis (voiced by Vince Valenzuela)--make
   their way out of the city of Fairfield, only to discover that the
   infection is creating dangerous mutations in some of its hosts.

   After narrowly avoiding the new types of infected, the survivors are
   alerted by a passing helicopter to an evacuation point at the roof of
   Mercy Hospital. Fighting their way through the city's streets, subway,
   and sewers, they are rescued from the hospital's roof by the pilot,
   only to discover that he is infected. Zoey is forced to kill him,
   causing the helicopter to crash in an industrial district outside the
   city. Finding an armored delivery truck, the group uses it to reach the
   small town of Riverside. After encountering a hostile and delirious man
   in the local church, they discover that the town is overrun and head to
   a boathouse for rescue. Contacting a small fishing vessel, they are
   dropped at the city of Newburg across the river, finding much of it in
   flames. Resting in a greenhouse, the survivors are interrupted by a
   military C-130 Hercules passing overhead, leading them to believe that
   it will land at the city's airport. The U.S. military had bombed the
   airport in an attempt to contain the infection, though the runway is
   partially intact, allowing the survivors to fuel up and escape in the
   waiting C-130.

   Like the helicopter before it, this plane also crashes, and the
   survivors find themselves at the outskirts of the Allegheny National
   Forest. Following a series of train tracks, the group finally reaches a
   functioning but abandoned military outpost. After answering a radio
   transmission, they make their final stand against hordes of infected
   before a military APC arrives to supposedly transport them to Northeast
   Safe Zone Echo, one of the few remaining safe areas. Instead, they are
   detained in a military installation, where they learn that they are
   not immune and are actually asymptomatic carriers who have infected
   most of their rescuers. Meanwhile, the base is overthrown by a mutiny,
   attracting hordes of infected. The survivors escape via train and
   travel south at the insistence of Bill, who believes they can find
   long-term safety on the islands of the Florida Keys.

   At the portside town of Rayford in Georgia, they find a sailboat but
   must first raise a lift bridge powered by an aging generator to reach
   open waters. As the bridge raises, the generator gives out. Bill
   sacrifices himself to restart it so that the others may reach safety.
   While waiting for the horde to disperse, the three remaining members
   encounter four more survivors. They agree to move the boat to the other
   side of the bridge, and help the other survivors re-lower the bridge so
   that they can cross in their car. Louis, Zoey, and Francis then return
   to their boat and set a course for the Florida Keys.
