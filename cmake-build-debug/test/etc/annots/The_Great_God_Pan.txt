   Clarke agrees, somewhat unwillingly, to bear witness to a strange
   experiment performed by his friend, Dr. Raymond. The ultimate goal of
   the doctor is to open the mind of a patient so that they may experience
   the spiritual world, an experience he notes the ancients called "seeing
   the great god Pan". He performs the experiment, which involves minor
   brain surgery, on a young woman named Mary. She awakens from the
   operation awed and terrified but quickly becomes "a hopeless idiot".

   Years later, Clarke learns of a beautiful but sinister girl named Helen
   Vaughan, who is reported to have caused a series of mysterious
   happenings in her town. She spends much of her time in the woods near
   her house, and takes other children on prolonged twilight rambles in
   the countryside that disturb the parents of the town. One day, a young
   boy stumbles across her "playing on the grass with a 'strange naked
   man,'"; the boy becomes hysterical and later, after seeing a Roman
   statue of a satyr's head, becomes permanently feeble-minded. Helen also
   forms an unusually close friendship with a neighbour girl, Rachel, whom
   she leads several times into the woods. On one occasion Rachel returns
   home distraught, half-naked and rambling. Shortly after explaining to
   her mother what happened to her (never revealed in the story), Rachel
   returns to the woods and disappears forever. Clarke relates these
   events in a book he is writing entitled Memoirs to Prove the Existence
   of the Devil.

   Years later, Villiers happens across his old friend Herbert, who has
   become a vagrant since they last met. When asked how he has fallen so
   low, Herbert replies that he has been "corrupted body and soul" by his
   wife. After some investigation with Clarke and another character,
   Austin, it is revealed that Helen was Herbert's wife, and that a
   well-to-do man died "of fright, of sheer, awful terror" after seeing
   something in Herbert and Helen's home. Herbert is later found dead.

   Helen disappears for some time; according to rumor, she spent the time
   taking part in disturbing orgies somewhere in the Americas. She
   eventually returns to London under the pseudonym Mrs. Beaumont. Soon
   after, a group of stable, happy men in London commit suicide; the last
   person known to have been in the presence of each of them was Mrs.
   Beaumont, whom they are implied to have slept with. Villiers and
   Clarke, each learning of Mrs. Beaumont's true identity, band together
   and confront Helen in her house with a noose. They tell her that she
   must kill herself, or they will expose her. Helen has a very abnormal
   death, transforming between human and beast, male and female, and
   dividing and reuniting, before turning into a jelly-like substance and
   finally dying.

   This is followed by a fragment of a document about the remains of a
   pillar honoring the Celtic god Nodens. The Latin inscription on the
   column reads, "To the great god Nodens (the god of the Great Deep or
   Abyss), Flavius Senilis has erected this pillar on account of the
   marriage which he saw beneath the shade." The document says that
   historians are puzzled as to what the inscription refers to. The
   novella ends with a fragment of a letter from Dr. Raymond to Clarke,
   which reveals that Helen was the child of Mary, who died shortly after
   her daughter's birth. In the letter, Raymond informs Clarke that Mary
   became pregnant after his experiment caused her to see the god Pan,
   implying that Pan fathered Helen.
