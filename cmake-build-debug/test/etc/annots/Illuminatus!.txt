   The trilogy's story begins with an investigation by two New York City
   police detectives (Saul Goodman and Barney Muldoon) into the bombing of
   Confrontation, a leftist magazine, and the disappearance of its editor,
   Joe Malik. Discovering the magazine's investigation into the
   assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther
   King Jr., the two follow a trail of memos that suggest the involvement
   of powerful secret societies. They slowly become drawn into a web of
   conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, the magazine's reporter, George
   Dorn--having been turned loose without support deep in right-wing Mad
   Dog, Texas--is arrested for drug possession. He is jailed and
   physically threatened, at one point hallucinating about his own
   execution. The prison is bombed and he is rescued by the Discordians,
   led by the enigmatic Hagbard Celine, captain of a golden submarine.
   Hagbard represents the Discordians in their eternal battle against the
   Illuminati, the conspiratorial organization that secretly controls the
   world. He finances his operations by smuggling illicit substances.

   The plot meanders around the globe to such locations as Las Vegas
   (where a potentially deadly, secret U.S. government-developed mutated
   anthrax epidemic has been accidentally unleashed); Atlantis (where
   Howard, the talking porpoise, and his porpoise aides help Hagbard
   battle the Illuminati); Chicago (where someone resembling John
   Dillinger was killed many years ago); and to the island of Fernando Poo
   (the location of the next great Cold War standoff between the Soviet
   Union, China and the United States).

   The evil scheme uncovered late in the tale is an attempt to immanentize
   the eschaton, a secret scheme of the American Medical Association, an
   evil rock band, to bring about a mass human sacrifice, the purpose of
   which is the release of enough "life-energy" to give eternal life to a
   select group of initiates, including Adolf Hitler. The AMA are revealed
   to be four siblings (last name Saure) who comprise four of the five
   mysterious Illuminati Primi. The identity of the fifth remains unknown
   for much of the trilogy. The first European "Woodstock" festival, held
   at Ingolstadt, Bavaria (place of origin of the real historical
   Illuminati, also known as Bavarian Illuminati), is the chosen location
   for the sacrifice of the unwary victims, via the reawakening of
   hibernating Nazi battalions from the bottom of nearby (fictitious) Lake
   Totenkopf (literal translation to contemporary American styled English-
   "dead head"). The plot is foiled when, with the help of a 50-foot-tall
   incarnation of the goddess Eris, the four members of the AMA are
   killed: Wilhelm is killed by the monstrous alien being Yog-Sothoth,
   Wolfgang is shot by John Dillinger, Winifred is drowned by porpoises,
   and Werner is trapped in a sinking car.

   The major protagonists, now gathered together on board the submarine,
   are menaced by the Leviathan, a giant, pyramid-shaped single-cell sea
   monster that has been growing in size for hundreds of millions of
   years. The over-the-top nature of this encounter leads some of the
   characters to question whether they are merely characters in a book.
   This metafictional note is swiftly rejected (or ignored) as they turn
   their attention to the monster again. The threat is neutralized by
   offering up their onboard computer as something for the creature to
   communicate with to ease its loneliness. Finally Hagbard managed to
   defeat the Illuminati Primi and went to Alpha Centauri in 1999.
