   In 2050, sometime after a nuclear war, Danielle (Melanie Kilgour)
   searches for her missing sister in New Idaho. All cities have been
   destroyed and humanity lives in small groups in the countryside. The
   Warriors, a government sanctioned paramilitary group, have kidnapped
   the healthy sister in an attempt to harvest her healthy blood. The
   leader of the warriors (Frank Wilson) is insane. Orion (Thom Kilgour)
   assists Danielle.

   Danielle rescues loner Lucas (William Smith), who later returns the
   favor and assists her in assembling a group for her sister's rescue.
