   The narrative voice for the novel alternates between the third person
   and the first person, the latter in the form of a diary kept by Dr.
   Theodore "Theo" Faron, an Oxford don.

   The novel opens with the first entry in Theo's diary. It is the year
   2021, but the novel's events have their origin in 1995, which is
   referred to as "Year Omega". In 1994, the sperm count of human males
   plummeted to zero, a feminist civil war broke out, and mankind now
   faces imminent extinction. The last people to be born are now called
   "Omegas". "A race apart", they enjoy various prerogatives. Theo writes
   that the last human being to be born on Earth has been killed in a pub
   brawl.

   In 2006, Xan Lyppiatt, Theo's rich and charismatic cousin, appointed
   himself Warden of England in the last general election. As people have
   lost all interest in politics, Lyppiatt abolishes democracy. He is
   called a despot and tyrant by his opponents, but officially the new
   society is referred to as egalitarian.

   Theo is approached by a woman called Julian, a member of a group of
   dissidents calling themselves the Five Fishes. He meets with them at an
   isolated church. Rolf, their leader and Julian's husband, is hostile,
   but the others--Miriam (a former midwife), Gascoigne (a man from a
   military family), Luke (a former priest), and Julian--are more
   personable. The group wants Theo to approach Xan on their behalf and
   ask for various reforms, including a return to a more democratic
   system. During their discussions, as Theo prepares to meet with Xan,
   the reader learns how the UK is in 2021:
     * The Omegas are described as spoiled, over-entitled and egotistical
       because of their youth and luxurious lifestyle. They are violent,
       remote, and unstable. They regard non-Omegas (elders) with
       undisguised contempt, yet they are spared punishment due to their
       age. According to rumour, outside of the UK, some countries
       sacrifice Omegas in fertility rituals.
     * Due to the global infertility of mankind, newborn animals (such as
       kittens and puppies) are doted upon and treated as infants, pushed
       in prams, and dressed in children's clothing. The latest trend in
       London is to have elaborate christening ceremonies for newborn
       pets.
     * The country is governed by decree of the Council of England, which
       consists of five people. Parliament has been reduced to an advisory
       role. The aims of the Council are: (1) protection and security, (2)
       comfort, and (3) pleasure, corresponding to the Warden's promises
       of: (1) freedom from fear, (2) freedom from want, and (3) freedom
       from boredom.
     * The Grenadiers, formerly an elite regiment in the British Armed
       Forces, are the Warden's private army. The State Secret Police
       (SSP) ensures the Council's decrees are executed.
     * The courts still exist, but juries have been abolished. Under the
       "new arrangements", defendants are tried by a judge and two
       magistrates. All convicted criminals are dumped at a penal colony
       on the Isle of Man. There is no remission, escape is almost
       impossible, visitors are forbidden, and prisoners may not write or
       receive letters.
     * Every citizen is required to learn skills, such as animal
       husbandry, which they might need to help them survive if they
       happen to be among the last human beings in the UK.
     * Foreign workers are lured into the country and then exploited.
       Young people, preferably Omegas, from poorer countries come to
       England to work there. These "foreign Omegas" or, generally,
       "sojourners", are imported to do undesirable work. At 60, which is
       the age limit, they are sent back ("forcibly repatriated"). British
       Omegas are not allowed to emigrate so as to prevent further loss of
       labour.
     * Elderly/infirm citizens have become a burden; nursing homes are for
       the privileged few. The rest are expected and sometimes forced to
       commit suicide by taking part in a "quietus" (Council-sanctioned
       mass drowning) at age 60.
     * The state has opened "pornography centres" as well as installing
       special transmitters that emit a special kind of radiation designed
       to increase libido. Twice a year, healthy women under 45 must
       submit to a gynaecological examination; and most men must have
       their sperm tested, to keep hope alive.

   Theo's meeting, which turns out to be a meeting with the full Council
   of England, does not go well. Some of the members resent him because he
   resigned as Xan's advisor rather than share the responsibility of
   governing the UK. Xan guesses that Theo's suggestions came from others
   and makes clear to Theo that he will take action against dissidents.

   The Five Fishes distribute a leaflet detailing their demands. The SSP
   visit Theo. He sees Julian in the market shortly afterwards. He tells
   her of the SSP visit, then tells her that if ever she needs him she
   only has to send for him. That night, however, Theo decides to leave
   England for the summer and visit the continent before nature overruns
   it.

   Soon after Theo's return, Miriam tells him that Gascoigne was arrested
   as he was trying to rig a Quietus landing stage to explode. The other
   Fishes are about to go on the run, and Julian wants him. Miriam reveals
   why Julian did not come herself: Julian is pregnant. Theo believes
   Julian is deceiving herself, but when the two meet, Julian invites Theo
   to listen to her baby's heartbeat.

   During the group's flight, Luke is killed while trying to protect
   Julian during a confrontation with a wild gang of Omegas. Julian
   confesses that the father of her child is not Rolf, but rather the
   deceased Luke. Rolf, who believes he should rule the U.K. in Xan's
   place, is angered at the discovery; he abandons the group to notify the
   Warden.

   The group heads to a shack Theo knows of. Miriam delivers Julian's
   baby: a boy, not a girl as Julian had thought. Miriam goes to find more
   supplies; after she is gone too long, Theo investigates. He finds
   Miriam dead, garrotted in a nearby house. Theo returns to Julian, but
   soon afterward Julian hears a noise outside: Xan.

   Theo and Xan confront each other and both fire one shot. The sudden
   wailing of the baby startles Xan, causing him to miss, as Rolf had
   thought the baby would not be born for another month. Theo shoots and
   kills Xan. He removes from Xan's finger the Coronation Ring, which Xan
   had taken to wearing as a symbol of authority, and seems poised to
   become the new leader of the UK (at least temporarily). The other
   members of the Council are introduced to the baby, whom Theo baptises.
