   During WWI, a writer named Ashenden, introduced only by his last name,
   is enlisted as an agent through threats and promises by "R.", a Colonel
   with British Intelligence. He is sent to Switzerland where he becomes
   involved in a number of counter-intelligence operations; these he
   accomplishes by means of persuasion, bribery, blackmail, or
   coincidence. He does not use a weapon.

   In one, he accompanies a man called the Hairless Mexican to Italy,
   where they are to intercept important papers carried by an arriving
   Greek agent of the Germans. The Hairless Mexican meets the only Greek
   on the incoming ship, and during a search of the Greek's hotel room,
   the Hairless Mexican and Ashenden do not find any papers. As they
   prepare to leave the country, Ashenden decodes a cable which tells him
   that the intended Greek had never boarded the ship; spots of dried
   blood on the Hairless Mexican's sleeve mean that he had killed the
   wrong man.

   In another, Ashenden must induce an Italian dancer to betray her lover,
   an anti-British Indian and a German agent, by convincing him to cross
   the border from neutral Switzerland to see her in allied France, where
   the Allies can arrest him. The ironic denouement is that after the man
   is captured by the British, he commits suicide before he can be
   arrested, tried, and executed. When she finds out of his death, the
   dancer goes to Ashenden and asks to get back the valuable watch she had
   given to the man whom she has just betrayed.

   After a number of similar operations, Ashenden is sent to Imperial
   Russia during the 1917 revolution, as an "agent of influence", to do
   what he can to keep Russia in the war against Germany. He spends eleven
   days on the train from Vladivostok to Petrograd sharing a cabin with
   Harrington, an American business man who is a constant
   conversationalist. A few days after they arrive, the revolution breaks
   out in earnest. As they try to evacuate, the business man insists on
   getting back his laundry that had been sent out. During his return with
   the laundry, Harrington is killed in a street riot. The stories combine
   Maugham's talent at character detail with a tragic structure where an
   affecting and sometimes funny person is damaged in the game of national
   spying. Some regard these as the forerunner of all the more sceptical
   spy fiction written by such as Eric Ambler, Graham Greene and books
   such as The Spy Who Came In From the Cold.
