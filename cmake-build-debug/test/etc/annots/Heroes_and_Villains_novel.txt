   In a post-apocalyptic world, Marianne inhabits an enclave of relative
   civilisation as the daughter of one of the "Professors", academic
   survivors of the unnamed global disaster, whose enclave is guarded by a
   soldier caste. At the beginning of the novel, Marianne has lost her
   brother and mother, and only her father survives. However, she has
   become tired of the sedentary lifestyle and runs away from the enclave
   to join Jewel, an articulate and intelligent leader of a barbarian
   tribe, but then becomes concerned at her chattel status in a society
   that has rigid patriarchal concepts of what constitutes appropriate
   gender roles. Marianne becomes pregnant after Jewel sexually assaults
   her but she then sexually assaults an intellectually disabled male
   tribal member. Ultimately Jewel dies, and Marianne plans to become
   tribal leader.
