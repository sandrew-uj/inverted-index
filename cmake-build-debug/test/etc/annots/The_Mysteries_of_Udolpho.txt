   The Mysteries of Udolpho is a quintessential Gothic romance, replete
   with incidents of physical and psychological terror: remote crumbling
   castles, seemingly supernatural events, a brooding, scheming villain
   and a persecuted heroine.

   Modern editors note that only about a third of the novel is set in the
   eponymous Gothic castle, while tone and style vary markedly between
   sections of the work, to which Radcliffe added extended descriptions of
   exotic landscapes in the Pyrenees and Apennines, and of Venice, none of
   which she had visited. For details she relied on travel books,
   which led her to make several anachronisms. The novel, set in 1584 in
   southern France and northern Italy, explores the plight of Emily St.
   Aubert, a young French woman orphaned by the death of her father. She
   is imprisoned in Castle Udolpho by Signor Montoni, an Italian brigand
   who has married her aunt and guardian Madame Cheron. He and others
   frustrate Emily's romance with the dashing Valancourt. Emily also
   investigates a relationship between her father and the Marchioness de
   Villeroi, and its connection to Castle Udolpho.

   Emily St. Aubert is the only child of a landed rural family whose
   fortunes are in decline. Emily and her father share a notably close
   bond in a shared appreciation for nature. They grow still closer after
   her mother's death from illness. She accompanies him on a journey from
   their native Gascony, through the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean coast
   of Roussillon, over many mountainous landscapes. During the journey,
   they encounter Valancourt, a handsome man who also feels an almost
   mystical kinship with the natural world. Emily and Valancourt fall in
   love.

   Emily's father succumbs to a long illness. Emily, now orphaned, is
   forced by his wishes to live with her aunt, Madame Cheron, who shares
   none of Emily's interests and shows little affection for her. Her aunt
   marries Montoni, a dubious nobleman from Italy. He wants his friend
   Count Morano to become Emily's husband and tries to force him upon her.
   After discovering that Morano is nearly ruined, Montoni brings Emily
   and her aunt to his remote castle of Udolpho.

   Emily fears she has lost Valancourt forever. Morano searches for Emily
   and tries to carry her off secretly from Udolpho, but Emily's heart
   still belongs to Valancourt, and she refuses. Morano's attempted escape
   is discovered by Montoni, who wounds the Count and chases him away. In
   subsequent months, Montoni threatens his wife with violence, trying to
   force her to sign over her properties in Toulouse that will otherwise
   go to Emily on his wife's death. Without resigning her estate, Madame
   Cheron dies of a severe illness caused by her husband's harshness.

   Many frightening but coincidental events happen in the castle, but
   Emily manages to flee with the help of a secret admirer, Du Pont, also
   a prisoner there, and of the servants Annette and Ludovico. Returning
   to her aunt's estate, Emily learns that Valancourt has gone to Paris
   and lost his wealth. Nonetheless, she takes control of the property and
   is reunited with Valancourt in the end.
