   Broadcast eleven years after a similar program, Special Bulletin, it
   starts in an identical fashion, with the beginning of "regular
   programming", in this case the opening of a murder mystery film, which
   starred Loni Anderson (appearing in a cameo). Within moments, however,
   the program is interrupted with a news bulletin of a series of three
   earthquakes, one of them located in the Thunder Basin National
   Grassland area of Wyoming. The film resumes but a few moments later is
   interrupted for good as coverage begins of a Halloween night meteor
   impact on the United States.

   It is revealed that additional impacts had been reported in southern
   France and a remote area of China. A scientist notes that the objects
   hit in a mathematically precise way and suggests the impacts may have
   been deliberate.

   Soon, lone survivors are found at the Wyoming and France impact sites:
   a young girl and a young Frenchman. The girl had been reported missing
   from a city hundreds of miles away from the impact. Both people are
   severely burned and are speaking in unintelligible syllables.

   The three impact sites begin broadcasting an ear-piercing radio signal
   that cripples aircraft flying within latitudes immediately surrounding
   the impacts. Then, another larger object is detected moving towards the
   North Pole. The United States, despite protests from world leaders and
   scientists, orders several aircraft to intercept the object before it
   impacts with the earth and destroy it using nuclear weapons. This is
   successful, although all aircraft are destroyed, apparently by a signal
   coming from the new object.

   A scientist, named Dr. Avram Mandel, who has been studying the impacts
   is flown by an F-16 to a U.S. military base where reporters are being
   briefed on the latest incident. He reveals that his determination is
   that the impacts were in fact an attempt at first contact by an alien
   species and that, by destroying the follow-up aircraft, Earth has
   declared war on the aliens. As if that wasn't enough, more than
   two-thirds of the public (or 72% for that matter) now believe that the
   objects have been connected to alien life, according to a telephone
   poll.

   Other mysteries occur. At one point, the population of an entire town
   vanishes without a trace. It has been suggested that this occurred not
   as a result of the attacks, but in fact may have been a reference to
   one of the more extreme interpretations of the rapture. The town's name
   is Faith, Wyoming, supporting this reference.

   Dr. Mandel's fears are confirmed when he later reveals that there are
   three more objects, each 2 miles wide, approaching Earth. Unlike last
   time, when they were aimed (intentionally, it is suggested) at lightly
   inhabited areas, these new objects have been directly aimed at
   Washington, D.C., Moscow, and Beijing - not coincidentally, the capital
   cities of the three biggest holders of nuclear weapons. Over the course
   of the night, the young Frenchman and the young girl are identified as
   Jean-Paul Chounard and 8-year-old Kimberly Hastings, respectively,
   before eventually dying.

   Over the next few minutes, nuclear weapons are launched to intercept
   these three objects successfully (although Washington is nearly hit).

   With a sigh of relief, the news anchors report success. Meanwhile,
   scientists are able to finally decipher the young girl and the young
   Frenchman's speech. It turns out they are each speaking a fragment of a
   message. When combined (although not complete as the assumed third
   survivor is never located), the message appears to be reciting of the
   message from the U.N. Secretary General that had been included on a
   special recording sent with the Voyager space probes, more
   specifically, Voyager 2.

   Moments later, astronomers detect hundreds more asteroids, all heading
   towards Earth. As anchor Sander Vanocur and a terrified Dr. Caroline
   Jaffe, realizing that aliens were indeed behind all that has happened,
   await the inevitable destruction of the planet, hearing reports of
   cities and entire countries being destroyed worldwide, Vanocur solemnly
   quotes from William Shakespeare, "The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in
   our stars, but in ourselves," as a rumble is heard and the picture cuts
   to static.

   The nature of the aliens and their reason for contacting Earth is never
   revealed, and they are never seen. Similarly the exact nature or
   reasoning of their "hello" message--the crashing of three meteor-like
   objects into Earth--is left a mystery, as is the intent and purpose of
   the follow-up vessel that is destroyed by the military. A third
   survivor of the original impacts is assumed throughout, but given the
   remote region in which the Chinese impact occurred, this individual is
   never located during the time frame.
