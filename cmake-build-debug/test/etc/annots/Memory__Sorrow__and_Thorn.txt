   Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn takes place on the fictional continent of
   Osten Ard, home to several united races, including humans, elf-like
   immortals known as Sithi, and dwarf-like mountain-dwellers named Qanuc.
   Most of these races have been living in relative unity for decades,
   thanks to King John the Presbyter (also known as Prester John), who is
   known to have slain a dragon. The first novel opens when Prester John's
   health in his advanced age is failing and his sons, Elias and Josua,
   quarrel over who will ascend to the throne. Meanwhile, a dark secret
   held by Prester John, and the ambitions of a priest named Pryrates,
   threaten the stability of the continent. Williams used several
   characters, both villain and protagonist, as point of view characters
   throughout the scope of the novels.

   The series primarily follows Simon, a lowly kitchen scullion in Hayholt
   Castle, as he undergoes tutelage from Doctor Morgenes and is cared for
   by Rachel "the Dragon", the matriarch of the castle's kitchen and
   chambermaids. As King John passes, Elias takes the throne, with the
   mysterious priest Pryrates as his advisor; Josua mysteriously
   disappears, and the seasons begin changing, bringing bitter winters and
   drought-laden summers. Simon, ever the mischievous adventurer,
   accidentally uncovers some of Pryrates' true nature and becomes wrapped
   into a conspiracy that not only threatens his country of Erkynland, but
   Osten Ard itself.
