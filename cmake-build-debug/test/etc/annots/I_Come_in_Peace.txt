   Houston police officer Jack Caine will not let police procedure prevent
   him from pursuing his mission to wipe out the White Boys, a gang of
   white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while Caine was
   stopping a convenience store robbery.

   The White Boys disguise their narcotics trafficking behind rows of
   expensive luxury sports cars, executive level jobs, and flashy designer
   suits. Led by the vicious but urbane Victor Manning, the White Boys
   operate above accusation but not suspicion. When the White Boys steal a
   shipment of heroin from a federal evidence warehouse, they hide
   evidence of their involvement by blowing up the facility, killing or
   injuring numerous people. This brings in the FBI, and Caine is
   partnered with a by-the-book agent Arwood "Larry" Smith. They
   investigate the drug theft and the later murder of several key White
   Boys soldiers by a hyper fast spinning disk. At the same time, Caine is
   made aware - via his girlfriend, coroner Diane Pallone - of a series of
   drug-related deaths. The corpses are full of heroin, but the cause of
   death is a puncture wound to the forehead. Unknown to Caine and the
   police officers, the deaths are caused by Talec, an alien who is
   extracting something from the victims, but is being pursued by Azeck, a
   similar alien to himself.

   Azeck soon tracks Talec to a supermarket where a battle ensues. After
   being severely injured in the fight, Azeck is able to sneak into
   Caine's car as Caine and Smith investigate the bloody scene left at the
   super market. After Cane and Smith are ordered off the investigation by
   their superiors, they discover the mortally wounded Azeck. Azeck
   explains that he is a police officer from his own home planet, and that
   Talec shoots his victims full of synthetic heroin and then uses alien
   technology to extract the resulting endorphins from their brains,
   synthesizing them into a drug called "Barsi" to be used by addicts on
   his home planet. He warns Caine and Smith that if Talec is not stopped,
   thousands of intergalactic drug dealers will start to come to Earth to
   slaughter its population, as Earth is a cheap source of Barsi which is
   extremely rare in the rest of the galaxy. Azeck dies and his body
   cremates itself - but Smith has retained Azeck's powerful hand-gun and
   intends to pass it onto his FBI superior to prove that the aliens
   exist. Cain warns that Switzer should not be trusted and wants to give
   the gun to his own Chief Malone. The two disagree and separate.

   Smith gives the weapon to Inspector Switzer, who reveals that they
   already know about the aliens and intend on opening dialogue with Talec
   in order to gain technological and weapon advantages. He then attempts
   to shoot Smith, but Caine saves him at the last moment. Thanks to
   information from Azeck, they track Talec down to an industrial complex
   but are waylaid by the White Boys who believe Caine to be behind the
   deaths of their soldiers. Talec arrives in the middle of the standoff
   and kills the remaining White Boys before being forced to retreat after
   Smith uses Azeck's weapon against him.

   At the complex, Azeck's weapon runs out of charge and Talec attempts to
   kill Caine using his drug harpoon. While fending off the harpoon Caine
   grabs a vial of the synthesized Barsi drug and the two engage in
   hand-to-hand combat over the vial, resulting in Talec being impaled on
   a steel spar. Cain retrieves Talec's gun - a similar weapon to Azeck's
   - and shoots nearby drums of fuel, killing Talec in the resulting
   explosion.

   With Talec dead, Caine and Smith realize that they have completed
   Azeck's mission: Talec won't return to his home planet, so no one from
   his home planet knows about Earth.
