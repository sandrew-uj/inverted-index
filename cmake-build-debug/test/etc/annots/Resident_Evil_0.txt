   On July 23, 1998, a train owned by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella,
   the Ecliptic Express, comes under attack from a swarm of leeches. As
   the passengers and crew are attacked, a mysterious young man watches
   over the resulting chaos from a hillside. Two hours later, the Bravo
   Team of the Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) police
   force is sent to investigate a series of cannibalistic murders in the
   Arklay Mountains outside of Raccoon City. On the way to the scene, its
   helicopter has an engine failure and crash-lands in a forest. While
   searching the immediate area, Officer Rebecca Chambers of Bravo Team
   comes across the Express, now motionless, and explores it, only to find
   the passengers and crew transformed into zombies, unaware their
   transformation was a result of exposure to Umbrella's T-virus contained
   within the leeches. As she explores the train for answers, she teams up
   with Billy Coen--a former Marine Force Reconnaissance officer, who was
   to be executed for killing 23 people until the military police van
   transporting him crashed within the region.

   The pair soon notices the same mysterious young man, moments before the
   train suddenly begins moving again. Unbeknownst to the pair, two
   soldiers from Umbrella, on the orders of Albert Wesker and William
   Birkin, attempt to take control of the train and destroy it, but are
   killed by leeches before they can complete their mission. As the train
   speeds out of control, Rebecca and Billy apply the brakes and avert its
   course towards an abandoned building. Upon exploring the area, they
   discover it to be a disused training facility for future executives of
   Umbrella, and that the former director of the facility and the
   corporation's co-founder, Dr. James Marcus, was responsible for
   discovering the so-called Progenitor virus in the 1960s, and decided to
   examine its potential as a biological weapon. He combined it with leech
   DNA to develop the T-virus that causes rapid mutations in living
   organisms and thus transforms humans and animals into zombies and
   monsters.

   As the pair continue to explore the facility, Wesker decides to leave
   Umbrella and join its rival company, and makes plans for further
   research on the T-virus, while Birkin refuses his offer to join him,
   instead opting to complete his research on the G-virus. Later, Rebecca
   becomes separated from Billy. On her own, she encounters Captain Enrico
   Marini, who tells her that the rest of the Bravo team will meet up at
   an old mansion they found, but allows her to stay behind to find Billy.
   Just after Enrico leaves, Rebecca is attacked by the Tyrant. After
   temporarily defeating the Tyrant, Rebecca meets up with Billy again
   and, together, they defeat it and continue on towards a water plant.

   Eventually, Rebecca and Billy catch up with the leech-controlling man,
   who happens to be Marcus' final experiment, Queen Leech. Ten years
   earlier, Marcus was assassinated on the orders of Umbrella's other
   co-founder, Oswell E. Spencer, who sought his research. After his
   corpse was dumped, Queen Leech entered his body and reanimated it,
   gaining his memories and the ability to shapeshift, whereupon it
   believed itself to be Marcus and orchestrated the T-virus outbreak in
   the facility and on the train as a means of revenge against Umbrella.
   After temporarily defeating it, Billy and Rebecca attempt to escape to
   the surface via a lift, just as William Birkin trips the facility's
   self-destruct mechanism. Pursued by Queen Leech, the pair eventually
   kill it and escape before the facility is destroyed. Following their
   escape, Rebecca notices the mansion that Marini mentioned and prepares
   to head for it. Before she does, she assures Billy that her police
   report will list him as another casualty of the incident. Thanking her
   for his freedom, Billy departs as Rebecca heads towards the mansion to
   seek out the whereabouts of her fellow Bravo Team members (seen in
   Resident Evil).
