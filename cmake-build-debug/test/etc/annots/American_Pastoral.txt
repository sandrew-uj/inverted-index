   Seymour Irving Levov is born and raised in the Weequahic section of
   Newark, New Jersey, in 1927 as the elder son of a successful Jewish
   American glove manufacturer, Lou Levov, and his wife Sylvia. Called
   "the Swede" because of his anomalous blond hair, blue eyes and Nordic
   good looks, Seymour is a star athlete in high school, a two-year
   veteran of the Marine Corps, and the narrator Nathan Zuckerman's idol
   and hero. Zuckerman and Seymour's younger brother, Jerry--who grows
   into a curmudgeonly, irascible heart surgeon with little empathy for
   the Swede--are schoolmates and close friends. The Swede eventually
   takes over his father's glove factory and marries Dawn Dwyer, a former
   beauty queen from nearby Elizabeth, whom he met in college.

   Seymour establishes what he believes to be a perfect American life with
   a beloved wife and daughter, a satisfying business career, and a
   magnificent house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. Yet, as the
   Vietnam War and racial unrest wrack the country and destroy inner-city
   Newark, his precocious teenage daughter Meredith ("Merry"), beset by an
   emotionally debilitating stutter and outraged by the war, becomes
   increasingly radical in her beliefs. In February 1968, Merry plants a
   bomb in the Old Rimrock post office, which kills a bystander; she goes
   into permanent hiding. Seymour finds Merry five years later, living in
   deplorable conditions in inner-city Newark. During this reunion, Merry
   reveals that she was responsible for several more bombings, killing
   three more people. Although Merry informs him that her actions were
   deliberate, Seymour decides to keep their meeting a secret, believing
   Merry has been manipulated by an unknown political group and a
   mysterious woman named Rita Cohen.

   At a dinner party, Seymour discovers that his wife Dawn has been having
   an affair with Princeton-educated architect William Orcutt III, for
   whom she undergoes a facelift. Seymour then realizes that his wife is
   planning to leave him for Orcutt. It is revealed that Seymour himself
   previously had a short-term affair with Merry's speech therapist,
   Sheila Salzman, and that she and her husband Shelly hid Merry in their
   home after the post office bombing. Seymour sadly concludes that
   everyone he knows may have a veneer of respectability, but each engages
   in subversive behavior and that he cannot understand the truth about
   anyone based upon the conduct they outwardly display. He is forced to
   see the truth about the chaos and discord rumbling beneath the
   "American pastoral", which has brought about profound personal and
   societal changes he no longer can ignore. Simultaneously, the dinner
   party underscores the fact that no one ever truly understands the
   hearts of other people.
