   In the Adventure mode titled "The Subspace Emissary", Mario and Kirby
   face each other on a stadium located in the Smash Bros. world. In this
   world, when a fighter is defeated, they become a trophy which can be
   revived by touching the base. Suddenly, the Battleship Halberd appears,
   releasing a stream of black, purple-clouded Shadow Bugs that form the
   soldiers of the Subspace Army. The Ancient Minister, the cloaked,
   mysterious Subspace General, arrives and detonates a Subspace Bomb,
   which can only be detonated by the sacrifice of two R.O.B units, and
   transports the stadium into Subspace, an alternate dimension where the
   Subspace Army resides. The Ancient Minister's advance prompts the
   heroes to ally and attempt to repel the enemy, while villains harvest
   the power of the allied characters by using dark cannons to convert
   them into trophies and using Shadow Bugs on some of them to create
   powerful doppelgaengers. King Dedede begins independently gathering
   some fallen fighters' trophies, placing golden brooches on them.

   The Ancient Minister is revealed as a subordinate to Ganondorf, Bowser,
   and Wario, who are under orders from Master Hand to draw the world into
   Subspace. Wario, who had stolen Ness with his dark cannon, is turned
   into a trophy by a Pokemon Trainer and Lucas, and is then helplessly
   sucked in by a Subspace Bomb. Meanwhile, Meta Knight leaves his group
   to reclaim his stolen ship, the Halberd. He allies with Lucario and
   Snake, reaching the cockpit and destroying the Mr. Game & Watch clones
   piloting the battleship.

   The Ancient Minister's true identity is found to be that of the Master
   R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied
   characters. Bowser and Ganondorf detonate several bombs on their Isle
   of the Ancients base to create a subspace portal large enough to summon
   their Subspace Gunship weapon. The three major groups converge and use
   the Halberd to battle the Gunship. Although the Halberd is destroyed,
   all of the characters escape unscathed and Ganondorf and Bowser retreat
   after Kirby destroys the Gunship with his Dragoon. Ganondorf betrays
   Bowser and turns him into a trophy, only to learn that Master Hand was
   being manipulated by the actual Subspace Army leader, Tabuu, who turns
   Ganondorf into a trophy and defeats Master Hand.

   The allied characters enter Tabuu's chamber, but Tabuu annihilates them
   all with powerful "Off Waves" and scatters them all throughout
   Subspace. Dedede's brooches are revealed as a fail-safe against Tabuu's
   Off Waves and revive Luigi, Dedede, Ness, and Kirby, who rescue the
   characters scattered across Subspace and navigate a great maze where
   Tabuu is located. As Tabuu is about to use his Off Waves to turn the
   characters back into trophies, he is ambushed by Sonic, who weakens
   him; the fighters defeat Tabuu and save the Smash Bros. universe.

   In the final scene, the fighters look at a great luminous cross on the
   horizon where the Isle of the Ancients once resided.
