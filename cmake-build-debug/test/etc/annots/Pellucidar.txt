   Pellucidar is a fictional Hollow Earth invented by American writer
   Edgar Rice Burroughs for a series of action adventure stories.^[1] In a
   crossover (fiction) event between Burroughs's series, there is a Tarzan
   story in which he travels into Pellucidar.

   The stories initially involve the adventures of mining heir David Innes
   and his inventor friend Abner Perry after they use an "iron mole" to
   burrow 500 miles into the Earth's crust. Later protagonists include
   indigenous caveman Tanar and additional visitors from the surface
   world, notably Tarzan, Jason Gridley, and Frederich Wilhelm Eric von
   Mendeldorf und von Horst.^[2]
