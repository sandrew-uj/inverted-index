   The plot centers around the Johnson family (consisting of Chris (Rob
   Hartz) and Ellen (Kathleen Cameron) Johnson, and their son Casey (Hy
   Rillero)) of Los Angeles, California, one of a small number of families
   to survive a global pandemic that, according to the opening of the
   film, occurs "sometime in the future..." The disease began as a
   particularly virulent flu strain in Southeast Asia. Efforts made to
   contain the virus in that portion of the world are ineffective as
   global transportation networks carry infected individuals all around
   the world. Hospitals become overloaded, and the public works
   infrastructure begins to shut down. Eventually, the main characters
   leave L.A., encountering many hardships along the way. They make it to
   a friendly small town, where life begins again.

   Interspersed with the above are interviews with various experts giving
   their perspective on what is most likely to occur in a global pandemic
   scenario.
