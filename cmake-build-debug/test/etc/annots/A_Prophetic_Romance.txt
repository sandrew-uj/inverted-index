   A Prophetic Romance: Mars to Earth is an 1896 utopian novel written by
   John McCoy, and published pseudonymously as the work of "The Lord
   Commissioner," the narrator of the tale.^[1] The book is one element in
   the major wave of utopian and dystopian literature that characterized
   the final decades of the nineteenth century.^[2]^[3]^[4]

   The story is written in a form resembling an epistolary novel: it
   consists of a series of reports from a Martian government official, the
   Lord Commissioner. He has been sent to Earth by the "Chancellor
   Commander" of Mars, the head of that planet's unified government, to
   report on terrestrial conditions. (The Martians are more advanced than
   humans, and have explored the solar system.) The time of the story is
   not specified, though details in the text suggest the late twentieth
   century, about a hundred years after the book's publication.

   The Lord Commissioner travels to Earth by spaceship; he endures
   hallucinations due to the interplanetary "atmosphere." He lands at
   "Midland," the capital of the United States, and meets the president,
   who happens to be a woman. American society has been reformulated after
   a revolution around the turn of the twentieth century, when irate
   citizens blew up the Capitol and its congressmen. Laws must be approved
   by popular referenda before they take effect. The United States has
   expanded to include Canada and Central America. The salaries of
   business executives are limited. Gender equality has been achieved.

   Technology has made major advances, including aircraft and electric
   cars; there is even a "lovemeter" that detects emotions. Vegetarianism
   is dominant, and alcohol abuse is a thing of the past. The Bible has
   been edited, with the bloody parts removed. Divorces are uncommon, and
   hard to obtain.

   The Lord Commissioner falls in love with an Earth woman named Loleta, a
   friend of the president; he decides to remain on Earth with her.^[5]
