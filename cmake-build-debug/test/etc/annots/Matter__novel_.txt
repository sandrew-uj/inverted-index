   The book follows the experiences of three members of the royal
   household of the Sarl, a feudal, early-industrial humanoid race living
   on the eighth level of the Shellworld of Sursamen. Constructed for an
   unknown purpose by a long-dead race called the Veil, Shellworlds are
   ancient artificial planets consisting of nested concentric spheres
   internally lit by tiny thermonuclear "stars". The spheres are inhabited
   by various primitive races along with progressively more advanced
   mentoring species, up to the level of what the Sarl call "Optimae."
   (The Optimae themselves, particularly the Culture, prefer the term
   "Involved.") Approximately 4,000 Shellworlds were built, but almost
   2,000 were deliberately destroyed, for reasons unknown, by another
   presumed extinct race, the Iln. Like many Shellwords, the core of
   Sursamen is known to be inhabited by a mysterious creature called a
   Xinthian Tensile Aeranothaur, whom the Sarl worship as their
   "WorldGod."

   Prince Ferbin, the self-centred heir to the Sarl throne, has to flee
   his home level on the Shellworld and the Shellworld itself after
   witnessing the murder of his father, King Hausk, by Mertis tyl Loesp,
   the King's second-in-command. Prince Oramen, Ferbin's studious younger
   brother, is unaware of the treachery and trusts tyl Loesp fully. After
   Ferbin's disappearance--and presumed death--tyl Loesp takes on the role
   of regent, ostensibly until Prince Regent Oramen comes of age and can
   be crowned king.

   The Oct, the direct mentoring species over the human Sarl, meanwhile
   have been organizing the takeover of the ninth level of Sursamen (owned
   by the Deldeyn, another human nation of approximately equal level of
   development to the Sarl), using the Sarl royal court and military as
   their pawns. It becomes increasingly clear that they are searching for
   something hidden in the Nameless City, a metropolis buried under
   several hundred million years of sediment which is currently being
   stripped away by the giant Hyeng-zhar waterfalls. The ninth level was
   only recently re-colonised in a move by the Oct, which was
   retrospectively validated, with reluctance, by Sursamen's mentoring
   races, the Nariscene and the more senior Morthanveld. (The Culture
   itself has no jurisdiction over Sursamen, since the Morthanveld are -
   like the Culture - "High Level Involved", technically regarded as
   sort-of-equals in an uneasy although peaceful diplomatic relationship:
   although despite this, the human(oid) Sarl seem to have more affinity
   with the Culture although their hierarchy of patronage comes from the
   Morthanveld.) Opposed to the Oct at an approximately equal stage of
   development are another species, the Aultridia, who opposed the Oct's
   incursions into the ninth level, and there is a risk of Oct/Aultridia
   war breaking out - which may become worse if the intermediate-level
   Nariscene, themselves patrons of the Oct, are dragged into involvement,
   or worse still, the high-level Morthanveld themselves.

   Elsewhere, Djan Seriy Anaplian, another child of King Hausk, had left
   Sursamen fifteen years earlier to become a member of the Culture as
   part of a cultural exchange and later joined the Culture's covert
   Special Circumstances (SC) intelligence and intervention organisation.
   Anaplian decides to return to Sursamen, originally to pay her respects
   to her dead father and presumed-dead brother. (Initial reports from
   Sursamen only described the king and prince's causes of death as combat
   related.) Meanwhile, the fleeing Ferbin is seeking out his long-absent
   sister hoping that, with her powerful connections and SC access, she
   could help install him as rightful king of the Sarl.

   Within the Culture, other channels of intelligence later validate
   suspicions that the Oct are planning something mysterious on Sursamen
   and SC contacts Anaplian en route via a humanoid avatar of the Culture
   ship Liveware Problem, Klatsli Quike. SC asks Anaplian to investigate,
   upgrading her bereavement travel to an official Culture mission - one
   which will be necessarily highly sensitive since Sursamen is not under
   Culture jurisdiction, nor are any of the species involved in the
   Morthanveld chain of patronage. Quike is soon replaced by another
   avatoid of The Liveware Problem, Pone Hippinse, as Anaplian's tactical
   partner in the mission. Her rather irritable combat drone, Turminder
   Xuss, had stowed away in her belongings at the beginning of her
   journey, disguised initially as a Knife Missile resembling a dildo;
   Anaplian has had most SC tactical enhancements to her mind and body
   disabled for her personal journey out of diplomatic considerations, but
   she restores most of them, and Xuss will prove critically useful. At
   this point, Anaplian is reunited with her fugitive brother, Ferbin, and
   his faithful (but increasingly independently minded) servant Choubris
   Holse.

   Arriving at Sursamen on board the Liveware Problem, the team (Anaplian,
   Hippinse, Ferbin, Holse and Xuss) successfully infiltrate their way
   down to the Shellworld's ninth level to confront tyl Loesp, and protect
   their brother, Prince Oramen, both of whom are overseeing the
   excavation of the Nameless City. By the time the team arrives, Oramen
   has survived assassination attempts by tyl Loesp, but has been killed
   by a mysterious and powerful entity long entombed in the ancient ruins.
   Oramen had discovered--too late--that the entity is a ruthless machine
   created by or belonging to the long-dead race known as the Iln.

   The liberated Iln machine's nature is a horrible surprise to the Sarl
   humans and especially the Oct, who thought that they were excavating
   one of the "Involucra" (aka the Veil) who had originally built the
   shellworlds and from whom they claim to be descended. The Iln entity
   kills all nearby Sarl and Octs - including both Oramen and tyl Loesp -
   with a small thermonuclear explosion--after thanking them for their
   help--and heads towards the core of the Shellworld, planning to capture
   the Xinthian "WorldGod" and then destroy Sursamen by generating and
   detonating antimatter.

   With both tyl Loesp and their brother dead on the ninth level, Anaplian
   and Ferbin descend towards the Shellworld's core level with the rest of
   the team, equipped with intelligent SC-technology combat suits. The
   Liveware Problem itself speeds down a vast shaft into the Shellworld's
   interior to lead the team, but sustains substantial damage from
   Nariscene weapons during its descent to the core (it becoming
   increasingly apparent that all the various species involved have been
   getting their hands on technology from at least one level higher up the
   chain). The team is thus outgunned by the Iln device, which has taken
   over a Morthanveld guard ship and twelve other drones secretly emplaced
   in the core. Xuss is MIA. Hippinse's parent ship, the Liveware Problem,
   disposes of all but two of the Morthanveld drones then sacrifices
   itself in a suicide attack on the hijacked Morthanveld guard ship.
   Hippinse himself is killed eliminating one of the remaining drones;
   Anaplian accounts for the last one, but the Iln entity remains too
   strong for the remaining compatriots, whose resources are seriously
   depleted.

   Ferbin sacrifices himself to the Iln machine and is killed outright,
   but satisfies the enemy that the humans are not dangerous and permits
   Anaplian a much closer approach. Despite her advanced armour, she is
   eviscerated beyond the point where a non-SC enhanced human would be
   dead, but she remains conscious enough to detonate the tiny grain of
   antimatter in her skull that provided power to her SC-enhanced body,
   destroying the Iln entity and saving the Shellworld.

   In the epilogue, Holse, the lone survivor of the Iln encounter, rejoins
   his family after a long absence, accompanied by the surviving Liveware
   Problem avatoid, Quike. He declares his intention to become a political
   leader of a no-longer-monarchist Sarl, with the secret backing of the
   Culture.
