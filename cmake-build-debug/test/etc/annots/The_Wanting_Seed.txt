   The novel begins by introducing the two protagonists: Tristram Foxe, a
   history teacher, and his wife, Beatrice-Joanna, a homemaker. They have
   recently suffered through their young son's death.

   Throughout the first portion of the novel, overpopulation is depicted
   through the limitation and reuse of materials, and extremely cramped
   living conditions.

   There is also active discrimination against heterosexuals,
   homosexuality being encouraged as a measure against overpopulation.
   Self-sterilization is also encouraged.

   One of the major conflicts of the novel is between Tristram and his
   brother, Derek. Very much alike at first, Derek chose a different path
   from Tristram and pretends to be homosexual while in public, to help
   his career as a government official. Derek has an affair with
   Beatrice-Joanna, and when she forgets to take her State-provided
   contraceptives she becomes illegally pregnant. She has sex with her
   husband, Tristram, and his brother, Derek, within a 24-hour time span,
   thus the paternity of her twin boys is uncertain.

   Life changes as the largely homosexual police ('greyboys') become more
   repressive, and a mysterious blight spreads across the world
   threatening food supplies. Tristram is arrested after getting
   unintentionally mixed up in a protest and spends the next section of
   the novel in jail.

   While he is imprisoned, formerly repressed religion begins to bloom,
   fertility rituals are endorsed, and the structure of society, as well
   as government, undergoes radical transformation. Cannibalism is openly
   practised in much of England. Beatrice-Joanna has run away, and is
   staying with her sister and brother-in-law in the countryside on their
   farm, where the blight is affecting even their chickens. She stays
   there until she delivers her twin sons, when members of the Population
   Police arrives to take her and her children to the city.

   With the help of his cellmate, Tristram escapes and tries to rejoin his
   wife. He travels across England to his sister-in-law's farm. He is so
   desperate for food that he briefly joins "a dining club", a rather
   chaotic affair which provides food (composed of murdered human beings)
   and orgiastic behavior for its village membership.

   His journey eventually takes him to a sort of soup kitchen, where he
   enlists in the newly recreated army, which has replaced the (largely
   eaten) greyboys and Population Police. This is the third section of the
   novel. In the army, Tristram is shipped to an unknown location to fight
   in the war, though the reader later discovers that he is in Ireland. In
   his first battle he discovers that there is no real enemy; the purpose
   of the "war" is population control by winnowing out the socially
   expendable. Companies, led by junior officers trained to recite
   patriotic verse, are sent to a made-up Western Front style battlefield
   to kill each other. Every other member of his unit is shot down as they
   emerge from their trench, but Tristram slips through the barbed wire
   surrounding the miniature war zone and begins his journey back to
   England.

   Escaping back into general society, Tristram finds a new job. In his
   absence, Beatrice-Joanna has been moved to live with Derek. She has
   also brought the twins (it is implied that Derek is their father) and
   named them after her two brotherly lovers, Derek and Tristram Foxe.

   At the last scene Tristram meets again his wife at Brighton pier.

   The book closes with a translation of the final stanza of the French
   poet Paul Valery's poem 'Le Cimetiere marin'. The quotation clarifies
   the book's themes:

     The wind rises... we must try to live. The immense air opens and
     closes my book. The wave, pulverised, dares to gush and spatter from
     the rocks. Fly away, dazzled, blinded pages. Break, waves. Break
     with joyful waters...
