   The main character is an unnamed 'whisky priest', who combines a great
   power for self-destruction with pitiful cravenness, an almost painful
   penitence, and a desperate quest for dignity. By the end, though,
   the priest "acquires a real holiness." The other principal
   character is a police lieutenant tasked with hunting down this priest.
   This Lieutenant - also unnamed but thought to be based upon Tomas
   Garrido Canabal - is a committed socialist who despises the Church.

   The overall situation is this: Catholicism is outlawed in Mexico.
   However, while the other states of Mexico seem to follow a
   Don't-ask-don't-tell policy, the state of Tabasco enforces the ban
   rigorously. Mexico, or at least Tabasco, is ruled on socialist grounds,
   and priests have either been settled by the state with wives (breaking
   celibacy) and pensions in exchange for their renouncing the faith and
   being strictly banned from fulfilling priestly functions (such as one
   Padre Jose), or else have left the state or are on the run, or have
   been shot. The story starts with the arrival of the main character in a
   small country town and then follows him on his trip through Tabasco,
   where he tries to minister to the people as best he can. In doing so,
   he is faced by a lot of problems, not least of which is that Tabasco is
   also prohibitionist, with the unspoken prime objective to hinder
   celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass, for which actual wine is an
   essential. (It is, therefore, quite easy to get, say, brandy or
   tequila, despite it being forbidden, but very difficult to get wine.)
   He is also haunted by his personal problems and past and present sins,
   especially by the fact that he fathered a child in his parish some
   years before; additionally, his use of spirits may be bordering on
   addiction and certainly is beyond the limit of good measure in his own
   view. (In one scene, both of these problems are mixed: the protagonist
   tries to procure a bottle of wine for Holy Mass, needing to go to very
   high officials to do so, with an additional bottle of brandy for cover
   and also for his personal use; not being able to reveal himself, he is
   talked into emptying the wine on the spot and in vain tries to offer
   the brandy instead.)

   As for his daughter, he meets her, but is unable to feel repentant
   about what happened. Rather, he feels a deep love for the evil-looking
   and awkward little girl and decides to do everything in his power to
   save her from damnation. During his journey the priest also encounters
   a mestizo who later reveals himself to be a Judas figure. The chief
   antagonist, however, is the lieutenant, who is morally irreproachable,
   yet cold and inhumane. While he is supposedly "living for the people",
   he puts into practice a diabolic plan of taking hostages from villages
   and shooting them, if it proves that the priest has sojourned in a
   village but is not denounced. The lieutenant has also had bad
   experiences with the church in his youth, and as a result there is a
   personal element in his search for the whisky priest. The lieutenant
   thinks that all members of the clergy are fundamentally evil, and
   believes that the church is corrupt, and does nothing but provide
   delusion to the people.

   In his flight from the lieutenant and his posse, the priest escapes
   into a neighbouring province, only to re-connect with the mestizo, who
   persuades the priest to return to hear the confession of a dying man.
   Though the priest suspects that it is a trap, he feels compelled to
   fulfil his priestly duty. Although he finds the dying man, it is a trap
   and the lieutenant captures the priest. The lieutenant admits he has
   nothing against the priest as a man, but he must be shot "as a danger".
   On the eve of the execution, the lieutenant shows mercy and attempts to
   enlist Padre Jose to hear the condemned man's confession (which in
   extremis the Church would allow, and which the protagonist has agreed
   to), but the effort is thwarted by Padre Jose's wife. The lieutenant is
   convinced that he has "cleared the province of priests". In the final
   scene, however, another priest arrives in the town. One faithful
   Catholic woman we had previously encountered telling lives of the
   saints in the underground has added the life of the protagonist to her
   repertoire, while forbidding her son to ever remember that this priest
   smelled strangely out of his mouth. This, among other possible
   readings, suggests that the Catholic Church cannot be destroyed. On a
   lighter level, it also suggests that a certain type of devotee will
   ever try to smooth down rough-edged saints into Fairchild family-like
   picturebook heroes, even if it stands in the way of properly
   celebrating their very real faith and heroism.
