   Dale Sutton, a recent graduate from the Space Academy, is assigned to
   the Albatross, a decrepit old spaceship. When the Albatross is assigned
   to explore the mysterious ringed planet Saturn, Dale remembers the
   story of Captain Dearborn who had commanded the first and last mission
   to Saturn. When the Albatross reaches Saturn's moon Titan, the
   superstitious fears of the crew are realized as equipment begins to
   disappear, and eventually people.
