   Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in New York City
   by whatever means necessary, including a series of small-time
   confidence scams. One day, he is approached by shipping magnate Herbert
   Greenleaf to travel to "Mongibello", in Italy, to persuade Greenleaf's
   errant son, Dickie, to return to the United States and join the family
   business. Ripley agrees, exaggerating his friendship with Dickie, a
   half-remembered acquaintance, in order to gain the elder Greenleaf's
   trust.

   Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley meets Dickie and Dickie's
   girlfriend Marge Sherwood, and Dickie allows Tom Ripley to stay with
   him in his Italian home. As Ripley and Dickie spend more time together,
   Marge feels left out. However, soon after Ripley arrives, Freddie
   Miles, a school friend of Dickie's, visits Dickie's summer home. Tom
   begins to grow jealous of Freddie, and grows closer to Marge over their
   shared anguish in Dickie's shifting loyalty.

   Dickie becomes upset when he unexpectedly finds Ripley in his bedroom
   dressed up in his clothes and imitating his mannerisms. From this
   moment on, Ripley senses that Dickie has begun to tire of him,
   resenting his constant presence and growing personal dependence. Ripley
   has indeed become obsessed with Dickie, which is further reinforced by
   his desire to imitate and maintain the wealthy lifestyle Dickie has
   afforded him. As a gesture to Ripley, Dickie agrees to travel with him
   on a short holiday to San Remo. Sensing that he is about to cut him
   loose, Ripley finally decides to murder Dickie and assume his identity.
   When the two set sail in a small rented boat, Ripley beats him to death
   with an oar, dumps his anchor-weighted body into the water, and
   scuttles the boat.

   Ripley assumes Dickie's identity, living off the latter's trust fund
   and carefully providing communications to Marge to assure her that
   Dickie has dumped her. Ripley forges checks and changes his appearance
   to better resemble Dickie in order to continue the lavish lifestyle he
   has enjoyed. Freddie Miles, an old friend of Dickie's from Dickie's
   same social set, encounters Ripley at what he supposes to be Dickie's
   apartment in Rome; he soon suspects something is wrong. When Miles
   finally confronts him, Ripley kills him with a stone bust found in his
   presumed apartment. He later disposes of the body on the outskirts of
   Rome, attempting to make the police believe that robbers have murdered
   Miles.

   Ripley enters a cat-and-mouse game with the Italian police but manages
   to keep himself safe by restoring his own identity and moving to
   Venice. In succession, Marge, Dickie's father, and an American private
   detective confront Ripley, who suggests to them that Dickie was
   depressed and may have committed suicide. Marge stays for a while at
   Ripley's rented house in Venice. When she discovers Dickie's rings in
   Ripley's possession, she seems to be on the verge of realizing the
   truth. Panicked, Ripley contemplates murdering Marge, but she is saved
   when she says that if Dickie gave his rings to Ripley, then he probably
   meant to kill himself.

   The story concludes with Ripley traveling to Greece and resigning
   himself to eventually getting caught. However, he discovers that the
   Greenleaf family has accepted that Dickie is dead and that they have
   transferred his inheritance to Ripley - in accordance with a will
   forged by Ripley on Dickie's Hermes typewriter. Though Marge is still
   holding to the idea that Tom Ripley killed Dickie, she is brushed aside
   as the angry "widow" (they are not yet married), and all of her
   accusations are dismissed by Dickie's father and the private
   investigator he hired. While the book ends with Ripley happily rich, it
   also suggests that he may forever be dogged by paranoia. In one of the
   final paragraphs, he nervously envisions a group of police officers
   waiting to arrest him, and Highsmith leaves her protagonist wondering,
   "...was he going to see policemen waiting for him on every pier that he
   ever approached?"
