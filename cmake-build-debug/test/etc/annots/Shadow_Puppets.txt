   Peter, Ender's brother, is now Hegemon of Earth. Accepting a tip from
   inside China, where Achilles is held prisoner, Peter had planned for
   Bean to operate the mission, but at the last minute (because he doubted
   Bean would cooperate) assigns Suriyawong, a Battle School student from
   Thailand, to rescue Achilles in transport. Peter believes that he can
   spy on Achilles, take over his network, and then turn Achilles over to
   some country for trial, since Achilles has previously betrayed Russia,
   Pakistan, and India.

   Achilles is known to kill anyone who has seen him vulnerable. Bean and
   his friend Petra, who also served under Ender and who is travelling
   with Bean, have both seen Achilles so and immediately go into hiding,
   preparing for a future confrontation. Bean believes Peter has seriously
   underestimated Achilles, and that he himself is not safe unless he is
   hidden. During their travels, Petra convinces Bean to marry her and
   have children with her by taking him to Anton, the person who Anton's
   Key (Bean's Condition) was named after. Bean is reluctant to have
   children, as he does not want his Anton's Key gene to be passed on. He
   finds Volescu, the original doctor who activated the key in his genes,
   and has him prepare nine embryos through artificial insemination.
   Volescu pretends to identify three embryos with Anton's Key and they
   are discarded. One of the remaining six is implanted into Petra, while
   the rest of them are placed under guard.

   At the same time, a message is passed to Bean that Han Tzu, a comrade
   from Battle School, was not in fact the informant in the message sent
   to Peter about Achilles. Realizing that it had been a setup, Bean gets
   a message to Peter's parents, and they flee with Peter from the
   Hegemon's compound, located in Brazil, which Achilles takes over. Bean
   narrowly escapes an assassination attempt himself, and escapes to
   Damascus. There they find that another Battle School comrade, Alai, is
   the unrivaled Caliph of a nearly unified Muslim world. Meanwhile, Bean
   and Petra's embryos are stolen; Bean expects Achilles to use them to
   bait a trap for them.

   Peter and his parents escape to the colonization platform in space that
   used to be the battle school, relying on the protection of Colonel
   Graff, the former commander of the school, now Minister of
   Colonization. Shortly after they arrive, however, a message is sent
   betraying their presence. Faking their departure from the space
   station, Peter and his parents discover the traitor, one of the
   teachers at battle school. The unmanned shuttle sent as a decoy is shot
   down over Brazil.

   In the previous novel, China had conquered India and Indochina. Alai
   plans to liberate them by invading first China in a feint, and then
   India once China has withdrawn its armies to defend the homeland. His
   invasion is successful, and in the midst of realizing their danger, the
   Chinese government disavows Achilles, providing evidence that he stole
   the missile launcher that destroyed the decoy space shuttle. Left with
   nowhere to turn, Achilles contacts Bean and offers the embryos in
   exchange for safe passage.

   Bean and Peter return to the Hegemon's compound. Achilles expects Bean
   to be so distracted with the idea of retrieving his children that he
   can be killed with a bomb in the embryo transport container. When Bean
   sees through that trap, Achilles offers up fake embryos in petri
   dishes, expecting to lure Bean into a vulnerable position. However,
   Bean sees through the deception. He pulls out a pistol and shoots
   Achilles in the eye. Thus, Achilles is killed in a similar fashion to
   his first victim, Poke, whom he killed with a knife to the eye in
   Ender's Shadow.

   The novel ends with Peter restored as Hegemon, Petra reunited with
   Bean, a Caliph in command of the world's Muslims, a China severely
   reduced in territory and forced to accept humiliating surrender terms,
   and the embryos still lost.
