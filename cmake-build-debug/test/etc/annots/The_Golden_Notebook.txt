   The Golden Notebook is the story of writer Anna Wulf, the four
   notebooks in which she records her life, and her attempt to tie them
   together in a fifth, gold-coloured notebook.

   The book intersperses segments of an ostensibly realistic narrative of
   the lives of Anna and her friend, Molly Jacobs as well as their
   children, ex-husbands and lovers--entitled Free Women--with excerpts
   from Anna's four notebooks, coloured black (of Anna's experience in
   Southern Rhodesia, before and during World War II, which inspired her
   own best-selling novel), red (of her experience as a member of the
   Communist Party), yellow (an ongoing novel that is being written based
   on the painful ending of Anna's own love affair), and blue (Anna's
   personal journal where she records her memories, dreams, and emotional
   life).

   Each notebook is returned to four times, interspersed with episodes
   from Free Women, creating non-chronological, overlapping sections that
   interact with one another. This post-modern styling, with its space for
   "play" engaging the characters and readers, is among the most famous
   features of the book, although Lessing insisted that readers and
   reviewers pay attention to the serious themes in the novel.[citation
