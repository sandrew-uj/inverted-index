   Each volume of the Chronicles of Kylix is set on a different world in
   the magical solar system of the fictional star Kylix in the
   constellation of the Unicorn. The system consists of the five planets
   Zao, Olymbris, Thoorana, Zephrondus and Gulzund. The Quest of Kadji
   takes place on Gulzund.^[2]

   Kadji of the Kozanga Horde, young grandson to the aging warrior Zarouk,
   has been tasked by his grandfather with dethroning Prince Yakthodah,
   usurper of the throne of the Dragon Emperor. To aide him the chiefs
   bestow on him the sacred meteor-forged Axe of Thom-Ra. Crossing the
   Kylix-sun scorched plains on Haral, his faithful black Feridoon pony,
   Kadji rides into the capital to vanquish his nemesis, knowing full well
   this will mean his own painful end. He is accompanied on his quest by
   the magician Akthoob and the red-haired princess Thyra with her wolf
   companion.
