   The Tenth Doctor, Jack, and Martha escape the Futurekind by using
   Jack's vortex manipulator to return to present-day London. They quickly
   learn that the Master has taken on the persona of Harold Saxon, and is
   the newly elected Prime Minister. The Master has created a phone
   network called Archangel which subliminally influenced the population
   to vote for him. The three narrowly avoid a bomb placed in Martha's
   flat and learn that Martha's family has been arrested. The Master
   contacts them to gloat about his seeming victory, and reveals that the
   three are wanted criminals.

   Hiding in an abandoned building, the Doctor uses parts of Martha's
   laptop and his TARDIS keys to create perception filters so they can
   move about unnoticed. He explains some of the Master's past and tells
   them how, as a child, the Master looked into the time vortex and was
   driven mad. They see a TV report that the Master is planning to reveal
   humanity's first contact the next day with an alien race known as the
   Toclafane. UNIT takes over the meeting and moves it to the flying
   aircraft carrier Valiant. The Master accepts the changes and boards the
   Valiant with his wife Lucy. The Doctor, Martha, and Jack teleport
   aboard and discover that the TARDIS has been converted by the Master
   into a Paradox Machine that is building up power to be activated at the
   appointed time of first contact.

   The Doctor, Martha, and Jack enter the bridge of the Valiant as the
   first four Toclafane appear on board. The Master orders the Toclafane
   to kill US President Winters. The Master reveals that he can see around
   the perception filters, and uses his laser screwdriver to kill Jack and
   artificially age the Doctor 100 years using Professor Lazarus's genetic
   manipulation technology and DNA he took from the Doctor's severed hand
   (which Jack took aboard the TARDIS). Jack, having been revived, gives
   Martha his vortex manipulator and tells Martha to get off the Valiant.

   The Master brings Martha's family onto the bridge as the Paradox
   Machine activates. A massive rift opens above the Valiant, allowing six
   billion Toclafane to descend upon Earth and kill one-tenth of the
   Earth's population. Martha tends to the aged Doctor, and he whispers
   into her ear. She uses the vortex manipulator to teleport away, and
   promises to come back.
