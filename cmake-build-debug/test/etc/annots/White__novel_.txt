   The Circle resides in the deserts, able to survive by the aid of Johan
   (formerly Martyn). During a council meeting, the new commander of the
   Horde armies, Woref, orchestrates an invasion on Thomas' tribe. Thomas,
   Suzan, William and the brothers Stephen and Cain ride towards the army,
   leading their capture. Qurong, the Horde leader, takes his prisoners
   before his wife Patricia and daughter Chelise. Qurong announces that
   Chelise is to be wed to Woref. Thomas appeals to Qurong and Chelise's
   desire to learn the Books of Histories, knowing that the Horde cannot
   read them while members of The Circle can. Chelise pleads for Thomas to
   be spared on the basis that it would be more humiliating to be made her
   servant. The group is returned to their tribe and greeted by William,
   who informs them that the Horde has attacked. They have killed ten
   members of the Circle, wounded others, and taken 24 prisoners.

   In Ancient Earth. Thomas has turned Carlos by allowing him to sleep
   while in contact with his blood, where Carlos dreams of the other
   reality as Johan. He decides to join with Thomas in an effort to stop
   Svensson and Fortier from executing their plans: Only releasing the
   antivirus to a small list of people they deemed worthy. America has
   turned its naval fleet, airforce and nuclear arsenal over to the
   French, as a last-ditch effort to resist Thomas and high-ranking U.S.,
   British and Israeli officials order the USS Nimitz to sink the fleet.
   When Thomas returns to Washington D.C., he meets with President Blair,
   Monique and his sister Kara at Genetrix Labs to check on the antivirus
   progress, but the only feasible cure is through his blood. It instantly
   eradicates the virus, and Monique and Kara believe it to be because he
   swam in Elyon's lake and breathed the water in effectively making his
   blood immune. He mounts his horse and rides around them with his sword
   in the sand symbolically carving a circle. He leaves them with the
   Roshuim in pursuit. In the few days since Chelise drowned in the red
   water, 5,000 Scabs followed in pursuit of Elyons gift through Justin.
