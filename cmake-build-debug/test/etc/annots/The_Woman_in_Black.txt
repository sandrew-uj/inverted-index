   The novel is narrated by Arthur Kipps, the young lawyer who formerly
   worked for Mr. Bentley. One Christmas Eve he is at home with his wife
   Esme and four stepchildren, who are sharing ghost stories. When he is
   asked to tell a story, he becomes irritated and leaves the room, and
   decides to write of his horrific experiences several years in the past
   in the hopes that doing so will exorcise them from his memory.

   Many years earlier, whilst still a junior solicitor for Bentley, Kipps
   is summoned to Crythin Gifford, a small market town on the north east
   coast of England, to attend the funeral of Mrs. Alice Drablow and
   settle her estate. Kipps is reluctant to leave his fiancee, Stella, but
   eager to get away from the dreary London fog. The late Mrs. Drablow was
   an elderly and reclusive widow who lived alone in the desolate and
   secluded Eel Marsh House.

   The house is situated on Nine Lives Causeway. At high tide, it is
   completely cut off from the mainland, surrounded only by marshes and
   sea frets. Kipps soon realises that there is more to Alice Drablow than
   he originally thought. At the funeral, he sees a woman dressed in black
   and with a pale face and dark eyes, whom a group of children are
   silently watching. While sorting through Mrs. Drablow's papers at Eel
   Marsh House over the course of several days, he endures an increasingly
   terrifying sequence of unexplained noises, chilling events and
   appearances by the Woman in Black. In one of these instances, he hears
   the sound of a horse and carriage in distress, closely followed by the
   screams of a young child and his maid, coming from the direction of the
   marshes.

   Most of the people in Crythin Gifford are reluctant to reveal
   information about Mrs. Drablow and the mysterious woman in black. Any
   attempt by Kipps to find out the truth causes pained and fearful
   reactions. From various sources, he learns that Mrs. Drablow's sister,
   Jennet Humfrye, gave birth to a child, Nathaniel. Because she was
   unmarried, she was forced to give the child to her sister. Mrs. Drablow
   and her husband adopted the boy, and insisted that he should never know
   that Jennet was his mother. The child's screams that Kipps heard were
   those of Nathaniel's ghost. Jennet went away for a year. When realising
   she could not be parted for long from her son, she made an agreement to
   stay at Eel Marsh House with him as long as she never revealed her true
   identity to him. She secretly planned to abscond from the house with
   her son. One day, a pony and trap carrying the boy across the causeway
   became lost and sank into the marshes, killing all aboard, while Jennet
   looked on helplessly from the window.

   After Jennet died, she returned to haunt Eel Marsh House and the town
   of Crythin Gifford, as the malevolent Woman in Black. According to
   local tales, a sighting of the Woman in Black presaged the death of a
   child.

   After some time (but still years before the beginning of the story),
   Kipps returns to London, marries Stella, has a child of his own, and
   tries to put the events at Crythin Gifford behind him. At a fair, while
   his wife and child are enjoying a pony and trap ride, Kipps sees the
   Woman in Black. She steps out in front of the horse and startles it,
   causing it to bolt and wreck the carriage against a tree, killing the
   child instantly and critically injuring Stella, who dies ten months
   later.

   Kipps finishes his reminiscence with the words, "They have asked for my
   story. I have told it. Enough."
