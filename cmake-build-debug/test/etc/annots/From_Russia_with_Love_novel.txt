   Not that it matters, but a great deal of the background to this story
   is accurate. ... SMERSH, a contraction of Smiert Spionam--Death to
   Spies--exists and remains today the most secret department of the
   Soviet government.

   Ian Fleming, From Russia, with Love, Author's note

   SMERSH, the Soviet counterintelligence agency, plans to commit a grand
   act of terrorism in the intelligence field. For this, it targets the
   British secret service agent James Bond. Due in part to his role in the
   defeat of the SMERSH agents Le Chiffre, Mr Big and Hugo Drax, Bond has
   been listed as an enemy of the Soviet state and a "death warrant" is
   issued for him. His death is planned to precipitate a major sex
   scandal, which will run in the world press for months and leave his and
   his service's reputations in tatters. Bond's killer is to be the SMERSH
   executioner Donovan "Red" Grant, a British Army deserter and psychopath
   whose homicidal urges coincide with the full moon. Kronsteen, SMERSH's
   chess-playing master planner, and Colonel Rosa Klebb, the head of
   Operations and Executions, devise the operation. They instruct an
   attractive young cipher clerk, Corporal Tatiana Romanova, to falsely
   defect from her post in Istanbul and claim to have fallen in love with
   Bond after seeing a photograph of him. As an added lure for Bond,
   Romanova will provide the British with a Spektor, a Russian decoding
   device much coveted by MI6. She is not told the details of the plan.
   The Orient Express, on which Bond travelled from Istanbul to Paris

   The offer of defection is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from
   Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects her and the Spektor
   from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the
   Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, M, orders him to go
   to Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head
   of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and
   they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim
   believe her story and the three board the Orient Express. Kerim quickly
   discovers three Russian MGB agents on board, travelling incognito. He
   uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but
   he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third
   MGB agent.

   At Trieste a man introduces himself as Captain Nash, a fellow MI6
   agent, and Bond presumes he has been sent by M as added protection for
   the rest of the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond
   reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at
   which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Nash later wakes Bond,
   holding him at gunpoint, and reveals himself as the killer Grant.
   Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is
   to shoot both of them, throw Romanova's body out the window, and plant
   a film of their love-making in her luggage; in addition, the Spektor is
   booby-trapped to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his
   metal cigarette case between the pages of a book he holds in front of
   him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After
   Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over
   him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.

   Later, in Paris, after successfully delivering Romanova and the
   booby-trapped Spektor to his superiors, Bond meets Rosa Klebb. She is
   captured but manages to kick Bond with a poisoned blade concealed in
   her shoe; the story ends with Bond fighting for breath and falling to
   the floor.
