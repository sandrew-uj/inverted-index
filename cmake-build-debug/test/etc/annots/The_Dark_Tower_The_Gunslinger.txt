   The book tells the story of The Gunslinger, Roland of Gilead, and his
   quest to catch the man in black, the first of many steps toward
   Roland's ultimate destination, The Dark Tower.

   The main story takes place in a world somewhat similar to the Old West
   but in an alternate timeframe or parallel universe. Roland exists in a
   place in which "the world has moved on." This world has a few things in
   common with our own, however, including memories of the old song "Hey
   Jude" and the child's rhyme that begins "Beans, Beans, the Musical
   Fruit", as well as the existence of hamburgers and beer. Vestiges of
   forgotten or skewed versions of real-world technology also appear, such
   as a reference to a gas pump that is worshipped as a god named "Amoco"
   and an abandoned way station with a water pump powered by an "atomic
   slug."
