   Narrated from the first-person perspective of John Moore, a crime
   reporter for The New York Times, the novel begins on January 8, 1919,
   the day that Theodore Roosevelt is buried. Moore has dinner with Laszlo
   Kreizler, the famous alienist. Kreizler is surrounded by those he has
   rescued, including his black servant, Cyrus Montrose, and a boy named
   Stevie "Stevepipe" Taggert. (Mary Palmer, another patient and
   Kreizler's housekeeper, is deceased by the time of this dinner.)
   Together, they reminisce about their times with Roosevelt, but they
   focus on one moment: the spring of 1896 and their efforts to catch a
   serial killer on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The novel is
   narrated in retrospect, with Moore commenting on the events and how
   they impacted later history.

   At 2 AM on March 3, 1896, Moore is awakened by one of Kreizler's
   servants banging incessantly on his door. Stevie, a young boy whom
   Kreizler had saved from being institutionalized and who is dedicated to
   Kreizler, brings Moore to the scene of a crime that Kreizler wants
   Moore to see. Roosevelt, the police commissioner, is already at the
   scene. When Moore sees the nature of the brutal murder, he is appalled.
   The victim, Georgio "Gloria" Santorelli, is a 13-year-old boy who
   prostituted himself by dressing up as a girl; the boy's wrists are tied
   behind his back, and he is kneeling with his face pressed on the steel
   walkway where he was found. Though makeup paint and powder on his face
   are still intact, his eyes are gouged out, his right hand is chopped
   off, his genitals are cut off and stuffed between his jaws, he has huge
   gashes across his entire body, his throat has been slashed, and his
   buttocks are "shorn off". The policeman at the scene, Detective
   Sergeant Connor, makes it clear that murders of such victims are
   usually ignored.
   "Prior to the twentieth century, persons suffering from mental illness
   were thought to be 'alienated,' not only from the rest of society but
   from their own true natures. Those experts who studied mental
   pathologies were known as 'alienists'."

    --"Note" at the beginning of the novel

   At Roosevelt's request, Moore, Kreizler, and he meet the following
   morning in Roosevelt's office to discuss the case. Kreizler has
   examined the body and disagrees with the official coroner's report. He
   connects the Santorelli killing to that of a second case in which two
   children, Benjamin and Sofia Zweig, were killed and had their eyes
   gouged out. Roosevelt announces that there are two more murders that
   match the pattern. Roosevelt decides to investigate, but because
   Kreizler has such a dubious reputation as an alienist, and because the
   investigation will become politically difficult, he establishes a base
   of operations for them outside the police precinct. Politically,
   Roosevelt cannot afford to be associated with the investigation and is
   not involved with the day-to-day operations.

   Kreizler asks for some young detectives who are open to new methods and
   receives the help of Sara Howard, the first woman to be hired by the
   police department, and Marcus and Lucius Isaacson, two Jewish brothers
   who were hired when Roosevelt began removing corrupt police officers
   from the force. The Isaacsons bring sophisticated methods, such as the
   Bertillon system and fingerprinting, to the investigation, although
   these were not popular in New York City police departments at the time
   nor accepted in courts of law.

   The group begins to investigate the victims, hoping to understand the
   mind of the murderer by understanding his victims. They interview
   Georgio Santorelli's mother and discover, for example, that there was
   discord in his family. Georgio's parents had learned of his being
   manipulated into performing sexual acts for older boys in school, and
   the father's response was to try to beat it out of the boy. Georgio
   eventually left home and lived on the streets as a male-for-male
   prostitute. They also read the emerging science of psychology, such as
   the works of William James. Another body is discovered, and the
   evidence suggests that the victim knew his attacker. The team also
   deduces that the killer's agility on rooftops suggests that he is
   familiar with mountain- or rock-climbing.

   Kreizler, Roosevelt, Moore, and Howard must deal with various interest
   groups during their investigation who wish to maintain society's status
   quo, including a corrupt police force, which takes bribes from owners
   of the brothels whose prostitutes include poor immigrants; the Catholic
   Church, which is wary of the potential power of an organized immigrant
   population; the Episcopal Church; and J. P. Morgan.
