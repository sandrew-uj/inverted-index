   The novel is set in a near-future dystopia in which most people must
   live in gated communities or in armed nomadic groups called "car
   families." The novel traces the experiences of Blake Maslin, a
   physician living in Southern California, and his sixteen-year-old twin
   daughters, Rane and Keira. Traveling across a Mojave desert, the three
   are kidnapped by Eli Doyle, the only survivor of Clay's Ark, a
   spaceship that made an emergency crash landing in the desert on its
   return from the first manned mission to another planet. Eli is infected
   with an alien microorganism that gives him heightened sensory and
   physical powers, but also directs his actions toward its own survival
   and transmission. He has assembled a "family" on a small isolated
   ranch, hoping to slow or stop the microorganism's transmission, but the
   urge to reproduce is so strong that he seeks out other humans to add to
   his family. Many infected young men or older women die of the disease,
   but infected women survive to give birth to sphinx-like
   offspring--intelligent quadrupeds with extraordinary speed. The
   mutants, eventually (in novels set later in the series) called
   clayarks, see uninfected humans as food but can also spread the
   microorganism through their bite. Blake, Rane, and Keira are infected
   and Eli expects them to join in the reproductive project of the
   community. Blake and his daughters flee, only to be captured by a "car
   family" with much more violent tendencies. Blake and Rane, drawn by the
   microorganism to seek out food and sex, are fatally injured by the "car
   family." Rane is decapitated, but Blake manages to escape long enough
   to infect a long-haul truck driver, making inevitable the spread of the
   disease through the rest of the country and eventually the world.
   Keira, having been cured of leukemia by the microorganism, reluctantly
   agrees to participate and returns with Eli to the ranch family,
   pregnant with her own mutant child.
