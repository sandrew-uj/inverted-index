   The Alien franchise depicts a series of deadly encounters,
   predominantly spanning the 21st and 24th centuries, between humanity
   and the Aliens; a hostile, endoparasitoid, extraterrestrial
   species. Humanity is depicted as a space-faring species with an
   interstellar dominion; space journeys typically last months, even
   years, and require the use of cryosleep. Throughout the series,
   characters are repeatedly manipulated and endangered by the
   unscrupulous megacorporation Weyland-Yutani Corp, which seeks to profit
   from the Aliens.

   The series fictionalizes the origin of the human race. A member of an
   ancient humanoid species, called the "Engineers", sacrifices himself,
   allowing his DNA to spark the genesis of mankind. The Engineers' other
   experiments, designed to exterminate the human race through the means
   of a deadly mutagen, paves the way for the Aliens to rise and populate
   through the traumatic implantation of larvae in hosts.
   Incidents across several generations are chronicled throughout the
   franchise.
