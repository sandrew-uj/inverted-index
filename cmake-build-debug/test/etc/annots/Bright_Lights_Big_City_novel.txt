   The story's narrator is a 24-year-old writer who works as a fact
   checker for a highbrow magazine for which he had once hoped to write.
   By night, he is a cocaine-using party-goer seeking to lose himself in
   the hedonism of the 1980s yuppie party scene, often going to a
   nightclub called Heartbreak.

   His wife, Amanda, recently left him, and he copes with this by
   pretending nothing happened and telling no one that she is gone. The
   two had met in Kansas City; the narrator moves with her to New York
   City, where she begins a modeling career that quickly takes off. After
   flying out to Paris for Fashion Week, she calls the narrator to inform
   him that she is leaving him for another man and to pursue her career.
   Initially hopeful that she will return someday, the narrator eventually
   resorts to searching for her at a fashion event, publicly humiliating
   himself while failing to garner more attention from her than a brief
   look. He obsesses over every item she owned in his apartment, every
   modeling photo and every club she visited, even repeatedly visiting a
   mannequin based on her. His partying and his personal troubles begin to
   affect his work. He eventually comes to realize Amanda's
   superficiality, becoming both disillusioned with her and the
   materialistic culture of New York in general. He reveals that the true
   reason for his spiral downwards was his mother's death, which actually
   took place a year ago. He realizes that he had married Amanda because
   he thought it would make his mother happy. After his mother's death, he
   was in shock and it wasn't until Amanda left him that he began really
   grieving over his mother, causing his cocaine addiction and reckless
   abandon.
