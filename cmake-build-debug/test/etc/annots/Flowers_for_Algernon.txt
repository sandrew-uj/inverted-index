   The short story and the novel share many similar plot points, but the
   novel expands significantly on Charlie's developing emotional state as
   well as his intelligence, his memories of childhood, and the
   relationship with his family. Both are presented as a series of journal
   entries ("progress reports") written by the protagonist, Charlie
   Gordon. The style, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of these reports
   reflect changes in his mental and emotional growth.
