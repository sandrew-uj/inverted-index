   The novel is in the first person, fictionally written by the character
   McIlvaine some thirty or forty years after the events.

   The setting of the novel is New York in 1871. Martin Pemberton is a
   freelance journalist. His father, Augustus Pemberton, is recently
   deceased. Augustus had disinherited Martin several years earlier after
   Martin expressed disapproval of the unscrupulous business methods by
   which Augustus had accumulated a large fortune. After his father's
   death, Martin sees his father, briefly and accidentally, in a
   horse-drawn "omnibus" belonging to the municipal transportation company
   as it drives past him in a crowded street. The passengers, including
   his father, are all elderly well-dressed men.

   Martin tells four people of the sighting: his editor, McIlvaine; his
   fiancee, Emily Tisdale; the family pastor, Dr. Grimshaw; and a college
   friend, Harry Wheelwright. When Martin disappears soon afterward,
   McIlvaine begins looking for him and talks to all four. He also talks
   to Augustus's widow (and Martin's stepmother), Sarah Pemberton, who has
   always liked Martin and is deeply concerned about him. From
   Wheelwright, McIlvaine learns that he and Martin secretly opened
   Augustus's grave and found a child buried there instead of the old man.
   From Sarah, McIlvaine learns that Augustus was diagnosed with a
   terminal blood disease and that with the assistance of his secretary,
   Eustace Simmons, he entered a private hospital said to be near Saranac
   Lake in upstate New York and run by a Dr. Sartorius. There, she was
   told, Augustus died. Sarah also reveals that Augustus's wealth seems to
   have vanished shortly before his death, leaving Sarah and her young
   son, Martin's half-brother Noah, penniless.

   McIlvaine approaches an old acquaintance, police captain Edmund Donne,
   for help. Donne, McIlvaine soon finds out, has a personal interest in
   the case - he had courted Augustus's widow Sarah many years earlier,
   before her marriage to Augustus. Their investigation finds no trace of
   the hospital in which Augustus supposedly died. Instead, it takes them
   to The Home for Little Wanderers, a well-funded private orphanage run
   by Eustace Simmons. They discover Martin locked in the basement,
   catatonic and almost dead of starvation.

   When Martin is at last well enough to talk, he reveals what he
   discovered after being kidnapped and imprisoned by Simmons to stop him
   from asking questions about Augustus. Augustus Pemberton had faked his
   death. Along with other wealthy old men of the city, each of whom was
   terminally ill, Augustus is being kept alive by Dr. Sartorius.
   Sartorius, a brilliant and innovative Army surgeon during the Civil
   War, has invented treatments that were then unknown to medicine: blood
   transfusions, dialysis, bone marrow transplants and others. His dark
   secret is that young children must be sacrificed for their blood and
   somatic cells. Dr. Sartorius considers himself innocent of their actual
   deaths, as each child "died from fright" and not from his nefarious
   medical attention. With the assistance of the corrupt Tweed Ring, which
   runs New York (and with which several of the old men are connected),
   Sartorius has built a secret sanitarium in which he is free to
   experiment and administer his treatments without any supervision.

   When Donne discovers the location of the sanitarium in a municipal
   waterworks installation outside the city, he stages a police raid. The
   Tweed Ring is in the process of being destroyed by a corruption
   investigation and is no longer able to protect Sartorius and his
   establishment. Sartorius is arrested; his patients are found dead
   except for Augustus, who is missing. Sartorius is brought to the insane
   asylum on Blackwell's Island, where he claims to be continuing his
   research. Augustus, who was removed from the sanitarium by Simmons
   before the raid, is found dead at his old home. Simmons is also found
   dead, killed in an accident while trying to flee with part of
   Augustus's fortune. The money is turned over to Sarah, as Augustus's
   widow. Sarah and Donne are soon married. Martin, now recovered, marries
   his fiancee, Emily. McIlvaine resumes his career as an editor, but
   never publishes the story of his investigation.
