     "The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had
     hesitated too long."

   -- The first sentence of Last Night in Twisted River.

   The novel opens in 1954 in the small logging settlement of Twisted
   River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log
   driving accident on the river has just claimed the life of a young
   logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo
   is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with
   his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years
   previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend,
   Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie
   went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of
   Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and
   girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an
   affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his
   father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic
   takes Jane's body and deposits it on the kitchen floor of Carl's house,
   knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he
   killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and
   Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the
   bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.

   Dominic and Daniel head for a restaurant in the Italian North End of
   Boston to tell Angel's mother of her son's death. Dominic gets a job as
   a cook in the restaurant and changes his surname to Del Popolo (Angel's
   mother's surname) to hide from Carl. During this time Daniel attends
   Exeter, a private school in southern New Hampshire, followed by the
   University of New Hampshire. While at university Daniel starts writing
   his first novel. He also meets Katie Callahan, a radical art student,
   whom he agrees to marry. Katie has one mission in life: to make
   potential Vietnam War draftees fathers, thus enabling them to apply for
   paternity deferment. Daniel and Katie have a son Joe, but when Joe
   is 2, Katie leaves Daniel to find another young man to rescue from the
   war. Daniel moves to Iowa with Joe, where he enrolls in the Iowa
   Writers' Workshop. He also changes his name to Danny Angel to hide from
   Carl, and uses this nom de plume to publish his novels. After
   graduating from the Writers' Workshop in 1967, Danny and Joe move to
   Putney, Vermont.

                            Danny Angel's novels

    1. Family Life in Coos County (c. 1967)
    2. The Mickey (1972)
    3. Kissing Kin (1975)
    4. Kennedy Fathers (1978)
    5. The Spinster; or, The Maiden Aunt (1981)
    6. East of Bangor (1984)
    7. Baby in the Road (1995)
    8. In the After-Hours Restaurant (2002)

   Ketchum keeps in touch with both Dominic and Danny via telephone and
   letters, and warns them that Carl is looking for them. On Ketchum's
   advice, Dominic leaves Boston to join Danny in Vermont. He changes his
   name to Tony Angel, father of the writer Danny Angel. While Danny
   teaches writing at Windham College, Tony opens and runs his own
   restaurant. After the publication of his fourth and most successful
   novel, Kennedy Fathers (based on Katie), Danny stops teaching and
   focuses on writing. Then in 1983, two of the sawmill's wives in Twisted
   River are passing through Vermont and stop for a meal at Tony's
   restaurant. They recognize Tony and later tell Carl where "Cookie" is.
   Again, on Ketchum's advice, the father and son are forced to flee, this
   time to Toronto, Ontario.

   With their cover blown, Tony and Danny revert to their original names.
   Dominic finds another restaurant to work in, while Danny continues
   writing, still under his pseudonym. Joe remains in the United States
   while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Danny meets a Canadian
   screenwriter named Charlotte Turner, who is writing the screenplay of
   Danny's abortion novel East of Bangor. They decide to marry, but only
   after Joe graduates. When Joe dies in a car accident in 1987, Danny
   decides he cannot face the possibility of ever losing another child,
   and he and Charlotte part ways. He retains the right to a lonely cabin
   on an island in Georgian Bay at Pointe au Baril, owned by Charlotte,
   which he uses for his writing.

   In 2001, Ketchum gets careless and unwittingly leads Carl to Dominic
   and Danny's house in Toronto. Carl shoots and kills Dominic and Danny
   retaliates by shooting and killing Carl. Ketchum is devastated at
   having failed to protect his friends and takes his own life at Twisted
   River. Danny, who has now lost his mother, father, son and their
   friend, tries to focus on writing his next book, a follow-up to his
   previous eight semi-autobiographical novels. Then his last hope, Amy
   ("Lady Sky"), arrives on his doorstep. When Joe was 2, Amy had
   parachuted naked onto a pig farm Danny and Joe were visiting. Danny
   rescued Amy from the pig pen and Joe, awe-struck by this event, called
   her "Lady Sky". Amy in turn offered to help Danny whenever he needed
   it. Having read all about the famous writer and his misfortunes, Amy
   tracks Danny down and moves in with him. Happy now, Danny finds the
   opening sentence of his new book: "The young Canadian, who could not
   have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long."
