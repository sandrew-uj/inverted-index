   The novel's protagonist, Joan Foster, is a romance novelist who has
   spent her life running away from difficult situations. The novel
   alternates between flashbacks from the past and scenes from the
   present. Through flashbacks, the reader sees her first as an overweight
   child whose mother constantly criticizes her, and later, hiding her
   career, her past as the mistress of a Polish count, and her affair with
   a performance artist called The Royal Porcupine, from her bipolar
   husband Arthur.

   In the present, she has recently published a volume of feminist poetry
   which becomes a breakthrough success and is overwhelmed by the
   pressures of sudden fame. Joan panics after receiving a blackmail
   attempt from someone who has found out about her secrets. With the help
   of two acquaintances, she fakes her own death and then flees to
   Italy.
