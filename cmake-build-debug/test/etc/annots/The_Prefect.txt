   The novel begins with Dreyfus being sent out on a routine assignment to
   lock down a glitter-band habitat for polling violations. His superiors
   send one of his deputies, Thalia Ng, to distribute software upgrades
   around the Glitter Band to prevent anyone from attempting a similar
   violation.

   In the meantime, Dreyfus is sent to investigate the recent destruction
   of a habitat named Ruskin-Sartorious. Analysis indicates that the
   habitat has been destroyed by the flame of a Conjoiner Drive, and
   Dreyfus's team believe the lighthugger Accompaniment of Shadows, the
   only one to have been near the habitat in recent weeks, is responsible.
   Before they can conclude their investigation, however, the Ultranauts
   take justice into their own hands and destroy the ship, but not before
   Dreyfus is able to converse with the captain, who convinces him that
   his crew were not responsible. Believing him to be truthful, Dreyfus
   and his deputy, the hyperpig Sparver, decide to investigate the matter
   further.

   Dreyfus and Sparver interview digital backups of the inhabitants of
   Ruskin-Sartorious. Dreyfus speaks with one of them about the
   Clockmaker, an alien machine which formerly lived in a Glitter Band
   research centre, creating, as its name suggests, clocks, before it
   began a violent killing spree and was destroyed with nuclear weapons
   nine years prior to the novel. He and Sparver then analyse
   communication records from the Ruskin-Sartorious habitat, and discover
   links with an orbiting asteroid owned by the Nerval-Lermontov family (a
   member of which was called Aurora). They defeat its defence systems and
   penetrate inside, discovering a Conjoiner starship trapped inside. One
   of them, Clepsydra, has escaped and is hiding. She meets with Dreyfus
   and tells him that she and the other Conjoiners had been enslaved by
   Aurora (now an extremely powerful software entity) to use the Exordium
   to predict the future. The Conjoiners predict a future devastated by
   what is implied to be the Melding Plague, and Aurora has been planning
   to respond to stop it (use of the Exordium creates a new timeline which
   can be changed to avoid the future the Exordium describes). She and
   Dreyfus escape as a ship under Aurora's control arrives and destroys
   the habitat.

   At the same time, Thalia has distributed the software upgrade to the
   required four habitats across the Glitter Band, but it appears to be
   malfunctioning; information access is shut down in the habitats she has
   visited, and servitors (service robots used across the Glitter Band)
   are rounding up and exterminating civilians. She and some of the
   survivors of the last habitat take refuge in its polling core tower,
   barricading the entrance. Outside, the servitors begin to construct
   "weevil" war machines using plans stolen by Gaffney, a Senior Prefect
   secretly in alliance with Aurora.

   Back at Panoply, with Dreyfus in the field and out of communication,
   Gaffney manipulates the Senior Prefects into voting Aumonier out of
   office. Clepsydra is taken into isolation, whilst Dreyfus explains the
   situation to the Senior Prefects. Unbeknownst to him, however, Gaffney
   kills Clepsydra and frames Dreyfus. The Prefects debate what to do
   about the emergence of the weevils, which have now left the four
   original habitats and are moving towards others.

   Before very long, however, Gaffney is exposed as the murderer of
   Clepsydra when attempting to interrogate Dreyfus. He admits to his role
   in the weevil outbreak and informs the Prefects that Aurora is
   responsible. Aurora herself contacts Panoply and demands that they
   stand down, claiming to be taking over the Glitter Band for its own
   good. Aumonier, now back in power, refuses and orders Panoply to ready
   for war. Although Thalia escapes from Aurora's forces during a
   disastrous attack by Panoply, simulations run by the Prefects indicate
   that they have virtually no chance of success; the weevils are
   destroying habitats and converting them into even more weevils, grossly
   outnumbering the Prefects.

   Aumonier speaks to Dreyfus and tells him that the aforementioned
   Clockmaker was not actually destroyed nine years previously; part of it
   survived and was recovered by Panoply. The ultra-secret Panoply unit,
   Firebrand, was established to research it. Although Aumonier ordered it
   shut down, she now believes its members relocated the Clockmaker to
   Ruskin-Sartorious. As the Clockmaker was the only intelligence in the
   Glitter Band capable of defeating Aurora, she attempted to destroy it.
   Dreyfus confronts members of Firebrand, who confirm Aumonier's theory,
   but reveal that the Clockmaker was not in fact destroyed; Firebrand
   became aware of the attack in advance and moved the Clockmaker.
   Following them to the surface of Yellowstone, he and Sparver fight
   their way into an abandoned Amerikano colony, where the Clockmaker is
   being hidden. Sparver leaves to fight Gaffney, who is approaching the
   colony with bombs to destroy the Clockmaker.

   Dreyfus meets with the Clockmaker, who reveals that he is actually
   Philip Lascaille, a character in Revelation Space who was believed to
   have committed suicide after meeting with the Shrouders, but was in
   fact scanned to produce a simulation, which was sent back to the
   Shrouders, who turned it into the Clockmaker. Dreyfus tells the
   Clockmaker what is happening. It incapacitates him and leaves.
   Regaining consciousness, Dreyfus meets with Sparver. They return to
   Panoply to find that the weevil attack has collapsed; the Clockmaker
   has uploaded itself into the Glitter Band's data network and is
   fighting a digital war with Aurora. As such, she is unable to control
   the weevils effectively, and the Prefects are destroying them in
   alliance with the Ultras. Dreyfus begins preparing to investigate the
   death of Philip Lascaille, having promised the Clockmaker he would
   bring those responsible to justice.
