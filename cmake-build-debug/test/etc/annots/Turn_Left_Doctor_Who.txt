   Donna gets a free reading from a fortune teller who helps her recall
   the event that led to her meeting the Tenth Doctor. Donna
   remembers when she was at an intersection looking for a new job; Donna
   wanted to turn left to get a well-paid temp position, while her mother
   Sylvia wanted her to turn right as to take a permanent job as a PA.
   Donna ultimately turned left. The fortune teller makes Donna choose
   again and forces her to turn right. As she makes this new choice, a
   large beetle working for the Trickster attaches itself to her back and
   she loses consciousness.

   Donna's decision creates an alternative reality in which she never met
   the Doctor after turning right and, as a result of the consequent
   butterfly effect, the Doctor drowns in the flood killing the Racnoss
   children, making him unable to intervene in several other events
   affecting contemporary Earth. Changes include the Doctor's former
   companion Sarah Jane Smith, her son Luke Smith, Maria Jackson and Clyde
   Langer perishing while stepping in to try and stop the Plasmavore and
   the Judoon in Royal Hope Hospital on the Moon in the Doctor's absence.
   Martha Jones suffocated after giving up her oxygen to
   classmate/co-worker Oliver Morgenstern while on the Moon. Captain
   Jack Harkness and his Torchwood teammates Gwen Cooper and Ianto Jones
   are also lost whilst also stepping in for the Doctor and fighting the
   Sontarans in "The Sontaran Stratagem" in the main timeline. The
   space-going Titanic crashes into Buckingham Palace, killing millions of
   London's residents in the resulting nuclear explosion from the reactors
   on the Titanic going critical. The UK is placed under martial law
   and the government transfers all non-British citizens into internment
   camps.

   Rose Tyler mysteriously appears to Donna and gives Donna advice which
   saves her and her family from the destruction of London, but they are
   forcibly displaced. Later, after noticing the stars are disappearing
   from the sky, Donna is convinced to come with Rose. Rose explains that
   the stars are going out in every universe and that the fabric of
   reality is collapsing, allowing Rose to travel between universes. Rose
   insists that the Doctor is the only one who can stop it.

   Donna is transported back in time minutes before she would turn right,
   but is too far away to contact her past self in time. She walks in
   front of a passing truck which hits her, creating a traffic jam along
   the right-hand turning, causing her impatient past self to turn left
   instead. As Donna lies dying on the ground, Rose whispers a message for
   the Doctor into her ear. The alternative universe disintegrates, and
   Donna wakes up. The beetle falls off Donna's back and dies and the
   terrified fortune teller runs away. Donna recalls Rose's message was
   the words: "Bad Wolf". The Doctor and Donna then find the words "Bad
   Wolf" written everywhere. The Doctor rushes into the TARDIS and,
   hearing the cloister bell, announces that the universe is about to end.
