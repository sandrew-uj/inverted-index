   The story begins sometime in the 29th century on the planet Wilson
   (orbiting Arcturus) with a young man named Giraut and his romantic,
   swashbuckling friends, who are all members of the Nou Occitan culture
   and residents in the Quartier de Jovents, a sort of playground for
   teens and twenty-somethings who have not yet moved on to the more
   "grown-up" lifestyle of their parents. Technologically safeguarded,
   these young adults have swordfights in the streets with "neuroducer"
   epees and frequent the taverns of the Quartier, living in an
   imaginative recreation of Occitan literature and the trobador
   tradition.

   However, Giraut is forced to grow up much more quickly than most of his
   friends, because one day his friend Aimeric, who was, before coming to
   Wilson and becoming a jovent, an economist in the Caledon culture of
   the nearest inhabited planet, Nansen (orbiting Mufrid), is called upon
   by the government to return to his home planet on a mission to regulate
   the effects of the springer on Caledonian economy. The springer is a
   method of instantaneous transportation which is quickly reuniting
   humanity across known space.

   Giraut decides to leave when he catches his girlfriend getting into the
   Interstellar "arts scene" (the art is called "sadoporn") which is an
   acting out against the exclusive values and code of honor valued by
   Giraut and his friends. Thus, Aimeric and Giraut advise the rational
   council of the Caledonians to adjust their economy to that of the rest
   of the universe so that the springer will have as few adverse effects
   as possible.

   When the Caledonians decide that Aimeric and Giraut, as well as the
   Interstellar government, are trying to usurp their power, they begin to
   try to seize back control of everything, and an urban conflict ensues.
   Giraut discovers among the strife who he really is and begins to see
   how fake his life back home was, and recognize faults in his home
   culture.
