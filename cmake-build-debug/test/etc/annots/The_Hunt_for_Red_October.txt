   During the Cold War, Marko Ramius, a Soviet Navy submarine commander
   plans to defect to the United States with the Typhoon-class ballistic
   missile submarine Red October. It is equipped with a cutting-edge
   silent propulsion system, known as the "caterpillar drive," that makes
   audio detection by passive sonar extremely difficult and enables the
   submarine to sneak its way into American territorial waters and launch
   nuclear missiles with little to no warning. As the sub leaves the
   shipyard at Polyarny, Ramius kills his political officer, Ivan Putin,
   to ensure that he will not interfere. Ramius was ordered to conduct
   military exercises with Soviet Alfa-class attack submarine V. K.
   Konovalov, commanded by his former student Viktor Tupolev, in order to
   test the effectiveness of the caterpillar drive. Instead, he plots a
   course for the North American coast, falsely informing the crew that
   they will be proceeding undetected all the way to Cuba. Before sailing,
   Ramius sends a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin brazenly stating his
   intention to defect; the Soviet Northern Fleet then sails out to sink
   Red October under the pretext of a search and rescue mission.

   Coincidentally, Red October passes near USS Dallas, a Los Angeles-class
   submarine under the command of Bart Mancuso, which is patrolling the
   entrance of a route used by Soviet submarines in the Reykjanes Ridge
   off Iceland. Dallas's sonar operator hears the sound of the stealth
   drive but does not immediately identify it as a submarine. As tensions
   rise between the U.S. and Soviet fleets due to the unannounced
   incursion of the Soviet Northern Fleet into Atlantic waters, the crew
   of the Dallas analyzes tapes of Red October's acoustic signature and
   realizes that it is the sound of a new propulsion system. Meanwhile,
   CIA analyst Jack Ryan finds out that the submarine's new construction
   variations house its stealth drive.

   Later putting information about Ramius's letter together with the
   subsequent launch of the entire Northern Fleet, Ryan deduces Ramius's
   plans to defect. The U.S. military reluctantly agrees to assist, while
   planning for contingencies in case the Soviet fleet has intentions
   other than those inferred. After it is revealed that Ramius has
   informed Moscow of his plan for him and his officers to defect, Ryan
   becomes responsible for shepherding Ramius and his submarine away from
   the pursuing Soviet fleet and meets with Royal Navy acquaintance
   Admiral John White, commanding a task force from the aircraft carrier
   HMS Invincible.

   After Ramius fakes a reactor accident, the U.S. Navy evacuates Red
   October's crew using a DSRV rescue submarine. Ramius and his officers
   stay behind, claiming that they plan to scuttle the submarine to
   prevent it getting into the hands of the Americans. In order to
   convince the Soviets that Red October has in fact been destroyed, a
   decommissioned U.S. ballistic missile submarine, USS Ethan Allen, is
   blown up underwater as a deception. A depth gauge taken from the main
   instrument panel of Red October is made to appear as if it had been
   salvaged from the Ethan Allen's wreckage. Meanwhile, Ryan, Mancuso,
   some of the Dallas crew, and Owen Williams board Red October and meet
   Ramius face-to-face.

   The deception succeeds in convincing Soviet observers that Red October
   has been lost and the Soviet forces withdraw, but Tupolev stays behind.
   Unbeknownst to anyone, Igor Loginov, a cook on Red October who is
   actually an undercover GRU intelligence officer, has remained aboard
   after the other crewmen evacuated. He attempts to destroy Red October
   by manually launching one of the submarine's missiles in its silo.
   Loginov is discovered and fatally shoots Captain Lieutenant Kamarov and
   seriously wounds Ramius and Williams. Ryan tries to reason with the GRU
   agent, who refuses to listen and is eventually killed in a firefight in
   the submarine's missile compartment.

   Later, the V.K. Konovalov happens upon what is initially believed to be
   an Ohio-class submarine, being escorted by two other submarines. Based
   on its acoustical signature, Tupolev realizes that it is in fact Red
   October, and proceeds to engage it. The two U.S. submarines escorting
   Red October are prohibited from firing on the Konovalov by rules of
   engagement, and Red October has no torpedomen on board. After a tense
   battle, Ramius manages to sink the Konovalov by ramming it, killing
   Tupolev and his crew.

   The Americans escort Red October safely into dry dock in Norfolk,
   Virginia, where it is analyzed by U.S. military intelligence. Ramius
   and his crew are taken to a CIA safehouse where they are given new
   identities, beginning their settlement into American life. Ryan is
   commended and debriefed by his superiors; he later flies back to his
   posting in London.
