   The story is written from two viewpoints, equidistant from the novel's
   publication in 1980. The first thread is set in a 1998 ravaged by
   ecological disasters such as algal blooms and diebacks on the brink of
   large scale extinctions. Various other events are mentioned in passing,
   such as student riots and an event of nuclear terrorism against New
   York City which took place before the events of the novel. This thread
   follows a group of scientists in the United Kingdom connected with the
   University of Cambridge and their attempts to warn the past of the
   impending disaster by sending tachyon-induced messages to the
   astronomical position the Earth occupied in 1962-1963. Given the
   faster-than-light nature of the tachyon, these messages will
   effectively reach the past. These efforts are led by John Renfrew, an
   Englishman, and Gregory Markham, an American most likely modeled on
   Benford himself.^[6]

   The second thread is set in the University of California, San Diego
   (UCSD), in La Jolla, California, in 1962 where a young scientist,
   Gordon Bernstein, discovers anomalous noise in a physics experiment
   relating to spontaneous resonance and indium antimonide. He and his
   student assistant, Albert Cooper (also likely based on the author and
   his experiences at UCSD), discover that the noise is coming in bursts
   timed to form Morse code.

   The resulting message is made of staccato sentence fragments and
   jumbled letters, due to the 1998 team's efforts to avoid a grandfather
   paradox. Their aim is to give the past researchers enough information
   to start efforts on solving the pending ecological crisis, but not
   enough that the crisis will be entirely solved (thus making a signal to
   the past unnecessary and creating a paradox). Due to the biological
   nature of the message, Professor Bernstein shares the message with a
   professor of biology, Michael Ramsey. Since the message also gives
   astronomical coordinates, he also shares it with Saul Shriffer, a
   fictional scientist who is said to have worked with Frank Drake on
   Project Ozma. Initially, these characters fail to understand the true
   meaning of the message. Ramsey believes it to be an intercepted
   military dispatch hinting at Soviet bioterrorism, while Shriffer thinks
   the message is of extraterrestrial origin. Shriffer goes public with
   this theory, mentioning Bernstein in his findings. However, Bernstein's
   overseer, Isaac Lakin, is skeptical of the messages and wants Bernstein
   to keep working on his original project and ignore the signal. As a
   result of this interruption in their experimentation, Bernstein is
   denied a promotion and Cooper fails a candidacy examination. The signal
   also exacerbates difficulties in Bernstein's relationship with his
   girlfriend, Penny.

   In 1998, Ian Peterson recovers a safe deposit box in La Jolla
   containing a piece of paper indicating that the messages were received.
   Meanwhile, it is clear that the viral nature of the algal bloom is
   spreading it faster and through more mediums than originally expected.
   Strange yellow clouds that have been appearing are said to be a result
   of the viral material being absorbed through the water cycle, and it
   soon affects the planet's agriculture as well, resulting in widespread
   cases of food poisoning. Flying to the United States, Markham is killed
   in a plane crash when the pilots fly too close to one of the clouds and
   experience seizures.

   In the past storyline, now advanced into 1963, Bernstein refuses to
   give up on the signals. He is rewarded when the signal noise is also
   observed in a laboratory at Columbia University (a nod "Tachyons were
   the sort of audacious idea that comes to young minds used to roving
   over the horizon of conventional thought. Because of Feinberg I later
   set part of my tachyon novel at Columbia" towards the inventor of the
   tachyon concept, Gerald Feinberg of Columbia). Using hints in the
   message, Ramsey replicates the conditions of the bloom in a controlled
   experiment and realizes the danger it represents. Bernstein finds out
   that the astronomical coordinates given in the message represent where
   the Earth will be in 1998 due to the solar apex. He also receives a
   more coherent, despairing message from the future. Having built a solid
   case, Bernstein goes public and publishes his results.

   This decision has monumental consequences. On November 22, a high
   school student in Dallas is sent by his physics teacher to the Texas
   School Book Depository to get a copy of Bernstein's findings. There he
   interrupts Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination attempt on President John
   F. Kennedy, attacking the shooter and sending the would-be fatal third
   shot awry. Though seriously injured, Kennedy survives. This paradox
   creates an alternate universe and forever ends the contact with the
   original 1998.

   The concluding chapters portray the 1998 of the original timeline as a
   bleak, failing world, the intensified ecological disaster taking a
   noticeable toll on the human way of life. Peterson retreats to a
   fortified country farmhouse which he has obviously prepared well in
   advance. Renfrew continues to send out signals (including the more
   coherent one that Gordon receives) until the building's generator gives
   out. Before it does, however, he receives a signal purportedly from the
   year 2349.

   In the final chapter, set in the alternate 1974, an awards ceremony is
   held for achievement in science. In light of Kennedy's survival, the
   United States President giving out the awards is William Scranton, who
   is said to have defeated Bobby Kennedy due to a telephone tapping
   scandal. The scientists whose work stemmed from the signal are honored,
   including Bernstein, who receives the Enrico Fermi Prize for his
   discovery of the tachyon.
