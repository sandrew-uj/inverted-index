   "Swift death awaits the first cow that leads a revolt against milking,"
   wrote Swedish Professor Peder Bjornsen just before he died of a heart
   attack in May 2015. Bill Graham, investigating the deaths of two
   scientists his agency has funded, discovers that over a dozen
   scientists who knew each other have died recently, either by heart
   attack or by suicide, after appearing to go insane. With the aid of
   police lieutenant Art Wohl, Graham searches out other scientists who
   knew the men in the group and finds that they are dying as well. He
   finally meets a scientist who explains what's been happening.

   Professor Bjornsen had discovered a means of extending human vision
   into the far infrared and he discovered that the world is occupied by
   meter-wide spheres that appear pale blue in his new vision. The
   spheres, which he called Vitons, are sentient and mildly telepathic
   (they can read people's minds if they get close enough); they also feed
   on the electrochemical energy of human emotions. If a Viton sucks too
   hard on a human nervous system, it causes a fatal heart attack, which
   is how the Vitons have been killing the scientists, in order to prevent
   Humanity from learning of their existence.

   That knowledge, including Professor Bjornsen's formula, is quickly
   spread around the world. The Vitons react by triggering an all-out
   world war. They enjoy a world-wide feeding frenzy as they work to
   regain control over their "cattle". Chased into a hospital by a pair of
   Vitons, Graham and Wohl discover that the phantom vampires shy away
   from a machine that emits short-wave radio energy.

   Given that information, researchers all over the world struggle to find
   a form of radio transmission that will kill Vitons. Graham continues to
   seek out clues, obtaining them from people that the Vitons kill.
   Eventually he gets the necessary information and a ray gun, built like
   an anti-aircraft gun, is set up and tested. Graham destroys dozens of
   Vitons before the gun is destroyed and he is nearly killed. All
   relevant information on the gun has been widely disseminated and more
   guns are built and put to use. Seeing Vitons being destroyed, people
   sober up and the war winds down. There's a huge mess to clean up and
   plenty more Vitons to kill, but Humanity will prevail.
