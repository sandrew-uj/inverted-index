   The narrator, an archeologist, is visiting the town of Ille in the
   Languedoc-Roussillon region of France. A friend of his recommends him
   to M. de Peyrehorade, who is familiar with the Roman ruins in the area.
   When he arrives, he discovers that M. de Peyrehorade's son, Alphonse,
   is to be married to a certain Mademoiselle de Puygarrig, and the
   narrator is invited to the wedding.

   Merimee's Venus d'Ille

   Meanwhile, M. de Peyrehorade shows the narrator his new discovery: a
   bronze statue of Venus Pudica. The narrator judges the statue to be
   very old and deciphers the inscription. Both men marvel at her fierce
   gaze; she is as frightening as she is beautiful. She also seems to be
   cursed: the man who found her had his leg broken, and another man who
   threw a stone at her was injured by the stone rebounding and striking
   him.

   Before the wedding, the groom decides to play a game of Paume, and he
   slips the wedding ring intended for his fiancee onto a finger of the
   statue. He wins the game, but his opponents swear revenge. He
   accidentally leaves the ring with the statue; and when he goes back
   later to retrieve it, he discovers that the statue has closed her
   fingers around it. The narrator does not believe Alphonse's story,
   since Alphonse has been drinking heavily at the reception, and he goes
   to bed.

   During the night, the narrator hears heavy footsteps climbing the
   stairs; but he assumes that it is a drunken Alphonse going to bed. In
   the morning, after the cock's crow, he hears the same steps retreating
   down the stairs. Suddenly, there is screaming and commotion. The
   narrator runs down the hall to find a crowd of people surrounding the
   dead Alphonse, who looks as though he died in a fiery embrace.

   At first, he suspects that it was the rival faction from the game of
   Paume; but later he hears the story of Alphonse's wife, who others
   claim has gone crazy. She says that the statue entered the room,
   embraced her husband, and spent the entire night with him in her arms.
   In the morning, the statue left him there and returned to her pedestal.

   The narrator leaves town to return to Paris. He later hears that M. de
   Peyrehorade has died, and his wife had the statue melted down and
   turned into a bell for the local church. The narrator remarks that
   since the bell has been installed, the crops have been destroyed twice
   by frost.
