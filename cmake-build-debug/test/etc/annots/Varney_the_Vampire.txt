   The story has a confused setting. While ostensibly set in the early
   eighteenth century, there are references to the Napoleonic Wars and
   other indicators that the story is contemporary to the time of its
   writing in the mid-nineteenth century. Varney's adventures also occur
   in various locations including London, Bath, Winchester, Naples and
   Venice.
