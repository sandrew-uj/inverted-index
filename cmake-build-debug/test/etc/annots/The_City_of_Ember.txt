   A coalition of architects, scientists, and doctors known as "The
   Builders" have built Ember, an isolated, underground city with enough
   supplies for its inhabitants to survive at least 200 years. The goal is
   to keep humanity safe from an impending apocalyptic disaster. They
   handed the first mayor of the city a locked box holding instructions
   for the city's inhabitants on how to leave Ember when the time comes,
   to be passed down from one mayor to the next. After roughly 200 years,
   the timer on the lock will expire and the box will open to reveal the
   instructions inside. The box is passed successfully from mayor to
   mayor, until the seventh mayor who, thinking the box might contain a
   cure for his deadly cough, takes the box home and tries multiple times
   to break it open, but fails. He then dies before he can return the box
   to its rightful place or inform the next mayor of its importance.

   Approximately two hundred and forty-one years after Ember is
   established, the city's supplies are in danger of exhaustion and its
   hydroelectric generator is in decay, causing the power to go out
   intermittently. At their graduation ceremony, young people are assigned
   jobs by lottery: Lina Mayfleet is assigned the job of "Pipeworks
   Laborer" and Doon Harrow is given the job of "Messenger". However, both
   are displeased with their assigned jobs so they exchange their
   assignments and begin work in their respective positions. It is
   revealed that the seventh mayor was Lina's great-great grandfather and
   the box with the timed lock is in the closet in their house. By now the
   timer has finished counting down and the lock has clicked opened. When
   searching the closet, Lina's grandmother finds the box but tosses it
   aside, not realizing its importance. The opened box is found by Lina's
   baby sister, Poppy. When Lina comes home, she finds Poppy with torn
   pieces of paper in her hands and mouth, Poppy has all but destroyed the
   instructions. Lina saves the scraps of paper, thinking they must be an
   important message from the Builders of the city, since the message is
   typed and no one in Ember can write like that. The writing on the
   message resembles the writing on labels and books left by the builders
   in the city. Using some glue, Lina reassembles the message as best she
   can. There are many gaps and some words make no sense like "boat" since
   no one in Ember has seen or heard of boats. Thanks to side character
   Clary, friend of Lina's father, she discovers that the title of the
   document is "Instructions for Egress" or instructions for exit. Lina
   realizes that the document is instructions on how to leave their dying
   city. One of the words on the instructions is clearly "Pipeworks", so
   Lina enlists the help of Doon who is now working at the Pipeworks. The
   Pipeworks are underneath the city and a large and fast underground
   river runs through it that provides the hydroelectric power that Ember
   runs on. After much trial and error, she and Doon decipher the
   instructions from the builders. The instructions lead to a hidden room
   built on the side of the river that contains hundreds of boats as well
   as matches and candles to create portable light, something unknown in
   the city of Ember. The builders meant for the citizens of Ember to
   board these boats and be carried down the river into the outside world.

   Lina's grandmother dies shortly after their discovery, and Lina and
   Poppy move in with a neighbor, Mrs. Murdo. At work, Doon discovers that
   the mayor of Ember and a storeroom worker named Looper have been
   stealing supplies, and he and Lina report the crime to the guards, who
   unknown to them are also corrupt. Upon following the instructions given
   in the note, they find the room with boats and candles meant for use in
   the exodus. On their return to Ember, they learn that the mayor has
   declared them criminals and there are notices everywhere with their
   names. Doon and Lina plan to escape Ember in the boats and agree to
   meet at the Pipeworks at a certain time, but just before, Lina is
   arrested and taken to the mayor, who plans to throw her in jail.
   Suddenly, a blackout occurs and allows her to escape without being
   seen; she meets Doon at the Pipeworks with her sister Poppy in tow.
   Lina, Doon, and Poppy escape in a boat through the river, its current
   carrying them forward. When the boat stops, they learn the origin of
   Ember from a diary left by one of its original colonists. Shortly after
   they are faced with a very steep climb and emerge onto the surface
   where they see their city from above and realize for the first time
   that Ember is underground. They throw a rock with instructions tied to
   it down to the city in hope that the people of Ember will escape.
   Ultimately, Mrs. Murdo finds the message on the street.
