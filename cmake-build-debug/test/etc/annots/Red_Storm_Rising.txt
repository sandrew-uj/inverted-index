   Militants from Azerbaijan destroy an oil production refinery in
   Nizhnevartovsk, threatening to cripple the Soviet Union's economy due
   to oil shortages. After much deliberation, the Soviet Politburo decides
   to seize the Persian Gulf by military force in order to recoup the
   country's oil losses. Knowing that the United States had pledged to
   defend the oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf, the Soviets
   decide that neutralizing NATO is a necessary first step before its
   military operation can take place.

   To divert attention from the impending operation, the Politburo embarks
   upon an elaborate maskirovka to disguise both their predicament and
   their intentions. The Soviets publicly declare their arms reduction
   proposal to scrap their obsolete nuclear missile submarines. The KGB
   then carries out a false flag operation involving a bomb being
   detonated in a Kremlin building, framing a KGB sleeper agent as a West
   German intelligence spy involved in the incident. The Politburo
   publicly denounces the West German government and calls for
   retaliation. With West Germany neutralized and occupied, the Soviets
   believe that the United States would not move to rescue the Arab states
   since it could meet its oil needs from the Western Hemisphere alone.

   Even though a planned attack on a NATO communications facility in
   Lammersdorf was compromised when a Spetsnaz officer was arrested, the
   Soviets push through with their advance operations in Germany. However,
   they suffer reverses on the first night of the war, when NATO stealth
   and fighter-bomber aircraft achieve air superiority over Eastern Europe
   by eliminating Soviet AWACS and fighter aircraft, as well as bombing
   many key bridges that much of the Soviet Army has yet to cross.

   Nevertheless, the Soviet Navy achieves a decisive early victory against
   a US Navy carrier group by using air-launched decoy drones to draw the
   carrier's air patrol far away while Tu-16 Badger bombers attack from
   another direction, causing considerable damage. The Soviets secure
   further advantage by occupying Iceland, taking control of the NATO
   airbase in Keflavik and ensuring command of the strategically important
   GIUK gap. U.S. Air Force lieutenant Mike Edwards escapes the attack and
   hides behind enemy lines, serving as a scout for NATO forces. The
   Soviet Navy also attack several resupply convoys from North America as
   well as a NATO carrier battle group in the North Atlantic, causing
   severe losses to the other side. Meanwhile, the Soviet Air Force engage
   in a fierce air battle over Norway and later secure a rocket launch
   site there, bringing key NATO radar and air stations in nearby Scotland
   within range of sustained air attack.

   After much difficulty in occupying West Germany, the Soviet Army, led
   by General-Colonel Pavel Alekseyev, score a breakthrough in a tank
   battle over Alfeld, threatening to proceed west of Weser River without
   heavy resistance from NATO forces. Meanwhile, a naval attack on Soviet
   bomber bases with cruise missiles launched by NATO submarines paves the
   way for an amphibious assault on Iceland, retaking the island and
   effectively closing the Atlantic to Soviet forces. While Edwards is
   first reinforced by a squad of Royal Marines and then rescued by the
   United States Marines, a Soviet prisoner on the island reveals the true
   cause of the war, narrowing down bombing priorities to the Soviet
   Army's forward fuel depots and immobilizing the Soviet formations.

   In Moscow, the desperate Politburo considers deploying nuclear weapons
   to stave off defeat. This infuriates Alekseyev, who had been mobilizing
   for a final counterattack on Germany but faces execution by the Soviet
   government for its slow timetable. He later takes part in a coup d'etat
   orchestrated by the KGB in the Kremlin, arresting the government
   ministers and establishing a troika to temporarily preside over the
   country. The new Soviet government then negotiates for a ceasefire with
   NATO and a return to status quo ante bellum, effectively ending the
   conflict.
