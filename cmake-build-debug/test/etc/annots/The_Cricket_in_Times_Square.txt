   The story is about a cricket from Connecticut named Chester who gets
   caught on a train for New York. After stumbling on the subway, Chester
   ends up in Times Square. Mario Bellini, who helps his parents run a
   newsstand, finds Chester and takes him to the newsstand, as he wants to
   keep the cricket as a pet and for good luck. Mama Bellini is worried
   that the cricket will give the family germs, but Papa Bellini is more
   easygoing about the cricket's presence. At the newsstand, Chester meets
   Tucker Mouse and Harry Cat, who spend their time scrounging the city
   for food and other thrown-away items. They show him Times Square, which
   Chester finds overwhelming, although he also sees its beauty. During
   the story, Chester reveals his musical chirping talent. Mario takes
   Chester to Chinatown, where he buys Chester a cricket cage from the
   Chinatown shop owner Sai Fong.

   At one point, Chester accidentally eats a two dollar bill from the
   newsstand cashier. Mama Bellini wants Chester to go, but Tucker gives
   part of his coin collection that he has collected from scrounging to
   save Chester and replace the money. Later, the three friends have a
   party at the Newsstand, and Tucker accidentally knocks over a box of
   matches and sets the newsstand on fire. Mama Bellini blames Chester.
   However, at the right moment, Chester chirps Mama Bellini's favorite
   song, which she sings along to and which also leads her to change her
   mind. It soon becomes clear that Chester has a perfect memory for
   music, as he chirps opera selections, which surprises Papa Bellini.

   Chester decides to go home to Connecticut. He gives a final concert
   that causes Times Square and blocks of New York City to fall still,
   with everyone stopping to listen to the music. Mario plays one last
   time with Chester at the newsstand after that last concert, and falls
   asleep after a while. Later that same night, after Chester gives a
   farewell chirp to Mario, Harry and Tucker take Chester to Grand Central
   Terminal so that Chester can hop on to a train. At Grand Central, they
   all say good-bye. Later, when Mario wakes up as his parents have
   returned, he realizes later that Chester has gone home, but accepts
   this by saying: "And I'm glad." The story ends with Tucker telling
   Harry that maybe they'll visit the Connecticut country area one day.
