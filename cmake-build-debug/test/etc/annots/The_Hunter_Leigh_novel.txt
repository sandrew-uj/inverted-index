   Cradle Mountain, part of the Tasmanian Wilderness

   The book opens with the arrival in Tasmania of a man with the assumed
   identity of "Martin David, Naturalist" (referred to as M in the
   narrative). He is met at the home of Lucy Armstrong, where he is
   staying, by her children, Sass and Bike. The following morning, he
   meets Jack Mindy and is escorted up the escarpment towards the plateau.
   He learns that Jarrah Armstrong, the husband of Lucy and father to her
   children, has been missing in the area since last summer.

   M meets Lucy for the first time at the home. Against his own conviction
   that her father is dead, he promises to Sass that he will try to find
   him. Over the next few weeks he makes two excursions into the
   wilderness, for the last confirmed sighting of the thylacine (Tasmanian
   tiger), but returns from each without success. Arriving back he finds
   Lucy "drug addled and confused" and that Sass has rummaged through his
   belongings after suspecting him of lying about her father. M again
   ventures several times to the plateau, and each time he returns to the
   house he observes Lucy's condition gradually improving. During one he
   discovers presumed remains of Jarrah Armstrong; in another, he
   encounters the print of the thylacine and fails to shoot what he
   suspects is the creature. On his return, he receives a message calling
   him away from Tasmania; as he leaves the family he admits to himself
   that he will miss them.

   After a prolonged absence, M arrives back in Tasmania to find the
   Armstrong house empty. Mindy's wife relates that during his absence
   Sass was admitted to a children's hospital in Sydney, having been
   involved in a house fire that left her severely burned. Lucy, suffering
   from a mental breakdown, was placed into a mental hospital and Bike was
   put into foster care. M returns to the escarpment, now patrolled by
   National Park people, and spends the following weeks subsisting in the
   forest. He comes across a camp set up by two adolescents --"Small" and
   "Tall"--and stalks them until he comes across the suspected "lair" of
   the thylacine. After a time he emerges from the lair and shoots the
   animal, killing it. He dissects it and then burns the body. On his
   return journey down the escarpment he encounters Tall and Small, who
   are unaware of his real purpose or actions.
