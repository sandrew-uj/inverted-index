   In 2210, the starship Herodotus left Earth. On board were Julian "Bean"
   Delphiki and his three infant children - Ender, Carlotta, and
   Cincinnatus - all of whom have Anton's Key turned. This genetic
   alteration, which Bean passed to his children, grants them all
   extremely high intelligence, but causes their bodies to grow
   uncontrollably, which is likely to kill them by the age of 20.
   Subjectively, they have been flying near light-speed for five years,
   but relativistic effects mean that 421 years have passed on Earth - the
   year is now 2631. When the family left, scientists were actively trying
   to find a cure for their giantism which would not diminish their
   intelligence. Several generations have passed, they have been
   forgotten, and their mother and "normal" siblings having died centuries
   ago. The children have only been alive for six subjective years. Bean's
   life has been extended by the low gravity on board the Herodotus, which
   allows his heart to keep beating despite his increasingly gigantic
   size. At 4.5 metres tall, Bean must remain in a lying position in the
   cargo bay so as not to over-exert himself. He controls and watches
   everything on the ship through his holo-top terminal, often prompting
   the children to have secret meetings they believe the Giant cannot
   hear. Bean and Ender continue to study their genetic condition in the
   hope of finding a cure.

   In one of these meetings, the militarily-minded Cincinnatus (nicknamed
   "Sergeant") tries to enlist the aid of his siblings in killing their
   father, saying he is a drain on resources. The sensitive Carlotta
   (whose specialty is engineering) is unwilling to take a stance, but
   Ender (an expert biologist) punches Sergeant and breaks his nose for
   proposing such an idea, thus ending his brother's domination over the
   family. Ender and Carlotta tell Bean about Sergeant's plans, and Bean
   puts all three children in their place, reminding them they are each as
   intelligent as the other. Sergeant has been imagining threats to their
   security where there are none, because he believes the Giant means to
   pass his soldier role onto him. So he studies the Formic war vids,
   learning his father's strategy while training himself with weaponry.
   Ender takes on the bulk of the genetic studies by monitoring the
   advances made by the scientists on Earth. Carlotta, who feels slightly
   left behind with the genetic studies serves the family by taking care
   of every aspect of the spacecraft, since Bean himself is stuck in the
   cargo hold.

   After despairing at the condition of their lives, and in the light of
   the discovery that their condition cannot be cured, Carlotta notices an
   unknown spacecraft in geosync orbit around an uncharted planet in the
   Goldilocks zone. Bean and his children deliberate courses of action. If
   they alter their course, they must slow down to turn, possibly killing
   Bean with the increased gravity. However, they cannot anticipate who or
   what is in the spacecraft; it may attack them, or they may be
   detrimental to the survival and progression of the human race. This
   hypothesis is solidified when Sergeant deduces that the ship is a
   Formic Ark, a colony ship that has been in flight for centuries.

   Bean sends Sergeant alone to investigate the ship, and he escapes an
   attack by small Formic-like animals they call "rabs" (rats+crabs).
   After this initial encounter, Bean reveals his full plan to his
   children. They must find out who is piloting this ship and attempting
   to terraform the planet it orbits. It was Bean's intention all along to
   have his children live on this planet and found their new species in
   safety as soon as he picked it up on radar as lying within the
   Goldilocks zone. Armed with Sergeant's weapons and a sedative fog spray
   Ender devised, Sergeant commands defenses as Carlotta leads their group
   to the helm with Bean in contact the whole time. The spray proves
   effective, and they soon find the Hive Queen's chamber, finding her,
   and many workers, dead. Eventually they find living male Formics in one
   of the piloting helms.

   In an attempt to communicate, Ender surrenders himself by drifting
   close to them in zero gravity. The male drones come close and
   communicate with Ender via mental images. The group learns that the Ark
   was sent long before Ender Wiggin, whom Bean's son is named for, wiped
   out the buggers. After the Queen on their ship died, the workers died
   without her link, yet the males lived and tried to survive and keep the
   ship running, despite losing numbers to the feral rabs. The group
   strikes a deal that if the children can wipe out the rabs, they can
   stay with the Formics and help cultivate the planet. When Bean learns
   from the male drones that Ender Wiggin is carrying a queen's cocoon
   looking for a home, and that Formic workers do have minds of their own
   contrary to popular belief, he demands to speak with the Formics in
   order to warn Ender, despite risking his life in the journey.

   Accepting that his children have achieved beyond his wildest
   expectations, Bean risks his life by docking with the ark's cargo hold
   to float down into the ecotat. Lying in the grass and basking in the
   artificial sunlight, Bean communes for three days with the formic
   males. Though the Formics think it is silly to believe the Queen would
   hide anything from them, Bean learns that workers could rebel against a
   Queen and regain their free will. After Bean has slept for a while, his
   children wake him, informing him that by studying how the Hive Queen
   suppresses her workers, Ender has devised and administered a virus that
   will develop an organelle to shut off their growth genome, leaving
   their intelligence intact but saving them from the giantism half of
   Anton's Key.

   With renewed hope for the future, Bean looks at the beauty around him
   and remembers all those whom he loved and who loved him in his life.
   With his children's help, he stands at four and a half meters for the
   first time in years, and walks with labored breathing in the sunlight.
   Happy for his children and for his own short but brilliant life, Bean
   lies down and dies in peace.
