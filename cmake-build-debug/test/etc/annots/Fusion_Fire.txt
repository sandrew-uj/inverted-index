   Firebird and new husband Brennen Caldwell being attacked in the middle
   of the night by someone with telepathic powers, thus of Ehretan
   heritage.

   Firebird continues her study of Netaian political simulations, hoping
   to stave off societal collapse of her dysfunctional homeworld. She also
   studies her new religion and telepathy, having accidentally discovered
   that the Angelo bloodline carried Ehretan genes (and hence Ehretan
   powers) A second successful turn, during labor, nearly kills her as
   well. As this uncontrolled ability threatens any telepath that might be
   near her, she is quarantined--even from her newborn sons.

   Meanwhile, Phoena Angelo continues to chafe while Netaia is under
   Federate occupation, and her latest scheme involves asking the Shuhr
   for assistance. However, they mentally dominate her and reduce her to
   an unwitting pawn, using her as a source for exploring the lost Ehretan
   gene sequences, as well as pillaging the material wealth of Netaia.

   Phoena's foppish husband, Tel Tellai, humbles himself by asking
   Caldwell's assistance in rescuing her, despite the impossible odds.
   Ongoing diplomatic and military developments force the issue of
   Phoena's rescue, but Caldwell finally accepts the mission only after a
   divine vision. Using new technology to amplify his mental abilities, he
   sets out to infiltrate the Shuhr homeworld of Three Zed in a rescue
   attempt. He finds Phoena, but is captured. She is tortured to death
   while the Shuhr enjoyed her psychic screams of pain, at last realizing
   she'd been played for the fool, and only Brennen is there to mourn her
   death. The Shuhr leaders extract DNA samples from him for their cloning
   efforts, and try to force secrets from him. To thwart them, Caldwell
   gives himself amnesia blocks.

   Tel, exposed to non-Netaian ideas for the first time, begins to doubt
   Phoena's character and motives, though he remains fiercely devoted to
   her. He also comes to a healthy respect for Caldwell, and the Sentinels
   and Federacy in general. When Ellet Kinsman, a Sentinel officer and
   Firebird's romantic rival for Caldwell's affections, shows her how she
   can pursue and rescue Brennen, Firebird (also after divine guidance)
   seizes the chance, and takes the matured Tel as her copilot.

   On Netaia, Queen Carradee's rule and reforms are seen as ineffectual
   and even harmful to the ruling class, who force her to abdicate after
   her chambers are bombed, almost resulting in the death of Prince
   Consort Daithi Drake-Angelo. Carradee and Daithi are welcomed to Hesed
   House, the Sentinel retreat, and Daithi is given better medical care
   than is available on Netaia. As he begins to recover, the two of them
   also begin to see the Federacy, especially the gentle faith of the
   Sentinels, in a new light.

   Firebird and Tel are discovered, but she is allowed to free Caldwell
   before they are both captured again. Tel remains in the shuttle, and is
   mentally incapacitated by the monitoring Shuhr. Caldwell is a wreck,
   having faced physical and psychic torture for days, and his
   self-imposed amnesia has progressed to the point where he cannot even
   remember who Firebird is. Firebird manages to turn again, allowing
   Caldwell to jumpstart his powers temporarily, overcome their attackers,
   and escape with Tel's help.

   The Federacy discovers the Shuhr were developing their own
   psi-amplification and fusion technologies, which would have allowed
   them to dominate every world in that arm of the galaxy.
