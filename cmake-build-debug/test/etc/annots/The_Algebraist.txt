   The novel takes place in 4034. With the assistance of other species,
   humans have spread across the galaxy, which is largely ruled by the
   Mercatoria, a complex feudal hierarchy, with a religious zeal to rid
   the galaxy of artificial intelligences, which were blamed for a
   previous war.

   The central character is the human Fassin Taak who is a "Slow Seer" at
   the Court of the Nasqueron Dwellers. The Nasqueron's star system has
   been cut off from the rest of Mercatoria civilization because their
   portal (the only means of faster than light travel) was destroyed by
   the Beyonders. The Beyonders are a large fleet of space marauders who
   originated from the fringes of the galaxy. The local Mercatoria
   adherents await the delivery of a wormhole connection from a
   neighboring system via sub-lightspeed travel.

   The Nasqueron Dwellers are an advanced and ancient civilisation of
   non-humanoids who inhabit gas giants. They lead an almost anarchic
   existence based on kudos, and inhabit the majority of gas-giant planets
   in the galaxy. They are the only major species outside the control of
   the Mercatoria, being rumoured to possess devastating defensive
   weaponry. Dweller societies try not to get involved with "Quick"
   species, those with sentient beings who experience life at around the
   speed human beings experience it. Dwellers are one of the "Slow"
   species who experience life at a much slower rate. Dweller individuals
   live for millions of years, and the species has existed for billions of
   years, long before the foundation of the Mercatoria. Slow Seers like
   Taak are a dynasty of researchers who attempt to glean information from
   the Dwellers' vast but disorganised libraries of knowledge. They do it
   in part by artificially slowing their metabolisms to better communicate
   with the Dwellers.

   Taak is looking forward to a life of quiet scholarship when he is
   astonished to be drafted into one of the Mercatoria's religio-military
   orders. It turns out that in a previous research expedition to the
   Dweller-inhabited gas-giant Nasqueron, Taak inadvertently uncovered a
   book containing information about the legendary "Dweller List" of
   coordinates for their own private systems of wormholes. Since Dwellers
   are sufficiently long-lived to colonise the galaxy at sub-light speed,
   the very existence of such a network was considered doubtful.

   The Dweller List is only a list of star systems. Portals are relatively
   small and can be anywhere within a system so long as it is a point of
   low gravitational gradient, such as a Lagrange point. The list is
   useless without a certain mathematical transform needed to give the
   exact location of the portals. Taak must go on a further expedition to
   Nasqueron in order to find the Transform.

   The Archimandrite Luseferous is a tyrannical warlord of the Starveling
   Cult. He is in loose alliance with the Beyonders. He sets out to invade
   the Ulubis system from the Cluster Epiphany Five Disconnect while also
   aiming to possess the secrets of the Dweller portals. A Mercatoria
   counter-attack fleet hurries to defend Ulubis against the Starveling
   Cult ships and their Beyonder allies. Both fleets are forced to travel
   at sub light speeds, leaving the inhabitants of the Ulubis system
   anxiously wondering which will arrive first.

   Taak's hunt for the Transform takes him on a journey, partly through
   the Dweller wormhole network. In a back story, it is revealed that he
   has been out of sympathy with the Mercatoria for some time,
   particularly over their treatment of artificial intelligences, and has
   in fact been a Beyonder agent. It is also revealed that the Dwellers
   have been harbouring artificial intelligences from Mercatoria
   persecution.

   The Beyonder/Starveling forces arrive and easily overwhelm Ulubis's
   native defences. They discover to their dismay that the counter-attack
   force is arriving much sooner than predicted, and is superior. The
   Beyonder factions despair of locating Taak and the secret in the time
   available before the recapture of Ulubis, and retreat. The Starvelings
   under Luseferous remain. He makes a last-ditch attempt to force the
   Dwellers to yield up Taak, threatening them with antimatter weapons.
   The Dwellers respond with devastating blows on his fleet. Luseferous
   flees under Mercatoria pursuit.

   Taak returns from his journey with his memory partly erased. He is
   still able to piece together the secret from the remaining clues: every
   massive body has a region of zero net gravitational attraction at its
   exact centre. The Dwellers have hidden wormhole portals in the cores of
   all their occupied planets, and the Transform was never necessary. It
   remains unclear whether the Dwellers will give the necessary
   cooperation in allowing other species access to their network, now that
   the secret is out.

   The novel ends with Taak, having left Ulubis and joined the Beyonders,
   suggesting to a lifelong friend he has just discovered is an AI, "One
   day we'll all be free".
