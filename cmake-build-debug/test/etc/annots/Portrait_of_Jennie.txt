   In 1934, impoverished painter Eben Adams (Joseph Cotten) meets a fey
   little girl named Jennie Appleton (Jennifer Jones) in Central Park,
   Manhattan. She is wearing old-fashioned clothing. He makes a sketch of
   her from memory which involves him with art dealer Miss Spinney (Ethel
   Barrymore), who sees potential in him. This inspires him to paint a
   portrait of Jennie.

   Eben encounters Jennie at intermittent intervals. Strangely, she
   appears to be growing up much more rapidly than is possible. He soon
   falls in love with her but is puzzled by the fact that she seems to be
   experiencing events that he discovers took place many years previously
   as if they had just happened. Eventually he learns the truth about
   Jennie and though inevitable tragedy ensues, she continues to be an
   inspiration to Eben's life and art, and his career makes a remarkable
   upturn, commencing with his portrait of Jennie.
