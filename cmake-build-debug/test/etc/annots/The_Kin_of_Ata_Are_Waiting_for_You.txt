   After murdering a lover, and crashing his car while fleeing the scene
   of the crime, a ruthlessly "successful" man is transported to an
   unknown island (called Ata) whose location is never revealed, the
   implication being that it doesn't physically exist in our world. The
   island is inhabited by people he gradually learns are a deceptively
   primitive. Every aspect of their waking lives is governed by their
   dream life. Initially in conflict with their ways, the unnamed
   protagonist, according to Bryant, "is dragged kicking and screaming to
   his own salvation." He gradually comes to realize that the people of
   this island support and maintain the real world through their dreaming,
   and that he needs to incorporate this world view so he can successfully
   return to his former life. It can be read as an allegory of spiritual
   growth, and shows the influence of modern anthropological writings on
   indigenous peoples and the writings of psychologist Carl Jung.
