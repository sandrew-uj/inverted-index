   Lieutenant Colonel Cletus Grahame has been an instructor at the Western
   Alliance military academy since a battle injury crippled one of his
   knees, and forced his retirement from active duty. He has completed
   three volumes of a planned twenty-volume series of books on military
   strategy and tactics, and believes his analysis can revolutionize
   military science, although many do not take his work seriously. Feeling
   he needs to get out in the field and try putting his theories into
   practice, he leaves the academy and arranges to be sent to the world of
   Kultis, where the Alliance is supporting the Exotic colony of Bakhalla
   in a war against the neighboring colony of Neuland, backed by the
   Coalition.

   The heart of his military strategy, based in part on fencing, is what
   he labels the "tactics of mistake," enticing one's opponent into
   overreaching, and being ready to take advantage of the mistake. This
   description is an adaptation of a similar concept in the novel
   Scaramouche by Rafael Sabatini when the character Moreau studies at the
   salon of the Master of Arms.

   On the first night out on the ship to Kultis, he deliberately
   antagonizes Dow deCastries, Secretary of Outworld Affairs for the
   Eastern Coalition, forcing deCastries to take notice of him. He also
   meets Colonel Eachan Khan, an officer of the Dorsai troops who have
   been hired by the Exotics, and Khan's daughter Melissa. Mondar, an
   Exotic official, is also present, and takes notice of Grahame.

   Putting his theories to work, Grahame repeatedly entices deCastries and
   the Neulanders into attempting incursions, where he is ready to pounce
   on them. Finally, after conveniently getting his own uncooperative
   commander out of the way, he entices them to launch a major invasion.
   Using the Dorsai troops, who had been underestimated and little-used by
   the Alliance command, he actually wins the war, handing deCastries a
   humiliating defeat.

   His victory has actually made him rather unpopular with his own
   command. Mondar, using the Exotic science of ontogenetics, recognizes
   him as a key mover of history, and tries to recruit him to join the
   Exotics, but he chooses instead to emigrate to the Dorsai, in order to
   begin building them into the kind of military force he envisions. It
   seems he possesses some of the advanced mental abilities of the
   Exotics, and with their help, he is able to heal his crippled knee.

   Melissa wants her father to return to Earth, and the General's rank he
   had enjoyed in the Western Alliance, and to do so, she needs the
   influence of deCastries. Grahame forces Melissa to marry him to prevent
   Eachan's departure, as he feels Eachan is necessary to his plans.

   Over the course of years, Grahame builds the Dorsai into the unique
   fighting force that becomes so famous in later years. With their
   advanced training and superior tactics, they can defeat larger forces
   and suffer far fewer casualties than any others, making them far more
   economical for other worlds to hire. Gradually, they reach a status
   where other worlds no longer need to depend on Earth for fighting
   forces to protect them, threatening Earth's control of the younger
   worlds through its system of client states.

   To prevent this loss of position, the two Earth factions, the Western
   Alliance and Eastern Coalition, unite their forces under deCastries,
   and attempt to stretch the Dorsai forces so thin that they will be
   conquered. When Earth invades the Dorsai, there are no soldiers to
   defend it, but deCastries underestimates the power of the Dorsai people
   themselves. The final result leads to a totally new balance of power
   among the settled worlds.

   (The actual battle for the Dorsai itself is given little coverage in
   this book. The ultimate battle for Foralie district, Grahame's home,
   ends up being between deCastries and Amanda Morgan, a woman in her late
   nineties who leads the home defense. In the novella, "Amanda Morgan",
   she is used as the ultimate example of the spirit of Dorsai.)
