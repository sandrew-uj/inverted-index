   Mueller-Mann, Leipzig, 1900

   The Beetle is told from the points of view of four narrators: Robert
   Holt, Sydney Atherton, Marjorie Lindon, and Augustus Champnell. The
   year is unspecified, but it is indicated that it is during the 1800s.
   All the events take place over a three-day period around Friday, June
   2nd. The novel begins with the account of Robert Holt, a clerk who has
   been looking for a place to work all day. He seeks shelter and food at
   a workhouse in Fulham. He is, however, denied, and continues walking
   through the dark and rain looking for another place to stay. He comes
   upon a road occupied by only two houses, one looking decrepit. He finds
   the window open, and seeks shelter inside. It is here that he
   encounters a monstrous figure, the mysterious Beetle.

   The Beetle takes control of his mind through mesmerism, allowing it to
   take on human form. In this encounter with the Beetle, the narrator
   makes it clear it is hard to distinguish whether the Beetle's human
   form is a man or a woman. The Beetle accuses Holt of being a thief and
   promises to treat him like one. The Beetle makes Holt take off his
   clothes and put on new ones in exchange for shelter and food. The
   Beetle forces a kiss on him that has a weakening effect on Holt. The
   Beetle's plan is to send Holt to Paul Lessingham's home to steal the
   contents of a protected drawer in his desk. If Holt is to encounter
   Lessingham, a member of the House of Commons, he is instructed to say
   "the Beetle", which should incapacitate him. Holt succeeds, in part
   because of the Beetle's ability to control him. Before he can leave
   with the contents of the desk drawer - letters tied together with a
   ribbon - Lessingham confronts him. In a voice that is not his own, Holt
   shouts "the Beetle" twice, forcing Lessingham to shiver in a corner and
   allowing Holt to jump through a window and escape. In the streets, he
   is accosted by another man, Sydney Atherton, who asks if he committed a
   crime against Lessingham. The man is pleased by the prospect and lets
   Holt go, who delivers the letters to the Beetle. The Beetle finds they
   are love letters from one Marjorie Lindon and proclaims that they will
   hurt Lessingham through her.

   The next narrative perspective comes from Sydney Atherton, a romantic
   rival of Paul Lessingham for the affection of Marjorie Lindon. The
   night of Holt's robbery, he proposed to Lindon at a ball. She told him
   she was already engaged in secret to Lessingham, but their engagement
   is a secret because her father is a political opponent of Lessingham.
   Lindon asks Atherton to speak to her father in favour of Lessingham,
   knowing that her father thinks of Atherton as a son. Consumed with
   self-pity and anger, Atherton leaves the ball after declining a dance
   with Dora Grayling. After leaving the encounter with Holt, he visits
   Lessingham to check on the situation. Lessingham insists that it is
   nothing and sends him away. Even more angry, Atherton plans to spend
   the next day in his laboratory working on his inventions in the area of
   chemical warfare. The Beetle approaches Atherton in his laboratory and
   initially tries to mesmerize him like Holt, but Atherton resists. This
   is also the moment in the text when the Beetle introduces themself as a
   child of Isis. They promise Atherton Lindon's love if he agrees, but
   Atherton, noticing the Arab has the eyes of a skilled hypnotist, does
   not agree.

   The Beetle leaves, and Lessingham arrives a moment later. He apologises
   for his curtness the previous night and requests that Atherton does not
   speak of it to anyone, claiming that he does not want to be bothered by
   any rumours that would be sure to come out of it. Atherton consents,
   prompting Lessingham to ask him some questions on ancient superstitions
   and extinct religions, which Atherton has some knowledge of. He brings
   up Isis, transmigration, and scarabs, eventually admitting he once saw
   a priest of Isis change shape into a scarab whilst dying. Atherton is
   sceptical but intrigued, but Lessingham retracts his trust and prepares
   to leave. Then his eyes fall on the picture of a scarab upon the shelf
   and retreats into the catatonic state similar to that when Holt uttered
   "the Beetle". Atherton snaps him out of it and promises not to tell
   anyone what he just witnessed. That night, Atherton apologises to
   Grayling at the Duchess of Datchet's ball. Grayling offers to finance
   Atherton's experiments, leading to an appointment in his laboratory and
   a follow-up lunch the next day. Atherton is also accosted by a friend
   of his, Percy Woodville. Atherton drags Woodville along after him to
   the House of Commons to hear Lessingham speak on the Agricultural
   Amendment Act. Though impressed with what he hears, Atherton refuses to
   admit it to Lindon. An altercation is only avoided due to Marjorie's
   father finding out about her and Lessingham, and she walks off with her
   fiance with her head held high. Aggravated, Atherton takes Woodville to
   his laboratory for a demonstration, picking up a stray cat on the way
   that he fantasizes to belong to Lessingham. He uses a concoction of his
   to kill the cat, almost killing Woodville in the process. He drags him
   outside, where the Beetle waits. When the Beetle ensures Woodville's
   survival, Atherton agrees to talk. He barely avoids being hypnotised
   and shows off his inventions to convince the Beetle that he too
   possesses magic that can get answers out of them. The Beetle claims
   Lessingham has killed a woman he was close with back in Egypt. Though
   eager to see revenge enacted on Lessingham, Atherton doesn't want
   Lindon to get dragged into the affair, and inquires further as to why
   the picture of a scarab scared Lessingham earlier. The Beetle denies
   knowledge and, as Atherton threatens them, changes before his eyes into
   a female scarab, dwindling from human size into a creature of six to
   seven inches high and roughly a foot in length in a matter of seconds.
   When Atherton tries to capture them, they change back and their
   undressed state shows that although they have the face and voice of an
   old man, their body is young and female. The Beetle flees and Atherton
   gathers a just-awakened Woodville from his yard.

   The next day, Atherton is surprised by a visit from Grayling,
   forgetting about their appointment. He insults her multiple times with
   comments insensitive to her feelings for him, and she leaves in anger.
   Next, he receives a visit from Marjorie's father, who wants him to
   speak with her about how Lessingham is not an appropriate match for
   her. When he receives a third surprise visit from Marjorie, her father
   hides behind a screen to spy on the conversation he wants Atherton to
   start. Unsure what to do, Atherton lets her speak of what ails her. She
   proceeds to tell him about the previous day, when she brought a
   near-naked and starving man (Holt) who was lying in the street into her
   house without her father's knowledge. Her reason for doing this was
   that the man mentioned that Lessingham was in danger and she wished to
   know more to protect him. Atherton knows it must be the man he saw two
   nights ago, but keeps quiet. Lindon elaborates that the previous night,
   she was attacked by an unseen force in her bedroom that sounded and
   felt like a beetle. Seeking help from Atherton, Lindon finds herself
   betrayed when her father steps out from behind the screen and accuses
   her of madness. Atherton takes her side, causing both Lindons to leave
   his house in an agitated state. The fourth coincidental visitor is
   Lessingham, who wants to know what Atherton knows given the picture of
   the scarab and his involvement so far. Neither man is willing to show
   their hand, but they agree that Lessingham is haunted and that if he
   ensures Lindon won't be dragged into it, Atherton will give him the
   benefit of the doubt regarding his innocence. Finally, Grayling returns
   still wishing to lunch, which Atherton accepts.

   The narrative perspective shifts once again, this time to Marjorie
   Lindon. Once home, Lindon finds her guest, Holt, awake and he tells her
   his tale. Astonished, Lindon has her servants fetch Atherton because
   she has no one else to turn to. When he arrives, he interrogates Holt
   enough to confirm his suspicions, but with enough ambiguity that he
   hopes he can fool Lindon into staying out of the affair. He fails,
   however, and Lindon insists that she go with the man as they search for
   the house of the Beetle. The three manage to find the house, but it is
   deserted. Suddenly, Holt is hypnotised again and runs out. Atherton and
   Lindon agree that he should follow Holt and that she will remain in the
   house in case the Beetle returns. He will send whomever he finds on his
   path to the house to aid her. Only minutes later, Lindon finds that the
   Beetle had hidden under the pillows. She tears off her clothes in a
   panic. Her account ends abruptly as she is captured by the Beetle.

   The final narrative account is given from the perspective of Detective
   Augustus Chapnell. Elsewhere, Champnell is finishing up the documents
   on the case of the Duchess of Datchet's deed-box when Lessingham enters
   his offices to acquire his services. Lessingham tells the tale behind
   his connection to the Beetle. Twenty years ago, Lessingham decided to
   go to Cairo, Egypt. Out on his own one night, he was lured by a young
   woman producing beautiful music and captured by the cult of Isis.
   Finding himself in a hypnotised state in the centre of their temple,
   Lessingham is made to do the bidding of the Woman of the Songs,
   evidently a high priestess. There, he was a witness to many human
   sacrifices, all white women. After one such sacrifice, he found the
   Woman of the Songs' control over him to be weak and attacked her,
   strangling her until she turned into a scarab. Somehow, he escaped the
   temple and was found and nursed back to health by American
   missionaries, after which he returned to England. As he explains his
   current predicament to Champnell, Atherton, a friend of Champnell's,
   bursts in to get his help in finding Lindon, whom, after losing sight
   of Holt, he found missing upon returning to the house. The three men
   quickly leave for the Beetle's house, but all they can find are
   Lindon's clothes and crudely cut hair. Champnell is the only one
   convinced she is still alive, as he knows of a case three years prior
   in which three siblings went missing in Cairo. The brother was found in
   a terrible mental state, claiming his sisters had been burned to death.
   He died before providing useful information, but a local claiming to
   know more offered the police information, telling them that there was a
   sect practising human sacrifice that favoured white Christian women,
   and even more so young English women. He was killed before he could
   lead the police to the sect and the case has remained unresolved ever
   since. Champnell knows Lindon is more valuable as a sacrifice, and
   therefore must still be alive.

   They go to inquire at the one other house on that road, which belongs
   to Louisa Coleman, who also owns the Beetle's house. She explains she
   rented it to the Beetle, but didn't like their manners and so has spied
   on them ever since. She confirms Holt and Atherton's departure hours
   ago and that Lindon had stayed. While she never saw Lindon leave, she
   did see a man she had never seen before enter and then leave a little
   later, followed after a while by the Beetle with a human-sized package
   on his head. Champnell theorises that the package contains only the
   Beetle's possessions, as they intended to return to Egypt, and that the
   man was Lindon disguised in Holt's old clothing. Acquiring information
   from an officer, the three men follow the Beetle to London Waterloo,
   where they learn that the Beetle boarded a train with two Englishmen
   who were behaving peculiarly. They alighted at Vauxhall and travelled
   on to Limehouse in search of a room to stay in. As the three men arrive
   at the local police station, they are informed that a man, previously
   in the company of an "Arab," has been found murdered. It turns out to
   be Holt, whose exhaustion and maltreatment finally caught up to him. He
   is, however, still alive, and tells Atherton to save Lindon, confirming
   her to be the other man, before he collapses. With police aid, the
   Beetle and Lindon are found to have taken a train to Hull from London
   St Pancras. They are provided with a special train to catch up with the
   abductor and abductee, but their journey ends in Luton, where the train
   they had been pursuing has been hit by cargo trucks from an earlier
   train. In the chaos, they find Lindon unconscious in one of the front
   coaches. As for the Beetle, all that remains are scattered pieces of
   burnt rags, which are stained with human blood.

   Champnell closes his tale by saying the events took place some years
   ago. Lessingham and Lindon have since married, and that he has become a
   great politician. Atherton and Grayling have married too, after
   Atherton came to understand the feelings between them. Holt lies buried
   in Kensal Green Cemetery under an expensive tombstone. As for the
   children of Isis, Champnell has heard from good sources that during an
   expeditionary advance towards Dongola, a temple and its occupants were
   discovered and the victims of an explosion. The corpses represented
   neither men nor women, but monstrous creatures, and the remnants of
   scarab artifacts were scattered around. Champnell declines to
   investigate the matter further, but does hope it is the temple that
   Lessingham spoke of that was destroyed.
