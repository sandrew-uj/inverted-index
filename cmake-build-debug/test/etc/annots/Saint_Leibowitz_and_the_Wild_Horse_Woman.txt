   The main character of the novel is Brother Blacktooth "Nimmy" St.
   George, a monk at Leibowitz Abbey. Brother Blacktooth, a former Nomad,
   is fluent both in Nomadic and Churchspeak. Unsatisfied with his job as
   a translator of ancient texts, and haunted by his roots as a Nomad,
   Blacktooth becomes increasingly restless. He feels pulled between the
   two societies: that of the church, and that of the wanderer.
   Blacktooth's reputation as a misfit compels the Abbot of Leibowitz,
   Jarad, to seek his expulsion from the order, while Blacktooth's unique
   linguistic skills attract the attention of the visiting Cardinal Elia
   Brownpony (called the Red Deacon since he was never ordained as a
   priest). Brownpony requires a translator in his travels in order to
   deal diplomatically with unruly Nomad tribes, the Grasshoppers and
   Jackrabbits. Thus, Cardinal Brownpony decides to enlist Nimmy's
   services, saving him from disgrace at the hands of Jarad.

   Brownpony and Nimmy set off to the conclave, along with Brownpony's
   other servants: Wooshin (aka "Axe"), a mysterious warrior from the
   Orient, and Chur Hongan (aka "Holy Madness"), his Nomadic driver. Soon
   afterward, the reigning Pope dies. A conclave of cardinals is called to
   elect a new one, including a Cardinal Abbess from N'Yok (New York). The
   Church had been exiled from the holy city of New Rome in previous
   decades because of an invasion by the king (or "Hannegan") of Texark.
   As a result, all papal affairs were conducted in the city of Valana,
   beyond the reach of the Texark empire.

   During their journeys, the group (specifically, Holy Madness) have a
   divine vision. The vision is of the Night Hag, who only appears to a
   man in order to announce the death of someone else. It is from her
   appearance that Brownpony infers the death of the Pope. The Night Hag
   is one of the three avatars of the Nomad goddess, Open Sky. Open Sky's
   other two avatars are The Buzzard of Battle and the Wild Horse Woman.

   Upon arriving at the settlement of Arch Hollow on the way to Valana,
   they are accosted by genetically handicapped Nomads. The Nomads are
   quickly subdued by Wooshin, an adept warrior. Among the Nomads, Nimmy
   has occasion to meet AEdrea, a beautiful mutant who is able to pass for
   healthy. The two fall in love, despite the fact that both are forbidden
   to fraternize: he because of his vows, she because of her genes. The
   group continues to Valana without her, and Nimmy is prohibited from
   seeing her again. Only after they have left Arch Hollow far behind does
   Blacktooth realize that he has left his rosary in AEdrea's possession.

   At the Conclave, Brownpony surprises the assembled cardinals by openly
   admitting that he is of Nomad ancestry. He makes this confession in
   order to embarrass a Texark scholar who was then present.
   Unfortunately, immediately after the outburst, a sickly student marches
   into the auditorium and attempts to assassinate the very same Texark
   infiltrator. Given the timing, it is widely presumed that Brownpony was
   behind the assassination, so attempts are made on the lives of
   Blacktooth and Brownpony. The violence of the Conclave escalates to a
   breaking point. The citizens of Valana, impatient for a new Pope,
   sequester the Conclave until the rival factions of cardinals (some
   allied with the Church, others with Texark) elect a new Pope. Under
   duress, the Conclave elects Amen Specklebird, a cryptic and oracular
   vagrant, who doubles as a cult icon for the Valanian people. Amen's
   election marks the first stage in a series of events that escalate
   tensions between Texark and the Church.

   Amen's reign as Pope proves to be short-lived. He makes an abortive
   attempt to return the Church to New Rome by sending a mission of Nomads
   and Cardinals east. The convoy is turned away by Texark guardsmen.
   However, the Nomadic contingent of the convoy, being hungry and poorly
   fed, decides to split from the Papal authority and raze the countryside
   around New Rome. Brownpony, with his entourage, are arrested by the
   Hannegan, Filpeo Harq, after a tense standoff in his palace. They are
   soon released under a suspended sentence of death.

   After the mission's failure, Amen controversially resigns as Pope and
   retreats to his old vagrant's cave overlooking Valana. While cardinals
   backed by the Hannegan declare the papacy illegitimate, a conclave of
   Valana clergy declare that Brownpony is Pope. Taking the name Amen II,
   Brownpony declares an effective crusade against the Texark Empire,
   leading an alliance of Nomads to recapture New Rome and excommunicating
   the Hannegan's cardinals.

   Meanwhile, Blacktooth accompanies the Valana militia, now led by
   Cardinals Nauwhat and Hadala, both of whom are of dubious loyalty to
   Brownpony's faction. Suspicious Nomad detachments trap the militia
   between a Texark army and themselves, and Cardinal Nauwhat defects to
   the Texark camp. One of Hadala's bodyguards, one of the Pope's Yellow
   Guards (elite Asian swordsmen), executes Hadala when he realizes that
   the cardinal has betrayed Brownpony. Blacktooth rejoins Brownpony, who
   elevates him to the position of Cardinal and sends him to New Rome to
   announce the coming of the crusaders.

   Blacktooth is seized by Texarks, who cast him into a New Rome dungeon.
   He eventually becomes aware of fires in the city, and is alerted to the
   fact that the Nomads have deserted Brownpony's cause and are sacking
   the city and countryside, while a Texark relief force approaches. He
   escapes the dungeon and falls into a drugged stupor, truly awakening in
   the damaged St. Peter's Cathedral, where he finds Brownpony and his
   last surviving bodyguard, Wooshin. Their reunion is disrupted by the
   arrival of a Nomad warrior, who informs them that the last loyal
   portions of the crusading army are departing. He warns them to flee,
   but Brownpony refuses and seats himself on the papal throne, the first
   Valana pope in decades to do so. When the Pope becomes aware of
   approaching Texark cavalry, he commits hara-kiri. Blacktooth stops
   Wooshin from joining him in the ritual act of suicide, and flees the
   approaching horsemen.

   Blacktooth renounces his cardinalship before meeting briefly with the
   new, Texark-sponsored Pope, who turns out to be none other than the
   defected Cardinal Nauwhat. Blacktooth learns that the Hannegan Filpeo
   Harq, too, is dead, assassinated in an act of self-sacrifice by the
   vengeful Wooshin. It is mentioned that Blacktooth lived out his days as
   a hermit, not far from where AEdrea, now called Sister Clare, lives in
   a nunnery.
