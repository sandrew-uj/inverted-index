   Thousands of years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil
   war between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus
   Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. The Autobots want to find
   the All Spark, the source of all Cybertronian life, so they can use it
   to rebuild Cybertron and end the war between the Autobots and the
   Decepticons, while the Decepticons want to use it to defeat the
   Autobots and conquer the universe. Megatron found the All Spark on
   Earth, but crash-landed in the Arctic Circle and was frozen in the ice.
   Captain Archibald Witwicky and his crew of explorers stumbled upon
   Megatron's body in 1897. Captain Witwicky accidentally activated
   Megatron's navigational system and his eye glasses were imprinted with
   the coordinates of the All Spark's location. Sector 7, a secret United
   States government organization, discovered the All Spark in the
   Colorado river and built the Hoover Dam around it to mask its energy
   emissions. The still-frozen Megatron was moved into this facility and
   was reverse engineered to advance human technology.

   In the present, the rest of the Decepticons--Blackout, Scorponok,
   Frenzy, Barricade, Starscream, Devastator and Bonecrusher--have landed
   on Earth and assumed the disguise of Earth vehicles. Blackout and
   Scorponok attack the U.S. SOCCENT FWD military base in Qatar and try to
   hack into the U.S. military network to find the location of Megatron
   and the All Spark. Their mission is thwarted when the base staff severs
   the network cable connections. While Blackout destroys the rest of the
   base, Scorponok chases a small group of survivors who have photographic
   evidence of the robots, but he is eventually repelled. During this
   battle, the military discovers its only effective weapons against the
   Transformers' armor are high-heat sabot rounds.

   After Blackout's failure, Frenzy infiltrates Air Force One to try again
   to hack into the military network, and in doing so plants a virus. He
   finds the map imprinted on Captain Witwicky's glasses, whose
   descendant, Sam Witwicky, intends to sell on eBay. Frenzy and Barricade
   begin tracking Sam's location. The Autonomous Robotic Organism
   (shortened to "Autobot") Bumblebee is also on Earth, disguised as a
   1976 Chevrolet Camaro, and is bought by Sam while shopping for his
   first car. Bumblebee helps him woo his crush, Mikaela Banes. Bumblebee
   leaves at night to transmit a homing signal to the rest of the Autobots
   and Sam sees him in robot mode. Barricade confronts Sam and demands
   Archibald's spectacles, but Bumblebee rescues him and Mikaela. After
   Bumblebee upgrades his vehicle form by scanning a 2006 Chevrolet
   Camaro, they leave to rendezvous with the rest of the Autobots: Optimus
   Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet--who have landed on Earth and taken
   the forms of Earth vehicles as well. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots
   return to Sam's home and obtain the glasses. Agents from Sector 7
   arrive and capture Sam, Mikaela and Bumblebee.

   Frenzy, disguised as a cellphone, secretly accompanies the group to
   Hoover Dam and releases Megatron from his frozen state. Locating the
   All Spark, Frenzy sends an alert to the other Decepticons. Sam
   convinces the Sector 7 agents to release Bumblebee so that he can get
   the All Spark to Optimus Prime. Frenzy's virus has shut down government
   communications, but a pair of hackers manage to establish a signal to
   the Air Force. The Autobot-human convoy goes to nearby Mission City to
   obtain a radio that will guide the Air Force's defense and secure a
   rendezvous point as a safe destination for All Spark. The Decepticons
   attack and Bonecrusher, Frenzy, Jazz, Devastator and Blackout are all
   killed during the ensuing battle, but Sam manages to ram the All Spark
   into Megatron's chest, killing Megatron and destroying the All Spark.
   Optimus takes a fragment of the All Spark from Megatron's corpse, but
   realizes that with its destruction, their home world Cybertron cannot
   be restored. Consequently, Optimus sends a signal to other surviving
   Autobots in the universe, directing them to their new home, Earth. The
   government orders the closure of Sector 7 and has the four Decepticons
   killed in Mission City battle dumped into the Laurentian Abyss.
   Starscream, who fled the battle, escapes into space.
