   In the distant past, the Celestial Paradise was the scene of a terrible
   uprising. A group of warrior angels, lovers of justice and freedom,
   challenged the tyranny of the powerful archangels, raising arms against
   their oppressors. Expelled, the renegades were forced into exile, and
   condemned to wander the world of men until the final judgement. But
   then comes the moment of Revelation, the time of reckoning, the day of
   the awakening of the Most High. Ablon, sole survivor of the purge and
   leader of the renegades, is invited by Lucifer, to join his legions in
   the battle of Armageddon, the final struggle between Heaven and Hell,
   the war that will decide not only the fate of the world, but the future
   of the universe. From the ruins of Babylon to the splendour of the
   Roman Empire, from the vast plains of China to the frozen castles in
   medieval England. A Batalha do Apocalipse is not just a journey through
   human history, but also a journey of knowledge, an exciting epic, full
   of heroic struggles, magic, romance and suspense.
