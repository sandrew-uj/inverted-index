   Max Jones works the family farm in the Ozark Mountains. With his father
   dead and his stepmother marrying again to a man he detests, Max runs
   away from home, taking his late uncle's astrogation manuals.

   Most occupations are tightly controlled by guilds with hereditary
   memberships. Since his uncle had been a member of the Astrogators'
   Guild and had had no children, Max hopes that before he died, his uncle
   had named him his heir. He begins hitchhiking towards Earthport to find
   out. Along the way, he finds a friendly face in hobo Sam Anderson, who
   later alludes to being a deserter from the Imperial Marines. Sam feeds
   Max and offers advice, though he later steals Max's valuable manuals.

   At the guild's headquarters, Max is disappointed to find that he had
   not been named as an heir, but he receives his uncle's substantial
   security deposit for his manuals. Max learns that Sam had returned the
   manuals and tried to claim the deposit for himself.

   By chance, he runs into an apologetic Sam. With Max's money, Sam is
   able to finagle them jobs aboard a starship using forged records of
   their service as crewmen aboard other starships. Max signs on as a
   steward's mate third class, and then he absorbs the contents of the
   Stewards' Guild manual using his eidetic memory. Among his duties is
   caring for several animals, including passengers' pets. When Eldreth
   "Ellie" Coburn visits her pet, an alien, semi-intelligent "spider
   puppy" that Max has befriended, she learns that he can play
   three-dimensional chess, and challenges him to a game. A champion
   player, she diplomatically lets him win. Meanwhile, Sam rises to the
   position of master-at-arms.

   When, through Ellie's machinations, the ship's officers discover that
   Max had learned astrogation from his uncle, Max is promoted to the
   command deck. Under the tutelage of Chief Astrogator Hendrix and Chief
   Computerman Kelly, he becomes a probationary apprentice chartsman, then
   a probationary astrogator. In a meeting with Hendrix, Max reluctantly
   admits to faking his record to get into space. Hendrix defers the
   matter until their return to Earth. The Asgard then departs for
   Halcyon, a colony planet orbiting Nu Pegasi.

   When Hendrix dies, the astrogation department is left dangerously
   shorthanded. The aging captain tries to take his place, but is not up
   to the task. When Max detects an error in his real-time calculations
   leading up to a transition, neither the captain nor Assistant
   Astrogator Simes believe him, and the ship becomes lost.

   They locate a habitable world, which Ellie names Charity, and the
   passengers become colonists. Meanwhile, the crew continues to try to
   figure out where they are and whether they can return to Earth.
   Unfortunately, it turns out the planet is already inhabited by hostile
   centaur-like sapients. Max and Ellie are captured, but Ellie's pet is
   able to guide Sam to them. They escape, though Sam is killed covering
   their retreat. Upon his return, Max is informed that the captain has
   died. Simes tried to take command illegally and was killed by Sam,
   leaving Max as the only remaining astrogator. To make matters worse,
   Simes hid or destroyed the astrogation manuals.

   Vastly outnumbered by the natives, the humans are forced to attempt a
   perilous return to known space by reversing the erroneous transition.
   Max must pilot the ship; he must also supply the missing astrogation
   tables from memory. To add to his burdens, the remaining officers
   inform Max that he must take command, as only an astrogator can be the
   captain. The pressure is immense, but Max succeeds and the ship returns
   to known space.

   Max pays heavy fines, but is allowed to join the Astrogators' Guild,
   and is assigned as an assistant astrogator aboard another starship.
   However, he loses any chance for a romantic relationship with Eldreth;
   she returns home to marry her boyfriend. Max accepts this with mixed
   feelings, but looks forward to his new career.
