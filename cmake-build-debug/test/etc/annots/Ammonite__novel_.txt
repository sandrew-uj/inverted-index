   Ammonite is the story of Marghe Taishan, an anthropologist and employee
   of a government agency, the Settlement and Education Councils (SEC).
   She is sent as an SEC representative to the planet Jeep (Grenchstom's
   Planet - "Jeep" being the pronunciation of the abbreviation "GP").
   Centuries in the past, Jeep was colonized by people from Earth, but
   contact was lost with the colony, and now the planet is a target for
   recolonization by the sinister Durallium Company (mostly referred to as
   "Company"). Some years prior to the beginning of the story, Company
   sent an expedition of technical and security personnel (the latter
   called "Mirrors" for the mirrored helmets on their combat armor) to the
   planet; a short time later, all of the men and many of the women in the
   expedition died from a virus, also known as Jeep, which was endemic to
   the planet. As a result, the planet was placed under quarantine, and
   none of the surviving members of the expedition have been allowed to
   leave. One of the mysteries of the planet is that there is a "native"
   population, entirely female and apparently descended from the original
   colony.

   Marge is sent to Jeep not only to study the native cultures, but also
   to test a potential vaccine for the Jeep virus. She makes a journey
   across Jeep, living with several of its indigenous cultures. Shortly
   after the start of her journey, she is captured and enslaved by the
   nomadic Echraidhe, one of whose members, Uaithne, believes herself to
   be the Death Spirit, the chosen representative of the goddess of death
   destined to bring about an apocalypse. Escaping the Echraidhe and
   almost dying in the extreme winter, she reaches the quieter village of
   Ollfoss, where she joins a family and stops taking the vaccine,
   accepting the virus into her body and truly learning what it is like to
   be a native (including how the natives are able to conceive children).
   She learns the mystic discipline of "deepsearch", and eventually
   becomes a "viajera", or traveling wise woman. Afterward, she is forced
   to the center of a conflict between the Mirrors and the Echraidhe under
   the leadership of Uaithne. Marghe stops the conflict, but shortly
   thereafter Company, believing the vaccine to have been a failure,
   destroys the space station orbiting Jeep, apparently isolating the
   people there. However, Marghe and the Mirrors believe that the Company
   will probably return one day, a return they must prepare for.

   Adaptation to life on Jeep appears to be a greater theme of Griffith's
   novel, as not only Marghe, but other Company personnel, also eventually
   are forced to settle on Jeep and adapt to the cultures that its prior
   colonists have created, in order to adjust to the planetary
   environment.
