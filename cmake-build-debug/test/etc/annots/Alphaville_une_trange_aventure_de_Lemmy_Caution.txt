   Lemmy Caution is a secret agent with the code number of 003 from "the
   Outlands". Entering Alphaville in his Ford Galaxie, he poses as a
   journalist named Ivan Johnson and claims to work for the Figaro-Pravda.
   Caution is on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing
   agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill
   the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly,
   he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60.
   Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun, which is
   in complete control of all of Alphaville.

   Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like
   love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with
   contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha
   60's dictates is that "people should not ask 'why', but only say
   'because'". People who show signs of emotion are presumed to be acting
   illogically and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed. In an
   image reminiscent of George Orwell's concept of Newspeak, there is a
   dictionary in every hotel room that is continuously updated when words
   that are deemed to evoke emotion become banned. As a result, Alphaville
   is an inhuman, alienated society.

   Images of the E = mc2 and hf = mc2 equations are displayed several
   times throughout the film as symbols of the regime of logical science
   that rules Alphaville. At one point, Caution passes through a place
   called the Grand Omega Minus, from where brainwashed people are sent
   out to the other "galaxies" to start strikes, revolutions, family rows,
   and student revolts.

   As an archetypal American anti-hero private eye in trenchcoat and with
   weathered visage, Lemmy Caution's old-fashioned machismo conflicts with
   the puritanical computer (Godard originally wanted to title the film
   Tarzan versus IBM). The opposition of his role to logic (and that
   of other dissidents to the regime) is represented by faux-quotations
   from Capitale de la douleur ("Capital of Pain"), a book of poems by
   Paul Eluard.

   Caution meets Dickson, who soon dies in the process of making love to a
   "Seductress Third Class". Caution then enlists the assistance of
   Natacha von Braun (Anna Karina), a programmer of Alpha 60 and daughter
   of Professor von Braun. Natacha is a citizen of Alphaville and when
   questioned, says that she does not know the meaning of "love" or
   "conscience". Caution falls in love with her, and his love introduces
   emotion and unpredictability into the city. Natacha discovers, with the
   help of Lemmy Caution, that she was actually born outside of
   Alphaville. (The city name is given as Nueva York--Spanish for New
   York--instead of either the original English name or the French literal
   rendering "Nouvelle York".)

   Professor von Braun (the name is a reference to the German rocket
   scientist Wernher von Braun) was originally known as Leonard
   Nosferatu (a tribute to F. W. Murnau's film Nosferatu), but Caution is
   repeatedly told that Nosferatu no longer exists. The Professor himself
   talks infrequently, referring only vaguely to his hatred for
   journalists, and offering Caution the chance to join Alphaville, even
   going so far as to offer him the opportunity to rule a galaxy. When he
   refuses Caution's offer to go back to "the outlands", Caution kills
   him.

   Alpha 60 converses with Lemmy Caution several times throughout the
   film, and its voice is seemingly ever-present in the city, serving as a
   sort of narrator. Caution eventually destroys or incapacitates it by
   telling it a riddle that involves something Alpha 60 can not
   comprehend: poetry (although many of Alpha 60's lines are actually
   quotations from the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges; the opening line
   of the film, along with others, is an extract of Borges's essay "Forms
   of a Legend", and other references throughout the movie are made by
   Alpha 60 to Borges's "A New Refutation of Time"). The concept of the
   individual self has been lost to the collectivized citizens of
   Alphaville, and this is the key to Caution's riddle.

   At the end, as Paul Misraki's musical score reaches its climax, Natacha
   realizes that it is her understanding of herself as an individual with
   desires that saves her, and destroys Alpha 60. The film ends with her
   line "Je vous aime" ("I love you").
