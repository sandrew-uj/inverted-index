   The Idylls of the Queen is set in the Britain of King Arthur, as
   portrayed by Sir Thomas Malory's classic Le Morte D'Arthur; as
   specifically stated by the author, no attempt is made at depicting with
   historical accuracy the time of the actual King Arthur. It expands an
   incident in Malory, in which the Queen is accused of murder, into a
   complex mystery novel mingling the genres of historical mysteries,
   Arthurian legend and fantasy. Although set in a magical world, the
   puzzle is unraveled through straight investigation with no sorcerous
   shortcuts.

   The obscure knight Sir Patrise is poisoned at a dinner party given by
   Queen Guenevere in Camelot, and Sir Mador, the dead knight's cousin,
   accuses the Queen of the murder. Her fate is to be determined through
   trial by combat. If the champion fighting on her behalf wins she will
   be declared innocent; if not, she will be burned at the stake.
   Unfortunately for her, the best Knights of the Round Table were all
   present at the dinner, which disqualifies them from championing her,
   and the mightiest of all, her secret lover Sir Lancelot, has gone
   missing.

   Guenevere's only hope is her admirer, King Arthur's sarcastic seneschal
   Sir Kay, the first-person narrator of the tale. Kay suspects that Sir
   Patrise's true killer had a more prominent target in mind, probably Sir
   Gawaine, and will likely try again; he is also cynical as to the
   efficacy of trial by combat in establishing anything other than which
   fighter is the better combatant. Therefore, playing the role of
   detective, he unites with Gawaine, Gareth and Morded in a two-pronged
   quest to locate the vanished Lancelot and unmask the real culprit.

   Kay investigates the recent actions and motivations of a number of the
   characters in the Arthurian stories, examining many of the suspects in
   techniques familiar to modern psychology, such as motivation, the
   background of the personality, etc. Various familiar names come under
   suspicion, and the author illuminates their characters in a fashion
   both insightful and true to their portrayals in medieval literature, if
   not always in Malory. For instance, Sir Kay's characterization harkens
   back as much to the heroic version of the early Welsh legends as it
   does to Malory's irascible boor, and Gawaine's more to the high-minded
   champion of Sir Gawaine and the Green Knight than the narrow and
   clannish bully of the Morte. Lancelot, meanwhile, is taken down more
   than a few pegs, while Morded, far from the stock villain so often
   seen, is gloomy, misunderstood, and surprisingly sympathetic. Others,
   such as Morgan le Fay and Sir Bors, are also presented in unique and
   insightful ways that provide arch sidelights on the standard legend.

   In the end, Guenevere is cleared, and justice of a sort prevails.

   The book ends with Sir Kay - who is himself deeply in love with the
   Queen, and bitterly jealous of Lancelot - sitting down to play chess
   with her, and contenting himself with at least having a deep though
   platonic relationship.
