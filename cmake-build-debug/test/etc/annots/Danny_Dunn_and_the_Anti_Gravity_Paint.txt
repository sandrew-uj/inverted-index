   Through a mishap in Professor Bulfinch's laboratory, Danny accidentally
   creates an anti-gravity paint. In time, the government constructs a
   spaceship which uses the paint as a propulsion system. The spaceship is
   launched prematurely after Danny and Joe follow Professor Bullfinch and
   Dr. Grimes on a tour of the ship. A mechanical failure dooms the four
   to a trip out of the Solar System unless they can repair the ship.
   Should they fail in this, they will drift too far from the Sun and
   freeze to death.
