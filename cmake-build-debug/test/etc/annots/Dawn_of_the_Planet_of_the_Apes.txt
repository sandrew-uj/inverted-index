   Ten years after the global pandemic of a deadly Simian Flu, the
   worldwide human population has been drastically reduced, with only
   about one in 500 genetically immune. Civilization is destroyed from the
   result of societal collapse. The apes, under the chimpanzee Caesar, all
   bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, have
   long-established a colony in the Muir Woods near San Francisco.

   A group of humans, led by a man named Malcolm, trespass the apes'
   territory from San Francisco in search of a hydroelectric dam that
   would restore power to the city. An encounter by Caesar's son Blue Eyes
   and his friend Ash leads to the latter's injury by a man named Carver.
   Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar orders the
   humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo with a vendetta
   against humans for his mistreatment as a laboratory test subject,
   Caesar brings his army to the humans' community as a display of
   strength. Caesar announces to the community that while the apes do not
   want war, he intends to fight the humans if he is forced to, while
   demanding the humans stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his
   fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the
   forest and reconcile with the apes so they can access the dam. He meets
   with Caesar, who allows them to work on the generator on the condition
   that they surrender their guns. As Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and his son
   Alexander work, they bond with the apes. The fragile bonding is greatly
   helped when Ellie, a nurse, effectively treats Caesar's wife Cornelia's
   illness.

   Dreyfus arms his community using the Fort Point armory. Koba discovers
   the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of loving humans more
   than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response, but refrains from killing
   him. Koba later returns to the armory and takes an assault rifle,
   killing two guards, and he secretly kills Carver after the humans
   succeed in repairing the generator and restoring power to the city.
   Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the
   apes' home. He then shoots Caesar, who falls into the underbrush below,
   and frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death in order to justify
   war. Koba quickly takes command and leads the ape army into San
   Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault
   on the human settlement. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes
   breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees
   underground. When Ash refuses Koba's orders to kill unarmed humans,
   citing Caesar's teachings, Koba throws him to his death and has any
   other ape who is loyal to Caesar imprisoned, including Maurice, Luca
   and Rocket.

   Malcolm's family find a severely wounded Caesar and transport him to
   his former house in San Francisco. When Malcolm sneaks back into the
   settlement to find medical supplies for Caesar, he encounters Blue
   Eyes, who spares him before learning that his father is still alive and
   accompanies Malcolm to find him. Caesar reveals that it was Koba who
   shot him, not the humans, and confesses that apes can be as corrupt and
   violent as humans. After reconciling with Caesar, Blue Eyes returns to
   the tower and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. Malcolm escorts the
   apes into the tower and then finds Dreyfus. He learns that the return
   of electricity allowed Dreyfus' men to make radio contact with
   survivors from a military base, who are now coming to fight the apes.
   Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower; as they fight, Dreyfus,
   who has initiated a suicide mission, detonates C-4 charges that
   destabilize the tower in a failed attempt to kill the apes. Koba starts
   angrily shooting at the apes, but Caesar tackles him from a ledge.
   While clinging on a metal girder, Koba is disowned as an ape by Caesar
   and dropped to his death.

   Malcolm and Caesar acknowledge their friendship, with Malcolm warning
   of the approaching human military. Caesar responds that the humans will
   never forgive the apes for their attack and convinces Malcolm to leave
   with his family. He then stands before a kneeling mass of apes,
   preparing for the upcoming war. After the credits, Koba is heard
   breathing after his fall.
