   In the present, a plague breaks out causing the infected to become
   zombies. The action starts 80 years later, where the western United
   States has devolved into a series of ghost towns overrun by zombies.
   The government awards bounty hunters bounties in exchange for pinkies
   of the undead.

   Ryn Baskin (Clint Glenn) is a bounty hunter. After a successful hunt,
   he is robbed and left for dead by a rival gang of hunters, led by
   Blythe Remington (Parrish Randall), who plans to spread the plague,
   creating a larger bounty market. Ryn survives and follows Remington
   with the aid of Hans Tubman (Nicola Giacobbe), a foreigner who had
   double crossed Ryn. This leads him to a final confrontation not
   just with Blythe, but with a huge zombie army.
