   Unlike the first books in the series, The Citadel of the Autarch picks
   up right after the end of the previous one, The Sword of the Lictor. It
   tells of the travels of Severian, weak and defenseless after his
   encounter with Baldanders and Dr. Talos. Severian continues his
   travels, which lead him into war.
