   At the start of the story, Youn Suu is a rookie Explorer on her first
   assignment in interstellar space. Like most Explorers, she suffers from
   a significant physical deformity--in her case, a facial blemish that
   has been left untreated to "qualify" her for the Explorer Corps. Her
   first assignment, with her partner Tut, is to investigate a sudden
   infestation of the Balrog in a domed city on the home world of the
   Cashlings. While there, she is herself infested by the red moss. At the
   same time, Youn Suu and Tut encounter Admiral Festina Ramos, present on
   a mission of her own.

   Aboard an Outward fleet starship, Youn Suu is monitored medically,
   though there is no cure for her condition and no real treatment. The
   Balrog, far more than a parasite, is a hive mind well above the human
   level of development, so that killing it would violate the central
   precept of the League of Peoples. As its symbiotic relationship with
   its human host develops, the Balrog comes to share the mental
   functioning of its host, and prolongs the host's life while consuming
   her body--"her" because the only prior human host was also female (and
   also a Buddhist). Youn Suu is also exposed to potential exploitation,
   by people who want to use the Balrog's special abilities for their own
   purposes. Meanwhile, Ramos and the other explorers are called to an
   emergency rescue on a planet called Muta, where Unity survey teams have
   suddenly disappeared, with barely a peep of a distress signal.

   The planet Muta, temperate and Earth-like, is to outward appearances
   almost ideal for colonization; yet colonizing efforts by the Unity, and
   the Greenstriders, and perhaps others, have mysteriously failed. The
   three Explorers land on the planet; even with the most elaborate
   precautions they fall prey to its peculiar circumstances, and find
   themselves stranded and contaminated with a microbe that threatens to
   destroy their bodies.

   Investigating their predicament, they learn that the entire planet was
   once a global research station for the Fuentes, a species that
   discovered a way to transcend the physical body and transform itself
   into energy-based or consciousness-based entities. The research done by
   the Fuentes on Muta 6500 years earlier had been in pursuit of that
   goal--but had gone horribly wrong, dooming Fuentes and Greenstrider and
   Unity individuals to a disembodied but tortuous existence. While being
   hunted by raptor-like reptiles, the three Explorers must find a way to
   repair alien technology to reverse the damage, before their own bodies
   collapse.
