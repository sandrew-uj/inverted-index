   The Colorado Army National Guard is called in to investigate a strange
   epidemic at ADX Florence. Its soldiers struggle to contain the disease
   before it overruns the United States, and search for a mysterious woman
   who may be vital to the solution.

   The novel begins with a mysterious woman in California being bitten on
   the street by a random man who walks up to her. She runs into the
   nearest establishment, an oxygen bar and proceeds to get high while
   waiting for the police to show up. The police arrive and take her to
   the hospital where a zombie outbreak is occurring. Although restrained,
   she manages to convince a nurse to let her go, who is then consumed by
   zombies.

   While this is occurring, we are also introduced to two additional
   characters, Captain Bannerman Clark and Dick Walters. Captain Bannerman
   Clark is in the Colorado Army National Guard and is the Rapid
   Assessment and Initial Detection Officer in Charge, making him the
   always ready first man on the scene of any major disaster, trained to
   get the best intelligence on the situation and report to others who
   will take over. He is called away from enjoying a steak dinner alone to
   investigate an outbreak of what is believed to be a biological weapon
   at a prison in Colorado which spread from the prisoners to the guards,
   causing them to become perceived cannibals. The warden of the prison
   had travelled to California and had succumbed to the biological agent
   there, biting and infecting a young woman. Clark then goes to
   California to assess the damage.

   Dick Walters is travelling in the rural areas of Colorado to check on
   an outbreak of an infectious agent in sheep. When he arrives at the
   farm, the woman he is there to visit greets him with a gun and surmises
   quickly he is not, "One of them." She takes him to an abandoned mine
   shaft where several zombies are trapped, zombies which ate her husband
   and young son. The pair spend the night on the roof of her cabin,
   waiting for the walkers to come.

   Clark and the woman meet for the first time when she walks out of the
   hospital he arrives at, besieged by zombies. She is thought to be one
   of them and is to be executed in front of him when she disappears,
   removing her own aura. The girl then decides, after seeing a vision of
   a man, to head east towards Colorado. She is picked up by two
   delinquents along the way and runs amok with them for a bit, seeing a
   disturbing scene in a small town where the village kills a zombie. They
   eventually bunker down for the night in a small, abandoned inn. The
   woman, calling herself Nilla after Nilla Wafers, is approached for sex
   by the man of the group, but he runs when he sees she is covered in
   mold. She runs into the forest nearby and kills a bear when attacked,
   turning the bear into one of the undead. The next morning the trio
   depart.

   Clark is determined to find Nilla after seeing her disappear, but his
   superiors force him to go to Washington to meet with and work for a
   civilian. The civilian likes Clark and intends on using him to figure
   all this out. Clark returns to Colorado to work on the cause of the
   disease and later transfers to Las Vegas for a short time as the West
   Coast is eventually overrun by zombies.

   Dick and his companion eventually come off the roof and go exploring in
   the night. The woman is attacked atop a hill and he runs, tripping on a
   rock and falling down the hill. He has a concussion and is attacked,
   first by the woman's dead sheep, slaughtered to control the disease and
   then the woman herself. When he is reanimated without arms, he is drawn
   towards the source, an area nearby which exudes life force. He is
   eventually recruited by a voice coming from the source to go on a
   mission. The voice guides him along the way.

   Nilla and her two friends leave the inn and go on, eventually stopping
   by a truck with two men in the back. The man goes and checks on the two
   and is bitten when it is revealed it is a zombie feasting on a corpse.
   The zombie is Dick and he is then tasked with following Nilla after she
   is abandoned by the woman and her dying boyfriend. Nilla continues on,
   psychically drawn to a house where she is met by a handicapped man who
   tells her she is the only one who can stop the source.
