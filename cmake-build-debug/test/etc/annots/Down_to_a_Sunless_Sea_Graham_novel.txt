   The story is told in the first person by Jonah Scott, a British pilot
   for the fictional airline Air Britain who has arrived in New York City
   on his regular flight from London. The United States has collapsed
   after using up nearly all of its oil reserves and the collapse of the
   dollar.

   During the night, Jonah and the apartment superintendent and guard,
   John Capel, must fight off armed burglars disguised as military police
   looking for the food Jonah and Senior Flight Attendant Kate Monahan
   brought with them. Capel is wounded but Kate demonstrates her basic
   medical skills in cleaning and dressing the wound. Jonah offers to help
   Capel and a newly orphaned girlfriend, Nikki, of one of his crew travel
   illegally to London aboard his aircraft, in order to escape the anarchy
   that has befallen America.

   Shortly after takeoff from New York, Jonah is informed that Israel has
   attacked Beirut, Damascus, and Cairo with nuclear weapons in
   retaliation for their radioactive poisoning of Tel Aviv's water supply.

   Israel's strike triggers a worldwide nuclear holocaust while the plane
   is en route to London, the Soviet Union and China attacking America and
   its allies. Four Soviet diplomats on board try to hijack the plane,
   only to be killed.

   Unable to continue to Europe due to the fact that it has suffered
   nuclear attack, or return to also-attacked New York, the crew attempt
   to find a place to land their plane. They are granted landing rights at
   Funchal, but its airport is destroyed by the collision of an El Al
   flight and a desperate pilot disobeying instructions.

   Jonah and his crew wonder whether to crash land on an island in the
   Azores chain with the help of Juan, a local resident who has contacted
   them via amateur radio. Jonah sights a NATO airfield, Lajes Field,
   which is mostly intact. Jonah and the nuclear scientists who are on
   board deduce that the Soviets needed Lajes intact and accordingly
   attacked it with a short-lived neutron bomb to occupy it. Jonah lands
   the plane at Lajes.

   Although safe for now, rising levels of fallout from Europe require
   that they evacuate, and they decide to fly to Antarctica. They are not
   sure how many passengers they can bring and how many supplies they will
   need to bring. Jonah and the SAS soldiers on board manage to
   re-activate the base radar and use the teletype machines to make
   contact with a sheltered-in-place British naval officer in the Falkland
   Islands who is able to break cover and confirm with the McMurdo
   Antarctic base the existence of sufficient provisions, plus a nuclear
   reactor for warmth. He dies quickly.

   A Soviet Antonov freighter aircraft lands at Lajes. Initially suspected
   of being a Soviet landing party to secure the crucial mid-Atlantic air
   force base, it turns out to be carrying two female Soviet Air Force
   crew and a large number of civilian refugees. Next morning both
   aircraft, fully fueled plus carrying as much extra fuel as possible,
   fly to Antarctica. When the Antonov cannot make the necessary altitude
   to overfly the worldwide belt of hot radiation (with the weight of
   cargo, passengers, and fuel), fifty Soviet volunteers sacrifice
   themselves by jumping from the plane.

   Soon after the characters arrive at McMurdo, it is realised that the
   tilt of the Earth on its axis is being affected by the numerous nuclear
   explosions. There are two different endings of Down To A Sunless Sea
   which suggest either a radioactive death for all the survivors with a
   theological twist, or minus the polar advance of radiation, a chance
   for the almost one thousand survivors to rebuild the world.
