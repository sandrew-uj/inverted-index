   Generations ago, religious people built a colony spaceship called
   Jehovah. A planet called Samaria was established. The colony ship,
   orbiting above, was able to provide supplies and services. These were
   accessed by genetically modified 'angels', who were the only ones
   capable of performing the right vocal tones.

   Over the generations, the concept of the ship was forgotten and it was
   believed Jehovah was an actual deity. Now factions of 'angels' fight
   against rebel forces called 'Jacobites'. The angels want to keep their
   power and the Jacobites wish to know the truth.
