   In the future, humanity uses time travel to construct Eternity, an
   organization "outside time" which aimed to improve human happiness by
   observing human history and, after careful analysis, directly making
   small actions that cause "reality changes", as well as to help
   establish trade between the various centuries to help those in most
   need. Its members, known as "Eternals" and by the roles they hold,
   prioritize the reduction of human suffering, at the cost of a loss to
   technology, art, and other endeavors which are prevented from existing
   when judged to have a detrimental effect. Those enlisted travel
   "upwhen" and "downwhen" and re-enter time in devices called "kettles".
   They are unable to travel to times before the 27th century, when the
   temporal field powering Eternity was established, which limit is known
   as the "downwhen terminus". Also, humanity's fate is unknown - the
   earth is empty by the 150,000th century, but this is preceded by a
   period called the Hidden Centuries from the 70,000th-150,000th
   centuries in which for unknown reasons they cannot access the world
   outside Eternity to learn more.

   Andrew Harlan is an Eternal and an outstanding Technician - a
   specialist at implementing reality changes - who is fascinated by the
   Primitive times. Senior Computer Laban Twissell, the Dean of the
   Allwhen Council, instructs Harlan to teach a newcomer, Brinsley
   Sheridan Cooper, about the Primitive. During this time, Harlan is also
   tasked by Assistant Computer Finge to spend a week in the
   482nd century. He stays with Noys Lambent, a non-Eternal member of the
   period's aristocracy, and falls in love with her. However, he discovers
   that a reality change is due to affect the century and, wishing to
   preserve Noys as she is, he breaks Eternal law and removes her from
   time, hiding her in the empty sections of Eternity that exist in the
   Hidden Centuries.

   Harlan later finds that the kettles will not travel to the time he hid
   Noys due to a mysterious block at the 100,000th century. He confronts
   Finge with a weapon, accusing him of sabotaging matters out of
   jealousy; but Finge states he has reported Harlan's conduct and denies
   placing the block. Harlan is summoned to the Council but is not
   reprimanded; he deduces that because his transgressions were ignored,
   he must be there to serve a larger purpose. Harlan confronts Twissell
   and explains that he has been teaching himself temporal mathematics and
   believes that its 23rd century inventor, Vikkor Mallansohn, must have
   been helped in his discovery by someone from his future; he concludes
   that his current role is training Cooper to do this. Twissell confirms
   this, adding that unknown to Cooper, Mallansohn's secret memoirs show
   that Cooper will take over Mallansohn's role and in effect, become
   Mallansohn. This must be kept from Cooper, so that Eternity will be
   founded as it historically was. Harlan blackmails Twissell by
   threatening to destroy Cooper's ignorance unless Noys is returned, but
   is outwitted; Twissell locks him in the control room with all controls
   deactivated other than the lever to send Cooper back - matching the
   memoir's statement that this was his role. Harlan, enraged, breaks open
   the controls and changes the power output, causing Cooper to be sent
   back to an unknown point estimated to be in the early 20th century.

   Twissell is aghast, but as Eternity still exists, he theorizes he can
   undo Harlan's damage, and send Cooper back correctly for his mission.
   They think Cooper might try to communicate using an advertisement in
   one of Harlan's Primitive magazines that would only stand out to an
   Eternal. Harlan finds a magazine from 1932 has changed, and now shows
   an advert in the form of a mushroom cloud, something no human could
   have known of in 1932. However, Harlan refuses to tell Twissell about
   the advertisement until they bring Noys back from the Hidden Centuries,
   though Twissell insists the block Harlan encountered is theoretically
   impossible. As the two travel far upwhen to discover what has happened,
   Twissell speculates that the Hidden Centuries might be a time when
   humans evolved into something greater, and that they may have blocked
   off that time - and placed the block at the 100,000th century - to
   prevent Eternity from interfering with them. Harlan and Twissell pass
   the 100,000th century unhindered and find Noys. Harlan then agrees to
   travel downwhen and bring back Cooper, so he can be sent to the correct
   time for his mission - but only if Noys comes with him.

   On arrival in 1932, Harlan holds Noys at gunpoint, revealing that he
   suspects her of being from the Hidden Centuries, and that he has
   brought her so that she could not harm Eternity. Noys acknowledges she
   is from that time, and explains that her people had also developed time
   travel but their method shows many possible futures rather than just
   one future as seen by Eternity. They learned that humans would have
   been the first species to spread into the universe, but in each future
   where Eternity existed, safety was given a priority and by the time
   humans reached the stars, other species predominated and prevented
   this. As a result, humanity would become depressed and gradually die
   out. Noys' mission was to make the minimum change to history to remedy
   this - to prevent Eternity from ever being founded. There were multiple
   ways of achieving this, and she chose an approach in which she and
   Harlan were together. Noys gives Harlan the choice of killing her and
   preserving Eternity, or letting her live and allowing a different
   future to arise. Harlan, remembering the unhealthy interpersonal
   relationships between the Eternals, and the sociological damage he has
   seen done to people whose original "homewhen" had ceased to exist,
   begins to agree with her. Suddenly, a reality change occurs; the kettle
   disappears, indicating that Eternity now never happened. The book ends
   by stating that this was "the end of Eternity - and the beginning of
   Infinity".
