   In 3028, humanity has mastered deep space travel and interacted with
   several alien species. A human invention called "Project Titan" alarms
   the Drej, a pure energy-based alien species. As the Drej commence
   attacking Earth, Professor Sam Tucker, the lead researcher for "Project
   Titan", sends his son Cale on one of the evacuation ships with his
   alien friend Tek while Tucker and other members of his team fly the
   Titan spacecraft into hyperspace. The Drej mother ship arrives and
   fires a directed-energy weapon into Earth that completely destroys the
   planet, while debris from the explosion also destroys the Moon. The
   surviving humans become nomads, generally ridiculed by other alien
   species.

   Fifteen years later, Cale works at the salvage yard in an asteroid belt
   called Tau 14. Joseph Korso, captain of the spaceship Valkyrie, tracks
   him down and reveals that Tucker encoded a map to the Titan in the ring
   he gave Cale. Tek tells Cale that humanity depends on finding the
   Titan. When the Drej attack the salvage yard, Cale escapes aboard the
   Valkyrie with Korso and his crew: Akima Kunimoto, a human female pilot,
   along with Preed, Gune, and Stith, aliens of various species.

   On the planet Sesharrim, the Gaoul interpret the map, and discover the
   Titan hidden in the Andali Nebula. Drej fighters arrive, capturing Cale
   and Akima. The Drej eventually discard Akima and extract the Titan's
   map from Cale. Korso's crew rescues Akima, while Cale eventually
   escapes in a Drej ship, and rejoins the group. Cale's map has changed
   and now shows the Titan's final location.

   While resupplying at a human space station called New Bangkok, Cale and
   Akima discover that Korso and Preed are planning to betray the Titan to
   the Drej. Cale and Akima manage to escape the Valkyrie, but they are
   stranded on New Bangkok when Korso and the remaining crew set off for
   the Titan. Assisted by New Bangkok's colonists, Cale and Akima salvage
   a small spaceship named Phoenix and race to find the Titan before Korso
   does.

   Cale and Akima navigate through the ice field in the Andali Nebula and
   dock with the Titan before the Valkyrie arrives. They discover DNA
   samples of Earth animals, and a pre-recorded holographic message left
   by Professor Tucker who explains that the Titan was designed to create
   an Earth-like planet. However, because it escaped from the Earth's
   destruction by jumping to hyperspace, its power cells lack the energy
   necessary for the process. After Korso and Preed arrive, interrupting
   the message, Preed reveals his alliance with the Drej and betrays Korso
   while holding him, Cale, and Akima at gunpoint. Preed attempts to kill
   them, but Korso snaps his neck, killing him. He and Cale then fight
   until Korso falls into the depths of the ship.

   Moments later, the Drej attack the Titan. Because Drej are,
   essentially, beings of pure energy, Cale realizes that modifying the
   Titan to absorb them will re-energize the ship. Unfortunately, in order
   to implement this plan, Cale must repair a malfunctioning circuit
   breaker; he sets off to do this while the remaining crew of the
   Valkyrie distract the aliens. Korso, who survived and overheard Cale's
   plan, shows up and helps stall the Drej and then sacrifices himself to
   complete the repairs. The Titan absorbs the Drej mothership along with
   everything and everyone aboard to gain power, with the Drej suffering a
   fate worse than death. Using this gained power, along with the ice
   field, a new, habitable planet is generated.

   Cale and Akima stand in the rain, gazing at their beautiful new home
   and discuss what this planet should be called. Stith and Gune bid Cale
   and Akima farewell before flying off on the Valkyrie just as colony
   ships, filled with humans anxious to start life anew, approach.
