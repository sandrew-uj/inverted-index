   The CVN news network's nightly program, starring Don Tobin (Watson),
   with reports from correspondents Michael Boyle (Glenn) and Dorian
   Waldorf (Shaver), discusses a terrorist bombing of the American embassy
   in Saudi Arabia that killed the American ambassador. The week before, a
   global banking crisis, caused by several South American countries
   defaulting on their loans, led to turmoil in Southwest Asia. Before the
   unrest spread to Saudi Arabia, Soviet-backed militants led a coup in
   Oman when the Omani economy collapsed. Shortly after, a new report
   shows the banking crisis may soon begin to ease.

   During this time, Waldorf's Pentagon insider boyfriend is providing
   off-the-record insight into the White House's response to all these
   events, and suggests that there may be too many critical events going
   on at once for the President and his advisers to handle effectively.

   The following day, it is revealed that a large military operation was
   launched to keep the peace in Saudi Arabia, with many American
   soldiers, ships, and planes being sent at King Fahd's request. This
   move is heavily criticized - in the US and abroad. The United Kingdom,
   America's closest ally, refuses to take part in the operation as do
   many other of America's allies. However the attitude of the American
   representatives is clear that they can perform the peacekeeping mission
   alone, citing the success of the British in the past in containing the
   Soviets' previous provocation in the area.

   In response to this move, which the Soviet Union sees as provocative,
   the Soviet-backed puppet government in Oman imposes a $10,000 toll for
   every oil tanker passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian
   Gulf. The Soviet government claims it will remove the toll if the
   Americans withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia. The captains of the
   tankers refuse to pay the toll, effectively creating an economic
   blockade in which no oil can be transported through the Persian Gulf.

   A breaking news alert on the fifth day of the Middle East crisis
   reveals that a short battle took place between American warplanes and
   unidentified enemy warplanes, presumed to be from Iran or Kuwait, in
   which an American reconnaissance plane was shot down over the Persian
   Gulf before two of the five attacking planes were shot down. The
   attacking aircraft were presumably aiming for an oil refinery in Ras
   Tanura in retaliation for Saudi Arabia's request for American troops.

   Meanwhile, Waldorf brings a story to CVN: her boyfriend had provided
   her with satellite photos that suggests that Soviet forces have
   disappeared from their border with the Middle East, possibly as a
   covert invitation to mutually withdraw from the area -- an invitation
   that could have been ignored in the flood of information the multiple
   global crises have created ("The signal-to-noise ratio in there [The
   White House] is horrendous."). However, Tobin reluctantly insists that
   Waldorf have more than one source for the story.

   On day six of the crisis, an American aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz
   and its battle group, armed with both nuclear and conventional weapons,
   are sent by the U.S. President to the Persian Gulf to ensure the free
   passage of oil tankers in the region; the President also activates
   Selective Service, drafting thousands of soldiers in anticipation of a
   larger conflict. The Soviet Union quickly responds to this action by
   sending submarines to the Persian Gulf. CVN sends Michael Boyle to the
   Nimitz to cover the deployment. The Soviets publicly criticize the
   United States for failing to accept their offers of conciliation and
   mutual withdrawal from the area, implying that Waldorf's information
   was correct and that the US may have given up an opportunity for a
   peaceful solution.

   On day eight of the crisis, in response to the growing urgency of the
   situation, CVN begins to broadcast 24 hours a day. Shortly after a
   State Department briefing, the Defense Secretary dies, perhaps of a
   heart attack brought on by the stresses of crisis management.

   On day nine, the crisis deepens when an Omani gunboat attacks and
   apparently destroys an unarmed Dutch vessel which tried to go through
   the Strait of Hormuz. The CVN broadcast also notes the presence of
   Soviet attack submarines near the site of the attack. At this
   point, people begin to evacuate cities, overseas air travel is
   suspended by the FAA, many American schools begin closing, the
   Strategic Air Command redeploys B-52 bombers throughout the nation's
   airports, and people are urged to stay off their phones. By nightfall,
   an evacuation of the White House is ordered, and the US begins shutting
   down its nuclear power plants nationwide, an act noted not to have
   happened since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Later, Waldorf is met by her
   boyfriend at the news studio, offering to take her along in the
   evacuation--the President has delegated tactical nuclear launch
   authority to the Nimitz battle group commander after the destruction of
   the Dutch vessel, and the chances of a nuclear exchange in the Gulf
   have increased significantly. Waldorf chooses to remain in Washington
   to continue her work.

   A night battle then erupts between Omani gunboats and the U.S. Navy in
   the Strait of Hormuz, with an Omani gunboat firing first and disabling
   an American warship, then subsequently being destroyed. Despite the
   gravity of the situation, Tobin discusses his optimistic viewpoint of
   the situation with correspondent Eric Sevareid, believing that
   "easonable people, once they've looked the Devil in the face, aren't
   going to shake hands with him."

   Shortly after the Omani gunboat exchanges fire with the American ship,
   a Soviet submarine slips through the perimeter of American ships and is
   tracked towards the Nimitz, which begins exploding depth charges
   towards the submarine. There is suddenly a large, underwater nuclear
   detonation, suggesting that a nuclear depth bomb was detonated to stop
   the sub. Boyle evacuates into the carrier's island, confronting an
   officer to find out who provided authorization for the nuclear attack,
   but cannot get a clear answer. Shortly thereafter, a nuclear weapon[N
   2] detonates inside the battle group, causing an unknown level of
   damage, yet apparently not sinking the Nimitz. Shortly thereafter,
   Boyle and the Nimitz lose contact with CVN.

   At this point, the White House is completely evacuated, with the
   President, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other White House officials
   evacuated onto the National Emergency Airborne Command Post plane with
   the Strategic Air Command's airborne command center Looking Glass in
   accompaniment, and the Emergency Broadcast System is activated.

   In the moments before CVN's broadcast is transferred over to the
   Emergency Broadcast System, Tobin reiterates his optimism, discussing
   the opinions of a deceased colleague who was considered an expert in
   nuclear war scenarios. His colleague held the belief that a nuclear
   exchange would someday take place, but when the two superpowers were
   confronted with the horror of the situation, they would choose peace
   over war. As a now-bewildered Tobin prepares to turn things over to the
   EBS, it is obvious that he is shaken by the events that have occurred,
   and is, moreover, almost mournfully fearful over the inescapable
   realization that both mankind and the planet Earth may very well have
   no future at all.
