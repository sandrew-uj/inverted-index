   Four high-contrast black-and-white images in sequence. In the first, a
   man, facing left with his right arm aloft, marches with a crowd towards
   a group of gun-wielding figures. In the second, uniformed figures are
   taking the man away amongst a crowd. In the third, the man is seen from
   behind at the bottom, with a group seated behind a bench in the
   distance near the top in an apparent courtroom. A crucifix hangs
   prominently above the bench, bathed in light in the darkened room. In
   the fourth, the man has his back to a wall, hands bound behind him,
   with another figure lying apparently dead at his feet. He faces right,
   apparently awaiting his execution by gunfire.
   Frans Masereel, 25 Images of a Man's Passion, 1918. Eisner was inspired
   by wordless novels of the 1920s and 1930s.

   Will Eisner was born in New York in 1917 to poor Jewish
   immigrants. He has said he wanted a career in the arts, but that
   poor Jews at the time were restricted from upper-class universities
   where he could study it. Like others of his generation, he turned to
   comics as an artistic outlet, a career he began in 1936. In the
   late 1930s he co-owned a studio which produced content for comic books;
   he left the studio in 1940 to produce his best-known creation, the
   formally inventive The Spirit, which ran as a newspaper insert from
   1940 to 1952. After its end, Eisner withdrew from the comic book
   world and focused on the American Visuals Corporation, which he had
   founded in 1948 to produce educational and commercial comics and
   related media. With the rise of comics fandom in the 1970s, Eisner
   found there was still interest in his decades-old Spirit comics, and
   that the fans wanted more work from him. After American Visuals went
   out of business in 1972, Eisner entered a deal with underground comix
   publisher Denis Kitchen to reprint old Spirit stories. Other reprints
   followed, but Eisner was unwilling to do new Spirit stories--instead,
   he wanted to do something more serious, inspired in part by the
   wordless novels of Lynd Ward he first read in 1938, and similar
   work by the Flemish Frans Masereel and the German Otto Nueckel.

   Eisner had had greater artistic ambitions for comics since his time
   doing The Spirit. Since the 1950s, he had been developing ideas for a
   book, but was unable to gain support for them, as comics was seen by
   both the public and its practitioners as low-status entertainment; at a
   meeting of the National Cartoonists Society in 1960, Rube Goldberg
   rebuked Eisner's ambitions, saying, "You are a vaudevillian like the
   rest of us ... don't ever forget that!"

   With the critical acceptance of underground comix in the 1970s, Eisner
   saw a potential market for his ideas. In 1978, he produced his first
   book-length, adult-oriented work, A Contract with God. He marketed it
   as a "graphic novel"--a term which had been in use since the 1960s, but
   was little known until Eisner popularized it with Contract. Though
   it was a modest commercial success, Eisner was financially independent,
   and soon set to work on another graphic novel Life on Another
   Planet, and completed eighteen further graphic novels before his
   2005 death; two featured the autobiographical Willie from the
   story "Cookalein": The Dreamer (1986) and To the Heart of the Storm
   (1991).
   I can't attribute the pattern of my life to the hand of God, although I
   would like to because it would seem that somewhere there is a hand that
   is guiding it. That would be a great comfort. But I can't find any
   reason to it.

   Will Eisner

   Eisner was brought up in a religious household, but himself was a
   reluctant disbeliever. In 1970, his sixteen-year-old daughter
   Alice died after an eighteen-month battle with leukemia. Eisner
   was enraged, and questioned how a God could let such a thing happen; he
   dealt with his grief by immersing himself in his work. When
   working on "A Contract with God", he tried to capture these emotions by
   acting out Frimme Hersh's character in his head.
