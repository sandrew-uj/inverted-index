   By the year 2056, an epidemic of organ failures has devastated the
   planet. The megacorporation GeneCo provides organ transplants on a
   payment plan. Clients who miss payments are hunted down by Repo Men,
   skilled assassins who "repossess" the organs (Genetic Repo Man). The
   CEO of GeneCo, Rottissimo "Rotti" Largo, discovers he is terminally
   ill. Rotti's three children, Luigi, Pavi, and Amber, bicker over who
   will inherit GeneCo (Mark It Up). Rotti believes none of his children
   are worthy heirs and instead plans to pass on his fortune to
   17-year-old Shilo Wallace, the daughter of his ex-fiance Marni (Things
   You See In A Graveyard).

   Shilo has inherited a rare blood disease from Marni which requires her
   to stay indoors, and longs to see the outside world (Infected). Shilo's
   overprotective father Nathan believes he killed Marni with a treatment
   he created for her illness - in truth, Rotti poisoned Marni's medicine
   behind Nathan's back as revenge for leaving him, and then blackmailed
   Nathan, promising to keep him out of jail if he agreed to become
   GeneCo's head Repo Man, though he has led Shilo to believe he is a
   doctor (Legal Assassin). One night, Shilo secretly visits her mother's
   tomb and runs into GraveRobber, who is digging up bodies to secrete
   Zydrate, a euphoric and addictive pain-killer that he sells on the
   street to keep up with his GeneCo payments (21st Century Cure).

   Rotti lures Shilo to GeneCo's fair with the promise of a cure for her
   disease. There, the Largo brothers argue about their father's will
   while Amber harasses Blind Mag, an opera singer and GeneCo's celebrity
   spokesperson. Born blind, Mag has been given surgically enhanced eyes
   by GeneCo at the cost of working for them indefinitely. Rotti explains
   that Mag is soon resigning as GeneCo's spokeswoman. GraveRobber helps
   Shilo escape the fairgrounds, encountering several of his customers
   including the surgery-addicted Amber, who has skipped the fair she was
   supposed to speak at, once again publicly embarrassing her father
   (Zydrate Anatomy). Amber explains that Mag's eyes are set for
   repossession and that she will replace her. After GeneCops arrive,
   GraveRobber and Shilo part ways and she quickly returns to her room
   before Nathan notices her missing.

   Rotti hires Nathan to repossess Mag's eyes but Nathan refuses, citing
   her close friendship with Marni, and quits his job mid-surgery (Night
   Surgeon). An infuriated Rotti vows to have Nathan taken out. Mag visits
   Shilo and reveals she is her godmother, and that Nathan had told her
   Shilo died with Marni. She cautions Shilo to not make the same mistakes
   she did (Chase The Morning). Nathan arrives home and forces Mag out
   after she scolds him for his lies and his incarceration of Shilo
   (Everyone's A Composer). Meanwhile, back at GeneCo, Rotti writes his
   will, ready to make Shilo his sole beneficiary (Gold).

   Rotti invites Shilo to the Opera (At The Opera Tonight). Nathan is
   pursued by GeneCops who try to arrest him, but he quickly dispatches
   them and heads to the opera looking for Shilo. Amber takes the stage
   for her debut, but her performance is ruined when her transplanted face
   falls off. Mag completes her final performance, but deviates from the
   song's grand finale, denouncing the Largo family and gouging out her
   eyes in an act of defiance (Chromaggia). Rotti cuts the cords
   suspending Mag, impaling her on a fence. Rotti assures the audience
   that Mag's death is part of the show.

   Shilo sees a Repo Man arrive and attacks him with a shovel before
   realizing that he is her father, and angrily confronts Nathan for lying
   to her about his profession (Let The Monster Rise). Onstage, Rotti
   reveals that Shilo does not have a blood disease but that Nathan has
   been poisoning her "medicine" in an attempt to keep her safe from the
   outside world after being unable to cope with the loss of Marni. As his
   disease begins to take its toll, Rotti promises Shilo GeneCo if she
   kills her father. When she refuses, Rotti uses the last of his strength
   to fatally shoot Nathan, and dies after disowning his children. After a
   tearful farewell to her father (I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much),
   Shilo leaves, deciding that her father's actions do not dictate her
   future (Genetic Emancipation).

   Shilo flees, leaving GeneCo with no legal heir. Amber inherits the
   company instead and auctions her fallen face to charity, which Pavi
   wins.
