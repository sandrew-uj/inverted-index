   Several years after a rapture-like event in which millions of people
   worldwide suddenly vanish without explanation, the citizens of
   Mapleton, Ohio are still struggling to cope with the massive loss and
   resulting culture shift. The story is told episodically, revolving
   around the four members of the Garvey family, who have each begun an
   unlikely relationship following the event.

   Kevin Garvey - The patriarch of the Garvey family, Kevin is a prominent
   local businessman enjoying early retirement during the event.
   Afterwards, he is compelled to run for mayor of Mapleton to replace the
   psychologically compromised incumbent. Kevin stresses the importance of
   returning to normality as a way for the survivors to cope through
   initiatives like survivors' mixers and adult recreation leagues. The
   other major policy of his tenure in office is an effort to ease tension
   between the town and the Guilty Remnant (GR), an ascetic religious
   group that aims to provoke people into remembering the losses of the
   event and how meaningless life is. Following a violent conflict between
   police and the GR, Kevin has taken a hands off approach to their
   existence, preferring to ignore them entirely.

   Kevin's wife leaves him to join the Guilty Remnant and he struggles to
   balance raising his daughter actively with respecting her privacy while
   she deals with the event and the breaking up of the Garvey family. He
   also finds he is unable to sustain new relationships with women, making
   a few failed attempts. Kevin develops a relationship with Nora Durst, a
   woman who has become quasi famous in Mapleton for losing her husband
   and both children in the event. Nora suffers a major depressive episode
   following the loss of her family, obsessively watching her children's
   favorite TV show, avoiding the holidays, and riding her bike for hours
   at a time. Nora is dealt a further blow when the town pastor, who has
   become a muckraking amateur journalist to reconcile how the event may
   have invalidated his own beliefs, publishes a tract that reveals Nora's
   husband had been carrying on an affair with her children's much younger
   preschool teacher.

   Kevin and Nora connect at a mixer after Nora confronts her former
   husband's mistress. Nora finds she has more sympathy than she expected
   with the woman over their mutual frustration with her husband's
   emotional distance and manipulation. Nora pursues Kevin, who is
   hesitant, but impulsively agrees to take a trip to Florida with her.
   Afterwards they settle into a relationship, but Nora is bothered that
   she does not feel like the `good girlfriend' she was always proud of
   being in college. Their burgeoning relationship falls apart on
   Valentine's Day when Kevin breaks one of the conventions of their
   arrangement by sharing personal feelings about his family, which makes
   Nora uncomfortable. She leaves him at the restaurant when he goes to
   the restroom.

   Kevin is served divorce papers by his wife, and realizes that his
   daughter is in danger of not graduating high school. He has fallen into
   a domestic routine with his daughter's friend, Aimee, who has been
   living with them, drinking coffee together in the morning before they
   both go to work. Kevin is alarmed at the increasing flirtation between
   them, culminating that Spring. He resolves to avoid being alone with
   Aimee to suspend the flirtation. The Spring softball league begins and
   even though his team is short handed Kevin plays anyway. He finds great
   satisfaction in the game and his ability to handle a fly ball, even in
   adverse conditions.

   Nora decides to leave Mapleton and adopt a new identity. She bleaches
   her hair but finds it's difficult to completely shed her identity when
   it comes time to sell her house. She writes a letter to leave for
   Kevin, explaining why she ran from him. In it, she is finally able to
   admit her ambivalence towards her family at the exact moment they
   disappeared, which had been a troubling source of guilt and anger.
   Opting to hand deliver the letter instead of mail it Nora discovers an
   infant left on the Garvey doorstep, instantly bonding with the child
   just as Kevin returns from his game.

   Laurie Garvey - Kevin's wife. Laurie is a new recruit in the Guilty
   Remnant, a religious group she was initially skeptical of, but is
   recruited to after her best friend joins. The GR are mute, wear all
   white, must always smoke in public, and stage silent confrontations
   with the people of Mapleton. Their goal is to remind everyone that they
   have been left behind in the event, and prevent the resumption of the
   status quo. After Laurie's integration into the group she is assigned a
   trainee, Meg. Meg is younger and less emotionally stable than Laurie,
   frequently remembering the wedding she had been planning before joining
   the GR. The two form a strong friendship and perform their GR duties,
   following around townspeople and confronting people from their former
   lives. Meg must confront her former fiance, who she is distressed to
   learn has begun new relationships and seems to have resumed his old
   life. Laurie is asked to serve her husband divorce papers to gain
   access to half of the family assets, because this is how the GR can
   afford to maintain operations. On Christmas Meg and Laurie visit Kevin.
   He treats them like regular holiday visitors, and before they leave
   gives Laurie the gift their daughter left for her, a lighter. Touched
   by the gift Laurie uses the lighter once, but then must throw it out to
   remain within the tenets of the GR.

   Laurie and Meg are "promoted" to live in an outpost, a four-person
   dwelling that provides many of the comforts they lost living in Guilty
   Remnant dorms, like privacy, better food, a hot tub, soft beds and less
   supervision. At first they are worried that living with the two men who
   already occupy the house will cause conflict and sexual tension, but
   the men are revealed to be in a secret romantic relationship and their
   personalities mesh well. One of the men is murdered while on their GR
   rounds, a troubling trend among the Remnant who resist all police
   investigation. Laurie's daughter, Jill, comes across the scene shortly
   after the murder and we learn that the GR has enacted a program in
   which one outpost member is commanded to kill the other as a sacrament.

   Laurie and Meg grow closer living in the outpost alone, sharing the
   same bed and developing a nonsexual although romantic domestic union.
   The day comes when a new pair is introduced into the outpost, signaling
   the end of Laurie and Meg's time together. Laurie holds a gun to Meg's
   head but is unable to pull the trigger, even with Meg's encouragement
   that she will be delivered by the act. Meg takes the gun and shoots
   herself, which Laurie sees as a final act of love. Collecting the gun
   Laurie is whisked away by a Guilty Remnant car, leaving town.

   Jill Garvey - Kevin and Laurie's daughter, a senior in high school who
   was smart and hardworking but is struggling in the post-rapture world,
   especially since her mother left the house to join the Guilty Remnant.
   Jill's new friend, Aimee, has moved into the house because she cannot
   live with her stepfather after her mother disappeared in the event.
   Aimee, also a senior, dresses provocatively and often encourages Jill
   to skip school and experiment (smoke weed, sex, etc.). The two attend
   regular parties at another teen's house, which always culminate in a
   variation of spin the bottle that pairs up the partygoers for random
   sexual encounters. The two girls carry on like this but find
   satisfaction in a happy "normal" Christmas spent exchanging gifts with
   Kevin. Kevin encourages the girls to resume their neglected educations;
   Jill agrees but Aimee decides to drop out to become a waitress. With
   Aimee more preoccupied with her job, Jill doesn't find the same amount
   of distraction when going to the same parties. She resolves that Aimee
   was the catalyst that made these events work with her talent for
   pushing things forward. Jill is distraught to learn that Laurie did not
   keep the lighter Jill got her for Christmas. She attends her last party
   and leaves early, opting to cut across a railyard instead of taking a
   ride from a set of twins Aimee is friends with. In the railyard Jill
   discovers the corpse of a GR member who she does not know had been her
   mother's housemate.

   That spring Jill has a chance encounter with one of her favorite
   teachers who is now a member of the GR. Under the guise of helping Jill
   with school work, she is invited to attend a "sleep over" at the GR
   compound. Jill anticipates the stay and possibly seeing her mother
   again, packing her bags. Meanwhile, Aimee's relationship with Kevin has
   become blurred and threatens to turn sexual. Aimee resolves to move out
   rather than escalate things with Kevin. Jill leaves for the GR compound
   without her father's knowledge, but on the way runs into the twins
   again, who invite her to play ping pong. She agrees and is hopeful that
   one of the twins seems to like her, realizing that in that moment she
   is happy.

   Tom Garvey - The older of the two Garvey children, Tom is in college
   during the event. He returns home after all the schools shut down in
   the aftermath and drinks every night at the local bar, sharing news
   that trickles back of who had been taken. School resumes and Tom joins
   a fraternity which somewhat deifies one of their disappeared brothers.
   He becomes uninterested in school. One of his fraternity brothers
   reveals the fallacy of their fraternity's hero, and together they
   stumble across a New Age movement in which a man claims he can absorb
   the pain of others through hugs. Tom becomes wholly invested in the
   movement and climbs in the ranks, moving all over the country and
   cutting off almost all contact with his family. In San Francisco the
   movement takes on cultish overtones that trouble Tom. He remains
   faithful to Holy Wayne, the group's leader, but is marginalized when he
   questions some new aspects of the group.

   It is discovered that Holy Wayne has "spiritually married" a number of
   underage Asian girls and is being brought up on criminal charges. The
   "brides" are sent into hiding and Tom is tasked with transporting one
   of them, Christine, across the country to Boston. They must travel in
   secret because Christine is pregnant and concrete proof of the charges
   against Wayne. In turn the group, including Christine, believes she is
   carrying the son of God.

   Tom and Christine disguise themselves as members of a free love
   movement, the Barefoot People, and travel by foot and bus across
   country. They become close friends and easily fall into their cover
   story of a romantically linked couple. On a bus trip they accidentally
   convert a soldier into a Barefoot person, a group they don't actually
   belong to. Arriving in Boston is a disappointment to Tom, who now has
   to share Christine with the Holy Wayne couple that has been charged
   with overseeing the delivery of their Messiah. Tom enjoys spending time
   in the contemplative Barefoot People community and maintains his cover.
   Shortly before Christine delivers her child, a girl, Holy Wayne admits
   guilt and repents for his crimes. The Holy Wayne community is
   shattered, and Christine is despondent.

   Christine wants to return home to Ohio because she doesn't know what
   else to do, and Tom takes her. He plans on stopping off in Mapleton to
   see his family again, hoping that it will encourage Christine, who has
   little interest in her daughter. At a rest stop Tom forces Christine to
   interact with her child, but when he leaves them to use the restroom
   she abandons Tom and her child to join a group of Barefoot People. Tom
   takes the baby with him to Mapleton and is surprised to see the town
   has not changed in his absence. He leaves the baby on his father's
   doorstep, knowing she will be well looked after, and leaves to pursue
   Christine and a life as a Barefoot Person.
