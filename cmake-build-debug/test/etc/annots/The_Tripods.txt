   The story of The Tripods is a variation on post-apocalyptic literature,
   wherein humanity has been enslaved by "Tripods" -- gigantic
   three-legged walking machines, piloted by unseen alien entities (later
   identified as "Masters"). Human society is largely pastoral, with few
   habitations larger than villages, and what little industry exists is
   conducted under the watchful presence of the Tripods. Lifestyle is
   reminiscent of the Middle Ages, but small artifacts from the Modern Age
   are still used, such as watches.

   Humans are controlled from the age of 14 by implants called "Caps,"
   which suppress curiosity and creativity. Some people, whose minds are
   broken by the Caps, become vagrants. According to The City of Gold and
   Lead, Masters begin to believe that humans should be capped at an
   earlier age "because some humans, in the year or two before they are
   Capped, become rebellious and act against the masters", but this cannot
   be done, because Capping must wait until the braincase has stopped
   growing.
