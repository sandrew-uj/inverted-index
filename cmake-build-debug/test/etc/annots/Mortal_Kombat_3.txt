   Weary of continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who lost to
   Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament in the previous game, enacts a
   10,000-year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang
   Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young
   age. However, she would not be revived in the Outworld, but in
   Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and
   reclaim his queen. When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn
   reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her, and as a result,
   Earthrealm gradually becomes a part of Outworld, stripping billions of
   their souls. Only a few are spared, protected by Raiden. He tells them
   that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his
   status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged
   with Outworld. Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to kill any
   Earthrealm survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the
   soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the
   extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. With his final defeat, every
   human on Earthrealm is restored.

   The game also contains several subplots:
     * Having defeated Shao Kahn in Outworld, Liu Kang now finds himself
       as the prime target of Shao Kahn's extermination squads. In
       response to the upcoming threat, he aligns himself with Kung Lao
       and leads the rebellion against Shao Kahn and his Outworld minions.
       However, he also has an ulterior motive: he seeks to free Kitana's
       home realm of Edenia.
     * With the latest advancements in human technologies, the Lin Kuei
       decide to automate their human assassins into soulless machines.
       Four ninjas, Cyrax, Sektor, Smoke, and Sub-Zero, are selected to
       serve as the first automation prototypes, but Sub-Zero and Smoke
       refuse to participate, forcing them to leave the clan.
       Unfortunately, Smoke is captured and is automated along with Sektor
       and Cyrax and all three are programmed to hunt down and kill
       Sub-Zero. Meanwhile, learning of the looming Outworld threat,
       Sub-Zero joins the rebellion against Shao Kahn.
     * Jax discovers the location of both Sonya and Kano while in
       Outworld, and in freeing Sonya, he also frees Kano. Knowing that
       his near future means arrest, Kano uses this opportunity to escape
       into the depths of Outworld and ultimately joins Shao Kahn's
       forces. Sonya and Jax return to Earth and try to warn their
       government about the looming Outworld threat, but when their pleas
       are ignored, Sonya and Jax instead prepare themselves for the
       upcoming war by joining the rebellion.
     * Despite both serving Shao Kahn, the Centaurs and Shokan have been
       at war with each other for years. Suspicions arise when Sheeva, who
       is appointed Sindel's bodyguard, learns that Motaro is appointed as
       Kahn's General in his armies. With the apparent, yet unconfirmed,
       "deaths" of both Kintaro and Goro, Sheeva begins to fear for her
       own race and makes plans to turn against Kahn should her suspicions
       prove to be true.
     * Largely dependent on a respirator and an undying thirst for revenge
       against the Black Dragon clan (who he believes was responsible for
       his brutal attack), Kabal joins the rebellion upon learning of
       Kano's survival.
     * Though he realizes that he is the lone survivor of New York City
       following the Outworld Invasion, Stryker remains ignorant as to why
       he survived the attack. However, upon receiving a vision from
       Raiden and being informed of what has transpired, Stryker decides
       to find and join the other Earthrealm warriors.
     * For many years, Nightwolf received visions that foretold and warned
       him of the upcoming invasion. Largely ignoring them, he feels
       guilty for not preventing it, and so joins the human offensive
       against Kahn by casting a magical protection over his ancestors'
       traditional homeland in North America. This region becomes a threat
       to Kahn's occupation of Earth.
     * Johnny Cage was hunted down by one of Shao Kahn's extermination
       squads and killed, apparently by Motaro.
