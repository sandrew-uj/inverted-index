   In Earth 2150 the three factions of the United Civilised States (UCS),
   the Eurasian Dynasty (ED) and the Lunar Corporation (LC) raced to build
   starships and evacuate the Earth before it became uninhabitable. All
   three factions succeeded and sent ships to Mars, but the UCS colony
   ship inexplicably disappeared en route. Both the ED and LC set about
   the difficult and lengthy task of terraforming Mars independently of
   one another, and also set up outposts on the outer planets and moons.

   In Earth 2160 the player initially takes the perspective of Major
   Michael Falkner of the ED forces. Falkner completes various missions
   for his ED superiors, largely against the LC, until he is sent to
   investigate a biological research operation that has gone silent. Upon
   reaching it an insectoid alien race is found, which then becomes the
   primary antagonist. At the end of the ED campaign, Falkner is betrayed
   by his superiors, who fear his idealism and imprison him.

   The game then shifts to the perspective of Commander Heldin Ariah, an
   LC commander who has gone rogue, and the player begins commanding LC
   units. The aliens are revealed to be the "Morphidians", and that the
   scientist who was studying them, Van Troff, has biologically altered
   himself to become their leader in an attempt to conquer the solar
   system. Ariah frees Falkner from imprisonment, and they discover the
   lost UCS colony ship the Phoenix and ally with its artificial
   intelligence.

   The player then switches to controlling UCS units. The player discovers
   an interstellar gateway and explores another solar system with a
   habitable planet, "Eden". They discover the origin of the Morphidians -
   they were constructed by a race called "The Builders" as a bioweapon.
   After some time opposing the aliens, they ambush Falkner, capturing and
   subverting him.

   The player then switches to the perspective of Falkner, biologically
   altered by Van Troff to serve him, commanding Morphidian units against
   his former allies. After several successes, Falkner is commanded to
   kill unarmed civilians, and he refuses, breaking Van Troff's control.
   Falkner turns his Morphidian units against Van Troff, and with the
   assistance of Ariah and the Phoenix's AI kills him and ends the threat
   to humanity.
