   Shade's poem digressively describes many aspects of his life. Canto 1
   includes his early encounters with death and glimpses of what he takes
   to be the supernatural. Canto 2 is about his family and the apparent
   suicide of his daughter, Hazel Shade. Canto 3 focuses on Shade's search
   for knowledge about an afterlife, culminating in a "faint hope" in
   higher powers "playing a game of worlds" as indicated by apparent
   coincidences. Canto 4 offers details on Shade's daily life and creative
   process, as well as thoughts on his poetry, which he finds to be a
   means of somehow understanding the universe.

   In Kinbote's editorial contributions he tells three stories intermixed
   with each other. One is his own story, notably including what he thinks
   of as his friendship with Shade. After Shade was murdered, Kinbote
   acquired the manuscript, including some variants, and has taken it upon
   himself to oversee the poem's publication, telling readers that it
   lacks only line 1000. Kinbote's second story deals with King Charles
   II, "The Beloved", the deposed king of Zembla. King Charles escaped
   imprisonment by Soviet-backed revolutionaries, making use of a secret
   passage and brave adherents in disguise. Kinbote repeatedly claims that
   he inspired Shade to write the poem by recounting King Charles's escape
   to him and that possible allusions to the king, and to Zembla, appear
   in Shade's poem, especially in rejected drafts. However, no explicit
   reference to King Charles is to be found in the poem. Kinbote's third
   story is that of Gradus, an assassin dispatched by the new rulers of
   Zembla to kill the exiled King Charles. Gradus makes his way from
   Zembla through Europe and America to New Wye, suffering comic mishaps.
   In the last note, to the missing line 1000, Kinbote narrates how Gradus
   killed Shade by mistake.

   Towards the end of the narrative, Kinbote all but states that he is in
   fact the exiled King Charles, living incognito; however, enough details
   throughout the story, as well as direct statements of ambiguous
   sincerity by Kinbote towards the novel's end, suggest that King Charles
   and Zembla are both fictitious. In the latter interpretation, Kinbote
   is delusional and has built an elaborate picture of Zembla complete
   with samples of a constructed language as a by-product of insanity;
   similarly, Gradus was simply an unhinged man trying to kill Shade, and
   his backstory as a revolutionary assassin is also made up.

   In an interview, Nabokov later claimed that Kinbote committed suicide
   after finishing the book. The critic Michael Wood has stated,
   "This is authorial trespassing, and we don't have to pay attention to
   it", but Brian Boyd has argued that internal evidence points to
   Kinbote's suicide. One of Kinbote's annotations to Shade's poem
   (corresponding to line 493) addresses the subject of suicide at some
   length.
