   In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United
   States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as
   the Infected. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees
   the chaos with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah
   (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in
   Joel's arms.

   Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection.
   Survivors live in totalitarian quarantine zones, independent
   settlements, and nomadic groups, leaving buildings and houses deserted.
   Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess (Annie Wersching) in the
   quarantine zone in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt
   down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a
   stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he
   traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the
   quarantine zone authorities.

   The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), promises to
   double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie
   (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House
   outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the
   night, but after an encounter with a government patrol, they discover
   Ellie is infected. Symptoms normally occur within two days, but Ellie
   claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may
   lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through
   hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been
   killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing
   in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so
   Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former
   Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies.

   With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler and survivalist who
   owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle from Bill's
   neighborhood. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are
   ambushed by bandits, and their car is wrecked. They ally with two
   brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter). After they
   escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his
   infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and
   commits suicide. In the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in
   Jackson, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a
   hydroelectric dam with his wife Maria (Ashley Scott). Joel decides to
   leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he
   lets her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at
   the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned,
   but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake
   City, Utah. The two are attacked by bandits, and Joel is severely
   wounded while escaping.

   During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on
   the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for
   food, Ellie encounters David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben Langdon),
   scavengers willing to trade medicine for food. David turns hostile
   after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie
   manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is captured; David
   intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing, she escapes
   after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant.
   Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He
   reaches her just as she kills David with a machete, an act that
   traumatizes her, and Joel comforts her before they flee.

   In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is
   rendered unconscious after almost drowning before they are captured by
   a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is
   being prepared for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the
   infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's
   brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles
   his way to the operating room, kills the lead surgeon, and carries the
   unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene,
   whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them.
   On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel claims that the
   Fireflies had found many other immune people, but were unable to create
   a cure and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's
   settlement, Ellie expresses her survivor guilt. At her insistence, Joel
   swears his story about the Fireflies is true.
