   The story is set in Padua, Italy, in a distant and unspecified past.
   From his quarters, Giovanni Guasconti, a young student of letters at
   the University of Padua, looks at Beatrice, the beautiful daughter of
   Dr. Giacomo Rappaccini, a scientist who works in isolation. Beatrice is
   confined to the lush and locked gardens, which are filled with
   poisonous plants grown by her father. Giovanni notices Beatrice's
   strangely intimate relationship with the plants as well as the
   withering of fresh flowers and the death of an insect when exposed to
   her skin or breath. Having fallen in love, Giovanni enters the garden
   and meets with Beatrice a number of times, while ignoring his mentor,
   Professor Pietro Baglioni, who warns him that Rappaccini is devious and
   that he and his work should be avoided. Giovanni discovers that
   Beatrice, having been raised in the presence of poison, is poisonous
   herself. Beatrice urges Giovanni to look past her poisonous exterior
   and see her pure and innocent essence, creating great feelings of doubt
   in Giovanni. He begins to suffer the consequences of his encounters
   with the plants--and with Beatrice--when he discovers that he himself
   has become poisonous; after another meeting with Baglioni, Giovanni
   brings a powerful antidote to Beatrice so that they can be together,
   but the antidote kills Beatrice rather than cure her of her poisonous
   nature.
