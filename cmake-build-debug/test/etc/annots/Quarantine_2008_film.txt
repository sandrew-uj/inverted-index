   On the evening of March 11, 2008, news reporter Angela Vidal and her
   cameraman Scott Percival are filming their report on the night shift in
   the Los Angeles Fire Department. Two firefighters Jake and Fletcher
   receive an emergency call at the local apartment building. Screams from
   the apartment of elderly resident Mrs. Espinosa were heard by the
   landlord Yuri, his wife Wanda, and other residents: veterinarian
   Lawrence, opera teacher Bernard, his roommate Sadie, lawyer Randy,
   mother Kathy, her daughter Briana, and immigrant couple Nadif and
   Jwahir. The crew enter with police officers Danny and James. They are
   attacked by an aggressive Espinosa who bites James and Fletcher. Danny
   shoots her down. The team finds another resident Elise in a similar
   condition and bring her downstairs with the others. Those wounded by
   Espinosa become sick and delirious.

   The authorities and CDC quarantine the building, not allowing anyone to
   leave. Angela interviews Briana, who states that her dog is at the vet
   because he was sick. Lawrence recognizes the symptoms as similar to
   those of rabies. Angela and Scott witness a rabid dog maul Randy to
   death. They are attacked by Elise and Scott kills her in self-defense.
   CDC officers wearing hazmat suits enter the building to test Fletcher
   and James who have become naturally aggressive and bites one of the
   officers and Lawrence. The surviving inspector reveals that Briana's
   dog is the reason the CDC has quarantined the building, as it was
   infected. Briana succumbs and bites her mother before fleeing. The
   group finds Briana, who is now infected. She bites Danny, which forces
   the others to rush back downstairs as all the infected break loose.
   Kathy is killed and Nadif and Jwahir are infected by Lawrence.

   The remaining group locks themselves in a room upstairs but discover
   both the inspector and Sadie have been bitten. Bernard attempts to
   escape the building but is killed by a sniper outside. Yuri deduces
   that the basement, which connects to the sewers, may be the only way
   out. Yuri is attacked and bitten by the health inspector - who has just
   succumbed to the infection. Wanda refuses to leave her husband behind
   and gets bitten by Sadie. Jake, Angela, and Scott flee.

   The trio manage to find to the basement key whilst overcoming most of
   the infected along the way. Jake is bitten by the infected Yuri,
   leaving Angela and Scott as the sole survivors. The pair are forced
   upstairs to the attic apartment by the infected, where they find lab
   equipment and newspaper clippings about a doomsday cult and a break-in
   at a military's biological facility for a chemical weapons lab where
   "Armageddon Virus", a deadly mutated strain of rabies, was stolen. A
   trapdoor opens from the attic and Scott loses the camera light when an
   infected boy swats at it. Scott turns on the night vision before he and
   Angela hear banging noises inside the apartment. The source of the
   noises is an emaciated person, apparently unaware of them, blindly
   searching.

   They attempt to escape but Scott drops the camera as the figure attacks
   him. Angela retrieves it and sees the infected man eating Scott before
   she is also attacked. She drops the camera and is dragged into the
   darkness, screaming.
