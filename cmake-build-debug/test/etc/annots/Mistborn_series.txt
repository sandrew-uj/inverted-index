   Mistborn is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author
   Brandon Sanderson and published by Tor Books. The first trilogy,
   published between 2006 and 2008, consists of The Final Empire, The Well
   of Ascension, and The Hero of Ages.

   To prepare readers for the second series, Sanderson wrote a
   transitional sequel, The Alloy of Law, which then became the first
   installment in the Wax and Wayne tetralogy, set 300 years
   later.^[1]^[2] This was followed by Shadows of Self, released on
   October 6, 2015; The Bands of Mourning, published on January 26, 2016;
   and The Lost Metal, to be written in the next few years. Sanderson also
   published a novella tied to the original trilogy, titled Mistborn:
   Secret History, on January 26, 2016. A third trilogy is being planned,
   set to take place "in the early days of computer programming"^[3] and
   with novels set to release in 2025, 2026, and 2027 respectively.^[4]
