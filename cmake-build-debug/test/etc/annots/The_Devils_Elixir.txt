   The Devil's Elixirs is predominantly a first-person narrative related
   by the Capuchin monk Medardus. He is ignorant of his family history and
   what he knows about his childhood is based upon fragments of memory and
   a few events his mother has explained to him.

   Medardus cannot resist the devil's elixir, which has been entrusted to
   him and which awakens in him sensual desires. After being sent from his
   cloister to Rome, he finds a Count, disguised as a monk as a means of
   seeing his lover, and pushes him (whether intentionally or not is
   ambiguous) from a "Teufelssitz" ("devil's perch"). Unbeknownst to all
   involved, the Count is Medardus's half-brother and the Count's lover is
   his half-sister. The Count becomes his lunatic doppelgaenger and
   crosses his path multiple times after Medardus abandons his
   ecclesiastical position, drifting throughout the world.

   The story centers on his love for a young princess, Aurelie. After
   murdering her stepmother (the above-mentioned half-sister) and brother,
   Medardus flees to a city. After his devilish connection is found out by
   an old painter, Medardus flees the city with the help of a "foolish"
   hair dresser with two personalities, who serves as a foil to the
   destructive dual identity of Medardus, gaily living as both Peter
   Schoenfeld and Pietro Belcampo. He arrives at a prince's court, soon
   followed by Aurelie. She recognizes the monk as her brother's murderer
   and Medardus is thrown in jail. He is released only after the
   doppelgaenger appears and is taken as the murderer.

   Having passed himself off for a Polish noble while in prison he is
   engaged to Aurelie. On their wedding day however, he is overcome by a
   fit of madness, hearing the voice of the doppelgaenger, which has been
   occurring ever more frequently to this point; he stabs Aurelie, frees
   the doppelgaenger as he was being taken to his execution, and runs
   about the wilderness fighting the doppelgaenger for months until he
   awakens in an Italian cloister, once more saved by Pietro/Peter. He is
   once more wearing his frock with the name Medardus stitched on it.

   Returned to his original identity Medardus undergoes an intense process
   of repentance and discovers his family history by reading the diary of
   a painter. After meeting with the Pope and becoming involved in
   potentially fatal Vatican political intrigue (which suggest he may
   still have devilish ambitions to power) Medardus returns to the German
   cloister. A great fest is being held - Aurelie is soon to take her
   final vows to become a nun. Once again he must struggle with his lust.
   Just as he seems to have mastered it the doppelgaenger rushes in and
   stabs Aurelie, fatally this time, and once more escapes. At the end, he
   writes this manuscript as an act of penance. A final note from the
   librarian of the cloister reveals circumstances of his death - namely a
   hysterical laughing which casts doubt on his implied redemption from
   satanic possession. (or - since he dies in a calm sleep precisely a
   year after Aurelie, he did repent; and the laughter was given out by
   his half-brother, still lurking in the cloister's hidden chambers,
   still embodying the evil part of the protagonist's personality, and
   still needing time to repent, which he could do after joining the
   cloister as a monk with Leonardus' help).
