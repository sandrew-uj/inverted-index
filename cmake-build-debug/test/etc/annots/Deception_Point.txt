   On the eve of a U.S. presidential election, NASA discovers concrete
   proof of extraterrestrial life within a meteorite in the Milne Ice
   Shelf. The discovery gains overwhelming political importance because
   NASA's gross expenditure and low yield is the hottest topic of debate.
   To verify the authenticity of the evidence, the president sends a team
   of five carefully chosen individuals: four scientists - Michael
   Tolland, Corky Marlinson, Norah Mangor and Wailee Ming - and a National
   Reconnaissance Office (NRO) employee, Rachel Sexton, daughter of
   Senator Sexton the presidential candidate.

   The authenticity of the discovery seems beyond doubt. But when the team
   discovers a seemingly insignificant anomaly, a Delta Force team that
   was secretly monitoring them attacks, kills Ming and Mangor while
   leaving Rachel, Tolland and Marlinson to perish on an ice floe. The
   three, however, are picked up by the Navy submarine USS Charlotte and
   manage to inform the president's adviser, Marjorie Tench and the NRO
   director, William Pickering about the incident. Tench hushes up their
   report while Pickering takes it seriously and sends them an air
   transport.

   Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Tench tries to hurt Sexton's campaign
   through his aide, Gabrielle Ashe. She attempts to blackmail Gabrielle
   with photos of her extramarital affair with Senator Sexton and reveals
   that the senator's sponsors are private aerospace corporations who
   would reap profit from taking NASA's place. A distraught Ashe
   investigates the claims and discovers that they are true but also finds
   out that NASA had lied about the origin of their discovery.

   The surviving researchers retreat to Tolland's research ship off the
   New Jersey coast where they fully re-analyze their data and discover
   that the meteorite is fake. A surprise attack by the Delta Force team
   however, prompts Rachel to fax the result of the analysis to her
   father, asking for help. In the ensuing skirmish, all Delta Force
   soldiers are killed, their helicopter is sunk and Pickering is revealed
   to be their commander. He tells Rachel about her father's true
   motivations for becoming President, and that Pickering masterminded the
   fake meteorite to hurt Senator Sexton's campaign. The ship and
   Pickering are sucked in by a vortex, while a Coast Guard Osprey picks
   up Rachel, Tolland and Marlinson.

   Senator Sexton attempts to publicize Rachel's fax, incriminating the
   president and NASA. However, during his press conference, Rachel and
   Gabrielle swap the envelopes containing copies of Rachel's fax with
   those containing evidences of his extramarital affairs, humiliating him
   and ruining his chances for the presidency. By the end of the story,
   Michael and Rachel have developed a romantic relationship.
