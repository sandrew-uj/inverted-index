   The series details the weeks leading up to the Apocalypse. It features
   a chaotic and increasingly unstable global political situation in which
   nuclear alerts are accidentally triggered by malfunctioning Space
   Invaders machines. The naive and highly unpopular Republican U.S.
   President Johnny Cyclops (an obvious Ronald Reagan parody, played by
   Barry Morse) is advised by an insane right-wing fundamentalist security
   advisor, called The Deacon, who claims to have a direct hotline to God.
   (The Deacon was so named because of the previous role of the actor who
   played him (John Barron) as a Cathedral Dean in the sitcom All Gas and
   Gaiters; the writers claimed not to know at the time that Alexander
   Haig, Reagan's first Secretary of State, was known as The Vicar in the
   White House.)

   In the Eastern Hemisphere, things are similarly unstable. Soviet
   Premier Dubienkin (Richard Griffiths) is in fact a series of clones,
   which keep dying and being replaced. Meanwhile, the deposed Shah of
   Iran, Shah Massiq Rassim (Bruce Montague), led by his advisor Abdab
   (David Kelly) who is always blindfolded to avoid looking upon the
   Shah's magnificence, is shunted around the world in search of a refuge
   (spending most of the series in a cross channel ferry's toilet).

   The main danger is the Deacon's development of a new super-powerful
   American nuclear weapon. This is originally called the Johnny Cyclops
   Bomb; later, when the President vetoes the name, it is renamed the
   Quark Bomb (Formerly Known As The Johnny Cyclops Bomb After The
   President of the Same Name). The Deacon arranges for Lacrobat (John
   Cleese), a disguised international arms smuggler nicknamed The Devil (a
   parody of Carlos the Jackal), to steal a Quark Bomb and take it to
   Iran, to help the Shah in his counterrevolution. The Soviets get word
   of this (via Rassim's parrot) and decide to invade, gaining control
   over the world's oil supply.

   The Soviets have a new ally in British Prime Minister Kevin Pork (Peter
   Jones), a parody of left-wing Labour politicians Michael Foot and Peter
   Shore. Pork, who has gone insane and believes himself to be Superman,
   heads an especially left-wing government (a parody of Foot's Labour
   Party). The British Foreign Secretary is blackmailed by the Soviets to
   join the Warsaw Pact. This situation so unnerves the foreign secretary
   (Geoffrey Palmer, in a role based on David Owen) and the Chancellor of
   the Exchequer (Richard Davies) that they also lose their sanity, don
   Green Lantern and Hawkman costumes, and are locked up in a padded cell
   at 10 Downing St.

   The Soviets are also holding two elderly American tourists named
   Jonathan and Martha Hopper captive. They are constantly tortured by
   Commissar Alex Solzhenitsyn ("no relation", played by Alexei Sayle) in
   the belief they are secretly CIA spies. This turns out to be true, but
   the Hoppers are crushed by a helicopter in a bungled CIA rescue
   operation. This does not help Cyclops's nosediving popularity rating,
   which is just below that of Charles Manson. The Deacon stages an
   assassination attempt in order to help Cyclops' flagging popularity (a
   reference to the Reagan assassination attempt the year before). It is
   damaged further when the speeding ambulance carrying Cyclops to the
   hospital accidentally runs over his highly popular main opponent,
   Democratic Senator Jimmy Hennessy (a parody of Senator Teddy Kennedy).
   By the end of the series we're told Cyclops is now less popular than
   the Boston Strangler. (These developments are followed by a dramatic
   newsreader named Jay Garrick, and his topless female counterpart across
   the Atlantic.)

   Eventually the Quark Bomb is accidentally detonated in Israel when
   Lacrobat's attempt to prevent it being incinerated goes horribly wrong,
   destroying the country and killing most of the US army who were
   stationed there. Meanwhile, the Shah, who has temporarily been given
   sanctuary aboard a space shuttle, manages to crash it into the Moscow
   Kremlin. Believing it to be a bomb, the Russians launch their weapons
   at America. In the final scene Soviet missiles are on their way to
   obliterate the United States and President Cyclops has to decide
   whether to retaliate. The title sequence already showed the aftermath
   of the decision, Earth reduced to a nuclear wasteland. In a final
   twist, we discover that the woman we see in the title sequence selling
   buttons reading "WEAR YOUR MUSHROOM WITH PRIDE" is in fact the First
   Lady, who was hidden in a fallout shelter and is one of the few
   survivors of the war.
