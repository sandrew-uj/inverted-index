   Space is explored not by short-sighted governments, but by the Earth
   Company, a private corporation which becomes enormously wealthy and
   powerful as a result. Nine star systems are found to lack planets
   suitable for colonization, so space stations are built in orbit
   instead, stepping stones for further exploration. Then, Pell's World is
   found to be not only habitable, but already populated by the gentle,
   sentient (if technologically backward) Hisa. Pell Station is built. The
   planet is nicknamed "Downbelow" by the stationers, who also start to
   call their home "Downbelow Station".

   When Earth's out-of-touch policies cause it to begin losing control of
   its more distant stations and worlds, it builds a fleet of fifty
   military carriers, the Earth Company Fleet, to enforce its will. This
   leads to the prolonged Company War with the breakaway Union, based at
   Cyteen, another habitable world. Caught in between are the stationers
   and the merchanters^[3] who crew the freighters that maintain
   interstellar trade.

   Set in the final days of the war, Downbelow Station opens with Earth
   Company Captain Signy Mallory and her warship, Norway, escorting a
   ragtag fleet fleeing from Russell's and Mariner Stations to Pell.
   Similar convoys arrive from other stations destroyed or lost to Union,
   leading to an enormous crisis. The flood of unexpected refugees strains
   station resources. Angelo Konstantin, Stationmaster of Pell, and his
   two sons, Damon and Emilio, struggle to cope with the situation.
   Fearing Union infiltrators and saboteurs, Pell dumps all the refugees
   in a Quarantine Zone, causing massive dislocations of Pell's own
   citizens.

   While conferring with Pell's administrators, Mallory encounters a
   delegation from the Earth Company, led by Segust Ayres, Second
   Secretary of Earth's Security Council. Offended by her brusque,
   arrogant manner, Ayres declines her offer of transportation to the
   front and charters a freighter instead. Unbeknownst to Mallory, Ayres'
   mission is to open peace negotiations with Union.

   Mallory also drops off a Union prisoner of war, Josh Talley, whom she
   had rescued from a brutal interrogation by panicked security forces at
   Russell's. However, on the voyage to Pell, her sexual exploitation of
   him had been only marginally less abusive. Faced with indefinite
   confinement on Pell, Talley requests Adjustment, the wiping of much of
   his memory, in return for his freedom. When questioned by Damon
   Konstantin, he requests Adjustment to escape the indefinite
   imprisonment, so Konstantin reluctantly gives his permission. Upon
   later review of his file, Damon learns that Talley had already
   undergone the treatment once before at Russell's. Still feeling guilty
   for agreeing, he and his wife Elene Quen befriend the post-Adjustment
   Talley, an act of kindness that will have monumental, unforeseen
   consequences.

   Jon Lukas, Angelo Konstantin's brother-in-law and only rival for power,
   is worried about the course of the war. The Fleet has received little
   or no support from an indifferent Earth and is gradually losing a war
   of attrition. He secretly contacts Union, offering to hand Pell over.
   Union responds by smuggling in a secret agent named Jessad.

   Meanwhile, the last ten surviving Company Fleet ships under the command
   of Conrad Mazian gather for the most critical operation of the war. All
   of Mazian's recent strategic maneuvers and raids have been leading up
   to this point. If they can take out Viking Station in one coordinated
   strike before their enemy's growing numerical superiority can overwhelm
   them, there would be a wide, barren region between Earth and Union
   space, one which would make further conflict vastly more costly for
   Union.
   Downbelow Station (20th Anniversary Edition)

   Seb Azov, the Union military commander, has no choice but to gather his
   forces at Viking to await Mazian's anticipated attack. However, he has
   an ace up his sleeve. He has pressured Ayres into recording a message
   ordering Mazian to break off while peace is being negotiated. When
   Mazian strikes, Ayres' broadcast order does indeed force him to abort
   and the Fleet retreats to Pell in confusion.

   Mazian meets with his captains and gives them the choice of accepting a
   peace treaty that essentially concedes victory to Union as per Ayres'
   broadcast or rebelling against Earth and continuing to fight that is
   his preference. They all remain loyal to their leader. One of Mazian's
   first acts is to place Pell under martial law.

   The Fleet is now forced to defend Downbelow Station, its only reliable
   base and supply source. Union forces attack and destroy two ships out
   on patrol. While Union suffers casualties as well, it can replace its
   losses, unlike Mazian. Counting one carrier lost earlier in the debacle
   at Viking, he has just seven ships left.

   Under cover of the panic on the station caused by the battle in space,
   Lukas makes his move, killing and supplanting his hated rival, Angelo
   Konstantin. To escape rioting refugees, Elene Quen is forced to board
   Finity's End, one of the most respected merchanter ships. The
   freighters flee the battle zone, but Quen convinces most of them to
   band together, for safety and to maximize their leverage whatever
   happens. Damon survives his uncle's assassination attempt and links up
   with Talley. Together, they manage to hide from Lukas; in fact, Talley
   discovers he is surprisingly good at it.

   Eventually, they are contacted by Jessad, and Talley finds out why. He
   and Jessad are the same kind: azi, artificially bred and, in Jessad and
   Talley's case, trained especially for espionage and sabotage. They are
   discovered by Fleet marines; Jessad is killed, while Konstantin and
   Talley are captured and taken to Mallory.

   She receives orders from Mazian to quietly dispose of Konstantin. Lukas
   does the Fleet's bidding with far fewer scruples, so Konstantin is
   superfluous, even dangerous. Mazian is preparing to disable and abandon
   Downbelow Station. He has another goal in mind: to take over Earth
   itself in a surprise coup d'etat. The wrecking of Pell would create a
   firebreak with Union, playing the role he had originally intended for
   Viking.

   Mallory has different ideas. Mazian has gone too far for her to
   stomach. She abruptly undocks from Pell and deserts. Mallory finds the
   Union forces and persuades Azov to unleash them against her former
   comrades. Talley is instrumental in convincing Azov of Mallory's
   truthfulness.

   Mazian cannot afford a costly fight, so the Fleet sets off for Earth
   prematurely. Azov needs to pursue him, but is unwilling to leave Norway
   intact behind him. The tense standoff is broken by a timely arrival;
   Quen returns with the united merchanter fleet and claims Pell for the
   newborn Merchanter's Alliance, with Norway as its militia. Without the
   authority to deal with this new development and unwilling to fight the
   merchanters, Azov leaves to deal with Mazian.

   The end of the Company War is at last in sight, much to the relief of
   the Konstantins, the merchanters, and the residents of Downbelow
   Station.
