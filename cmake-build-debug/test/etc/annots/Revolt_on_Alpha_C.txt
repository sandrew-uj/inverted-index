   The story takes place in the year 2363. The protagonist is Cadet Larry
   Stark, a 20-year-old, fresh graduate of the Space Patrol Academy who
   comes from a long line of Space Patrol commanders. As the story begins,
   he is embarking on the customary final training cruise on the
   interstellar ship Carden. At the end of this cruise, he will be awarded
   a commission as officer of the Space Patrol. The ship makes the four
   and a half light-year journey to the star Alpha Centauri in a span of
   15 days using the faster-than-light overdrive. The fourth planet
   orbiting Alpha C, an earth-like planet inhabited by dinosaurs, has been
   colonized 125 years earlier.

   Cadet Stark, who has been taught to obey orders and to trust the
   infallibility of Earth and the Space Patrol, arrives at planet IV of
   Alpha C just as the colonists are voting to declare, and possibly fight
   for, their independence from Earth. The arrival of the Carden and its
   crew can potentially affect the course of events in this revolution.
   The young cadet, for the first time in his life, must choose the proper
   and honorable course of action in a situation where there is no clear
   right and wrong. The consequences of his actions may place in jeopardy
   his career with the Space Patrol and the love of his father.
