   The story takes place on the planet Mars in an alternate universe solar
   system in which probes from both the United States and the Soviet Union
   find intelligent life and civilizations on both Venus and Mars. The
   book is heavily influenced by the works of writers such as Edgar Rice
   Burroughs, Ray Bradbury, and Leigh Brackett.

   It is a sequel to The Sky People, which is set on Venus. Stirling later
   wrote a short story prequel, "Sword of Zar-Tu-Kan", which was published
   in the 2013 anthology Old Mars, edited by George R. R. Martin and
   Gardner Dozois.
