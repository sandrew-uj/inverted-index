   In a near-future, a British neuroscientist named Professor Burgess
   Phelan has discovered a portion of the brain, the VMN, that is
   typically twice the size in men as it is in women. In certain men,
   however (approximately 1 in 100,000), it is the same size as a woman's,
   and that abnormality is an exceptionally accurate indicator of violent
   sociopathy. Professor Phelan developed an imaging device called
   L.O.M.B.R.O.S.O. (Localisation of Modullar Brain Resonations Obliging
   Social Orthopraxy) used to help diagnose men with the VMN deficiency.

   In the interests of public safety, the Lombroso institute is set up to
   test all the men in Britain. Males are enticed with ad campaigns to
   submit for testing; those who are VMN-negative are given confidential
   treatment, including counselling and drugs, and assigned a code name
   out of the Penguin book of Great Thinkers (e.g., Shakespeare, Plato,
   etc.). The police aren't given the names of the VMN-negative, but they
   are allowed to confirm whether or not a particular person is in the
   Lombroso Institutes system as VMN-negative.

   "Wittgenstein" is the code name of a VMN-negative who, until he was
   made aware of his status, was living a well-adjusted, if solitary,
   life, venting his sociopathic tendencies harmlessly through virtual
   reality entertainment systems. Upon discovering his pathology, though,
   he undertakes a public service of his own: after hacking into the
   Lombroso Institute's systems and obtaining a list of all VMN-negative
   men in Britain, he undertakes to kill them all.

   The narrative unfolds from a dual perspective: Wittgenstein's, and the
   female police lieutenant, Isadora "Jake" Jakowicz, assigned to catch
   him. Wittgenstein's portion is told from the first person as a diary of
   his assassinations and subsequent downfall; the detective's portion is
   told in a more traditional third-person perspective.
