   A team from an Air Force base is deployed to recover a military
   satellite that has returned to Earth, but contact is lost abruptly.
   Aerial surveillance reveals that everyone in Piedmont, Arizona, the
   town closest to where the satellite landed, is apparently dead. The
   duty officer of the base tasked with retrieving the satellite suspects
   it returned with an extraterrestrial contaminant and recommends
   activating "Wildfire", a protocol for a government-sponsored team of
   scientists intended to contain threats of this nature.

   The Wildfire team, led by Dr. Jeremy Stone, believes the
   satellite--intentionally designed to capture upper-atmosphere
   microorganisms for bio-weapon exploitation--returned with a deadly
   microorganism that kills through nearly instantaneous blood clotting.
   Upon investigating Piedmont, the team discovers the townspeople either
   died in mid-stride or went "quietly nuts" and committed bizarre
   suicides. Two survivors--the sick, Sterno-addicted, geriatric Peter
   Jackson and the constantly bawling infant Jamie Ritter--are biological
   opposites who somehow survived the organism.

   Jackson, Ritter, and the satellite are taken to the secret underground
   Wildfire laboratory, a secure facility equipped with every known
   capacity for protection against microorganisms escaping into the
   environment. Wildfire is hidden in a remote area near Flatrock, Nevada,
   sixty miles from Las Vegas, concealed in the sub-basements of a
   legitimate Department of Agriculture research station. Dr. Hall is the
   only scientist authorized to disarm the automatic self-destruct
   mechanism; he is an unmarried male and thus presumed to make the most
   dispassionate decisions during crisis.

   Further investigation determines the deaths were caused by an
   extraterrestrial microbe transported by a meteor that crashed into the
   satellite, knocking it from orbit. The microbe contains chemical
   elements required for terrestrial life and appears to have a
   crystalline structure, but lacks the DNA, RNA, proteins, and amino
   acids present in all forms of terrestrial life, and directly transforms
   energy to matter with no discernible byproducts. The microbe, code
   named "Andromeda", mutates with each growth cycle, changing its
   biological properties.

   The scientists learn that the current form of Andromeda grows only in a
   narrow pH range; in a too-acidic or too-alkaline growth medium, it will
   not multiply. Andromeda's ideal pH range is 7.39-7.43, within the range
   found in normal human blood. Jackson and Ritter survived because both
   had abnormal blood pH (Jackson acidotic from consumption of Sterno and
   aspirin, Ritter alkalotic from hyperventilation). However, by the time
   the scientists realize this, Andromeda has mutated into a form that
   degrades the lab's plastic seals and escapes containment. Trapped in a
   contaminated lab, Dr. Charles Burton demands that Stone inject him with
   a "universal antibiotic"; Stone refuses, arguing it would render Burton
   too vulnerable to infection by other harmful bacteria. Burton survives
   because the mutated Andromeda is no longer pathogenic.

   The mutated Andromeda attacks the synthetic rubber door and hatch seals
   within the Wildfire facility, rapidly migrating toward the upper levels
   and the surface. The self-destruct nuclear weapon is automatically
   armed when it detects the containment breach, triggering its detonation
   countdown to prevent the spread of the infection. As the bomb arms, the
   scientists realize that given Andromeda's ability to generate matter
   directly from energy, the organism would be able to consume the
   released energy and ultimately benefit from a nuclear explosion,
   forming a large indestructible biofilm within a day.

   To halt the detonation, Hall must insert a special key he carries into
   an emergency substation, one of which should be accessible from any
   location in Wildfire. Unfortunately, he is trapped in a section that,
   due to an oversight, has no substation. He must navigate Wildfire's
   obstacle course of automatic defenses to reach a working substation on
   an upper level. He barely disarms the bomb before all the air is
   evacuated from the deepest level of the Wildfire complex, which
   contains the remainder of the team and their assistants. Andromeda is
   suspected to have eventually mutated into a benign form and migrated to
   the upper atmosphere, where the oxygen content is lower, better suiting
   its growth.

   The novel's epilogue reveals that a crewed spacecraft, Andros V, was
   incinerated during atmospheric re-entry, presumably because Andromeda
   had eaten its tungsten/plastic laminate heat shield and caused it to
   burn up.
