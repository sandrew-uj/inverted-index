   Set at an undetermined point in the near future, the American Southwest
   has been ravaged by drought, brought on by rising heat and extreme
   water shortages due to the debilitating effects of climate change. The
   Colorado River and its tributaries, which are an essential source of
   water for the region, has decreased to a mere trickle. In Nevada,
   Arizona, and California, corrupt business magnates control the severely
   depleted water supply, and routinely battle in armed conflicts for
   dwindling portions of the river.

   Angel Velasquez, a detective, assassin and spy "cuts" water for the
   Southern Nevada Water Authority, controlled by his boss Catherine Case.
   Angel's job, as a "water knife", is to infiltrate and sabotage the
   water supplies of competing states, and to make sure that Case can keep
   her luxuriant arcology developments thriving in Las Vegas. Case wants
   to ensure that the rich stay wet, while the poor get nothing but dust.

   When reports of a game-changing water source arise in Phoenix, Angel is
   sent south to investigate in his customized Tesla. Upon arriving in the
   blistering heat of Arizona, he encounters Lucy Monroe, an award winning
   journalist harboring her own agenda and secrets, and Maria Villarosa, a
   young refugee from Texas, surviving on her instincts and shrewdness.
   The three find themselves being manipulated in a corrupt game, larger
   and dirtier than any of them could have ever imagined.

   Angel soon discovers that California is trying to monopolize the tiny
   current of the river, and with Phoenix on the verge of collapsing into
   chaos and violence, the bodies begin to stack up. As time starts to run
   out for the three, they discover their only hope for survival rests in
   one another's hands. But when water is such a precious commodity in the
   desert region, and where partnerships can change in the blink of an
   eye, the only thing for certain is that someone will have to bleed if
   anyone hopes to drink.
