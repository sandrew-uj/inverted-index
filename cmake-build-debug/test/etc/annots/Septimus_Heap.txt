   Septimus Heap is a series of fantasy novels featuring a protagonist of
   the same name written by English author Angie Sage. In all, it features
   seven novels, entitled Magyk, Flyte, Physik, Queste, Syren, Darke, and
   Fyre. The first, (Magyk), in 2005 and the final, (Fyre), in 2013.^[1] A
   full colour supplement to the series, entitled The Magykal Papers, was
   published in June 2009, and an online novella titled The Darke Toad is
   also available. A sequel trilogy, The TodHunter Moon Series, set seven
   years after the events of Fyre, began in October 2014.^[2]

   The series follows the adventures of Septimus Heap who, as a seventh
   son of a seventh son, has extraordinary magical powers. After he
   becomes an apprentice to the ("ExtraOrdinary") wizard of the series,
   Marcia Overstrand, he must study for seven years and a day until his
   apprenticeship ends. In the first book, he is known as Young Army
   Expendable Boy 412, until his great-aunt, Zelda Zanuba Heap reveals his
   true identity. His adventures are placed in the context of the warmth
   and strength of his family, and developed alongside those of Jenna, his
   adoptive sister, who is heir to the throne of the Castle, the community
   where they live. The novels, set in an elaborate fantastic world,
   describe the many challenges that Septimus and his friends must
   overcome.

   The books have appeared on national bestsellers lists and received
   worldwide critical acclaim; Warner Bros. acquired the rights to produce
   a movie based on the first book.^[3] The series has been noted for the
   realism and richness of its characters, the compelling nature of their
   adventures, and its humour. It has been compared with Harry Potter and
   other works within the genre.
