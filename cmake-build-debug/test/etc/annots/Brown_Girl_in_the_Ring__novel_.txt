   The setting of Brown Girl in The Ring is post-apocalyptic in nature.
   The story takes place in the city core of Metropolitan Toronto
   (Downtown Toronto) after the economic collapse. Riots of the past have
   caused the inner city of Toronto to collapse into a slum of poverty,
   homelessness, and violence. While the elite and city officials have
   fled to the suburbs, children are left to fend for themselves and
   survive on the streets which are ruled by Rudy Sheldon and his posse of
   criminal thugs. As a consequence of the Riots, Toronto is isolated from
   other satellite cities in the surrounding Greater Toronto Area (North
   York, Scarborough, Etobicoke) by roadblocks and Lake Ontario has become
   a mudhole. Disappearances and murder are not uncommon, and everyone is
   left to either fend for themselves or bind together to provide support
   for each other.

   In the twelve years since the Riots, the city is now ruled by a
   criminal mastermind, Rudy Sheldon. Rudy is commissioned to find a heart
   for the Premier of Ontario, who needs a heart transplant. Normally, the
   Porcine Organ Harvest Program is used, but the adviser of Premier
   Catherine Uttley encourages her to deem the program "immoral" and make
   a public statement of preference for a human donor instead.

   Hopkinson then introduces the heroine of the story, and a very
   different perspective of life in the outskirt of the city is seen.
   Ti-Jeanne, the granddaughter of Gros-Jeanne, is struggling with
   different problems than street survival. Having recently given birth to
   a baby boy, Ti-Jeanne is forced to move back in with her grandmother to
   care for her child as a single mother; the child's father, Tony,
   suffers from addiction and is a member of the posse. While she loves
   her Mami, she has difficulty seeing the importance of her grandmother's
   spiritualism and medicinal work, and is frightened by her visions of
   death. Gros-Jeanne has gone to great lengths in the past to share her
   culture with her family, but has continuously been pushed away by her
   daughter and granddaughter. In the community, she is a well-respected
   apothecary and spiritualist who runs an herbal and medicine shop.

   Paths begin to cross when Tony is called upon by Rudy. Hopes of leaving
   his criminal life behind and reconnecting with his love, Ti-Jeanne, are
   shattered when the threats from the posse leader begin to loom over
   him. Tony must perform a horrific murder in order to obtain a heart
   that will save the life of one of the city's elite. The situation only
   gets worse when he involves his relationship with Ti- and Gros-Jeanne
   with his business with the posse. He arrives on Gros-Jeanne's doorstep
   asking for protection, and Ti-Jeanne convinces her to help him flee the
   city without harm.

   The magic comes alive for the rest of the novel when Tony seeks help
   from the spiritualism of Gros-Jeanne. In attempts to save Tony,
   Ti-Jeanne performs the rituals alongside her Mami and accepts her
   father spirit. When plans go awry, Tony makes a rash decision that
   forces Ti-Jeanne to be the one to save herself and the city from Rudy's
   evil spiritual acts.

   Later in the novel, Rudy is revealed to be Ti-Jeanne's grandfather,
   Gros-Jeanne's husband. It turns out that Rudy was an abusive husband
   and Gros-Jeanne kicked him out and found a new lover, named Dunston,
   and since Rudy has been vengeful.

   Meanwhile, Rudy summons the Calabash Duppy spirit and commands the
   duppy to kill Gros-Jeanne, Ti-Jeanne and Tony, who was sent to kill
   Gros-Jeanne and take her heart for Premier Uttley. It's revealed that
   the duppy is Mi-Jeanne (Ti-Jeanne's mom).

   In the CN Tower, Rudy sets the Calabash spirit on Ti-Jeanne who has
   come to confront him after Tony killed Gros-Jeanne. Ti-Jeanne is
   trapped and injected with Buff, a drug that paralyzes her. While in a
   state of paralysis, Ti-Jeanne slips into an "astral" state or spirit
   state, and she calls upon the ancestor spirits to help her. They kill
   Rudy by allowing the "weight of every murder he had done fell on him."

   Meanwhile, Premier Uttley's new heart (Gros-Jeanne's heart) attacks her
   body. Eventually, it takes over her spirit and when she wakes up from
   the surgery, she has a change of mind about human heart donorship and
   declares that she will make an attempt to help Toronto return to a rule
   of law by funding small business owners.

   On Gros-Jeanne's Nine Night event, all her friends arrive to help out,
   and so does Tony. Ti-Jeanne has trouble forgiving him for killing
   Gros-Jeanne, but Jenny tells her "he wants to do penance." She lets him
   into the event to say goodbye to Gros-Jeanne and is surprised that Baby
   doesn't cry around him anymore. It ends with Ti-Jeanne sitting on her
   steps, thinking of what she'll name Baby, who is possessed with the
   spirit of Dunston, Gros-Jeanne's former lover.

   Ti-Jeanne's personal growth throughout the novel is evident in her
   attitude toward her elders, culture, and outlook on life. Through
   acceptance of her ancestry and culture, she finds power and support to
   overcome steep odds and end the horrific violence of the posse and
   their heinous leader, despite her personal connection to the man who
   took her mother away from her at a young age. The story closes with
   hope, Ti-Jeanne's victory is monumental, and the stolen heart possesses
   the power to permanently change the city of Toronto for the better.
