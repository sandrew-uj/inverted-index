   Vida Winter, a famous novelist in England, has evaded journalists'
   questions about her past, refusing to answer their inquiries and
   spinning elaborate tales that they later discover to be false. Her
   entire life is a secret: and, for over fifty years, reporters and
   biographers have tried innumerable methods in an attempt to extract the
   truth from Winter. With her health quickly fading, Winter enlists
   Margaret Lea, a bookish amateur biographer, to hear her story and write
   her biography. With her own family secrets, Lea finds the process of
   unraveling the past for Winter bringing her to confront her own ghosts.

   The novel opens as Lea returns to her apartment above her father's
   antiquarian bookshop and finds a hand-written letter from Winter. It
   requests her presence at the author's residence and offers the chance
   to write Winter's life story before she succumbs to a terminal illness.
   Lea is surprised by the proposal, as she is only vaguely aware of the
   famous author and has not read any of the dozens of novels penned by
   Winter.

   While considering the offer, Lea's curiosity prompts her to read her
   father's rare copy of Winter's Thirteen Tales of Change and
   Desperation. She is unexpectedly spellbound by the stories and confused
   when she realises the book contains only twelve stories. Where is the
   thirteenth tale? Intrigued, Margaret agrees to meet with the ageing
   author--if only to discuss her reasons for not accepting the position
   as Winter's biographer.

   During their meeting at Winter's home, Lea attempts to politely decline
   the offer and leave, but is stopped at the door by the pleas of the
   older woman. With promises of a ghost story involving twins, Winter
   desperately implores the bibliophile to reconsider. By the end of the
   encounter, Lea finds herself increasingly drawn to the story and
   proposes a conditional agreement to Winter; to earn the trust of her
   biographer, Vida Winter must supply her with three verifiable truths.
   Somewhat reluctantly, the three secrets are extracted from their
   keeper. Afterwards, Winter and Lea begin their adventure into the past
   with; "Once upon a time there were two little girls...".

   As Vida Winter tells her story to Lea, she shares dark family secrets
   which have long been kept hidden. She recalls her days at Angelfield
   (the estate that was her childhood home), which has since burned and
   been abandoned. Recording Winter's account (the author allows no
   questions), Lea becomes completely immersed in the strange and
   troubling story. In the end, both women have to confront their pasts
   and the weight of family secrets, as well as the ghosts that haunt them
   both.
