   In the aftermath of a devastating nuclear war, Americans have come to
   blame technology for the disaster, and far from seeking to recover what
   was destroyed, are actively opposed to any such attempt.

   Religious sects which even before the war opposed modern technology and
   avoided its use in their daily life have adjusted to the
   post-apocalypse situation far more easily than anyone else, and feeling
   themselves vindicated have come to dominate the post-war society. They
   gained an enormous number of new members, though those families which
   had been such before the war are honoured and privileged, their special
   status indicated by slightly different clothing.

   All the pre-war American cities have been destroyed in the war, and
   their re-construction is expressly forbidden. The US Constitution has
   been amended, with the Thirtieth Amendment disallowing the presence of
   more than a thousand residents or the existence of more than two
   hundred buildings per square mile anywhere in the United States.

   Len Colter and his cousin Esau are adolescent members of the New
   Mennonite community of Piper's Run. Against their fathers' wishes, the
   boys attend a preaching where a trader named Soames is accused and
   stoned to death for his apparent involvement with a forbidden bastion
   of technology known as Bartorstown. They are saved when a trader, Ed
   Hostetter, intervenes. Hostetter grabs a box from Soames' wagon, from
   which Esau steals a radio.

   Though sickened by the stoning and harshly punished by their fathers,
   Len and Esau are fascinated by the idea of a community that secretly
   still holds and harnesses the forbidden technologies. Len's
   grandmother, a little girl at the time of the destruction, sparks his
   interest in the technological past with her stories of big, brightly
   lit cities and little boxes with moving pictures, even a red dress.

   Esau and Len begin to work the radio, trying to make 'noise' come out
   of it. Esau steals three books from the schoolhouse in the hope that
   they would teach the boys to utilise the radio. The two are punished
   harshly after Hostetter outs them as thieves. The radio is smashed by
   Esau's father in rage, and Hostetter demands his wagon be searched lest
   he be accused of being a member of Bartorstown. Esau is whipped and
   Len's father is visibly disappointed. Subsequently, Esau and Len become
   determined to find their way to the fabled Bartorstown and leave
   Piper's Run in search of it, following broken dialogue heard over the
   radio towards a river.

   The boys make their way to a town called Refuge, living with the Judge
   Taylor and his family and working for a warehouse owner, Mike Dulinsky.
   Esau starts a romantic relationship with the Judge's daughter, Amity
   Taylor. Dulinsky wants to build a fifth warehouse to compete
   economically with the town on the other side of the river, Shadwell.
   However, this would violate the Constitution's Thirtieth Amendment as
   the number of buildings would exceed two hundred. He rallies the Refuge
   residents, who initially pledge their support. However, Judge Taylor
   warns Len and Dulinsky of the consequences and that he would go to the
   state authority. The Judge eventually betrays Dulinsky to the Shadwell
   residents. The Shadwell residents double-cross the Judge and kill
   Dulinsky and set fire to Refuge.

   Len, Esau and Amity are saved by Hostetter, who is revealed to be an
   actual member of Bartorstown. Previously, he had to out Esau as a thief
   to conceal his own identity. Len is let down when Hostetter's ship
   turns out to be a regular coal-powered steamship, though eventually
   understanding it was for concealment. Strangely, Hostetter wishes to
   settle in a place like Piper's Run, but is unable to do so. They make a
   long journey to Bartorstown, a place called Fall Creek Canyon.
   Hostetter remarks that even those who set foot in Bartorstown do not
   know it is the Bartorstown, as the scientific facilities were buried
   from sight and Fall Creek Canyon resembles any ordinary settlement.
   Before the journey is complete, Len begins to think of Hostetter as a
   father-figure, the latter reciprocating that sentiment.

   In Fall Creek, Amity and Esau are wed, while the three are sworn to
   secrecy and are told they will be shot if they attempt to leave. The
   town's leaders seek to use the childlike vision that Len and Esau had
   of Bartorstown to inspire the workers, who have been working for long
   without an end in sight. Len becomes romantically tangled with a Joan
   Wepplo, who possesses a red dress. Joan, in contrast to Len, has
   resented her upbringing in Bartorstown and seeks to leave, though the
   residents of Bartorstown are unable to.

   The scientists of Bartorstown have been working on a long-term project
   with an Artificial Intelligence, Clementine, aimed at creating a
   forcefield that would eradicate the splitting of atoms, preventing
   future misuse of nuclear technology. They feed Clementine equations in
   the hope of creating the ultimate equation to produce the forcefield.
   Len is shocked to find that Bartorstown relies on nuclear power,
   conflicting firmly with his religious beliefs that the devilish nuclear
   power which annihilated society should be abstained from entirely. The
   community's rationalisation that sooner or later, others would unlock
   the lost secrets of nuclear technology and that it would be better to
   be preventive does not sit well with Len and his religious upbringing.
   Len's vision of Bartorstown is broken at last when Clementine is
   revealed to be maliciously sentient, and has withheld the ultimate
   truth as to whether the nuclear forcefield was ever possible, rendering
   the work of Bartorstown through the ages obsolete and void.

   Len and Joan, now married, plot an escape from Bartorstown, and the two
   succeed, blending in with tribals to evade Bartorstown's surveillance.
   Len's journey is painful and he thinks of the long walk back to Piper's
   Run as his religious redemption. However, they are tracked down by
   Hostetter. The three sit together in a small town where a preaching is
   occurring, in similar circumstances where Soames was stoned. Len
   mentally prepares for himself to die, thinking of Soames and Dulinsky
   and the disillusioned Bartorstown scientists and acknowledging that
   change would come around eventually, even if he as an individual passed
   on. Len gives up the opportunity to out Hostetter as a Bartorstown
   member to the crowd to be stoned, and Hostetter reciprocates by not
   outing Len. Later, Hostetter is revealed to have armed backup that
   would have shot Len and Joan if he had outed Hostetter, but Hostetter
   reiterates that he knew Len so long and trusted Len that he never would
   have needed the backup. Hostetter, Len and Joan then make their way
   back to Bartorstown.
