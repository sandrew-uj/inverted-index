   Clarissa Dalloway goes around London in the morning, getting ready to
   host a party that evening. The nice day reminds her of her youth spent
   in the countryside in Bourton and makes her wonder about her choice of
   husband; she married the reliable Richard Dalloway instead of the
   enigmatic and demanding Peter Walsh, and she "had not the option" to be
   with a close female friend, Sally Seton. Peter reintroduces these
   conflicts by paying a visit that morning.

   Septimus Warren Smith, a First World War veteran suffering from
   deferred traumatic stress, spends his day in the park with his
   Italian-born wife Lucrezia, where Peter Walsh observes them. Septimus
   is visited by frequent and indecipherable hallucinations, mostly
   concerning his dear friend Evans who died in the war. Later that day,
   after he is prescribed involuntary commitment to a psychiatric
   hospital, he commits suicide by jumping out of a window.

   Clarissa's party in the evening is a slow success. It is attended by
   most of the characters she has met throughout the book, including
   people from her past. She hears about Septimus' suicide at the party
   and gradually comes to admire this stranger's act, which she considers
   an effort to preserve the purity of his happiness.
