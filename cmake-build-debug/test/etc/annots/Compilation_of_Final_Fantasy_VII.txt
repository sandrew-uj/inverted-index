   The setting of Final Fantasy VII is a world that has been described as
   an industrial or post-industrial science fiction milieu. It is
   referred to as "the Planet" by the series characters, and was
   retroactively named "Gaia" in some Square Enix promotional material and
   by game staff. The planet's lifeforce is called the
   Lifestream, a flow of spiritual energy that gives life to everything on
   the Planet. Its processed form is known as "Mako".
   During VII and its prequels, the Lifestream is being used by the
   megacorporation Shinra as an energy source. This is in turn causing the
   Planet to dangerously weaken, threatening the existence of everything
   and everyone on the planet. The main narrative of VII focuses on
   an eco-terrorist group known as AVALANCHE, chronicling their conflict
   with Shinra president Rufus Shinra and his subordinates, including the
   covert Turks, and SOLDIER, an elite fighting force created by giving
   humans raw Mako. Eventually, all come under threat from Sephiroth,
   a member of SOLDIER created through Shinra experimentation and driven
   mad when he learns the truth about his origins, and Jenova, an alien
   lifeform which seeks to destroy all life on the Planet. Among
   the main characters are Cloud Strife, a mercenary and self-proclaimed
   ex-SOLDIER, Aerith Gainsborough, a flower seller and last member of an
   ancient tribe known as the Cetra, Tifa Lockhart, Cloud's childhood
   friend, and Vincent Valentine, a former Turk who was made immortal by
   Shinra experimentation. During the conflict, Sephiroth summons a
   destructive spell called Meteor to mortally wound the Planet. When
   Aerith attempts to summon Holy, a defense mechanism that can stop
   Meteor, she is killed by Sephiroth. Eventually, the party are
   successful in defeating Sephiroth, and the Lifestream reinforces Holy,
   successfully stopping Meteor.

   The Compilation titles act as continuations and expansions on the core
   narrative, with them focusing on various characters. Advent Children
   begins two years after VII, when people across the world are succumbing
   to a disease called Geostigma and Cloud, suffering from guilt, is
   forced to confront Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo, avatars of Sephiroth's
   will. Before Crisis begins six years prior to the events of
   VII, and follows the confrontations between the Turks and the original
   incarnation of AVALANCHE. Crisis Core takes place in a similar
   time period, but follows events from the point of view of Zack, a
   SOLDIER who befriended Cloud and was killed by Shinra troops after
   turning against the company. Among the characters who interact with
   Zack is Genesis Rhapsodos, a member of SOLDIER who successfully rebels
   and eventually decides to protect the Planet. Dirge of Cerberus is
   set a year after Advent Children, and focuses on Vincent's conflict
   against Deepground, a sect of SOLDIER that was trapped beneath Midgar
   during Meteor's descent. Last Order takes place during the events at
   Nibelheim, where Jenova was originally stored and Sephiroth first found
   out about himself.
