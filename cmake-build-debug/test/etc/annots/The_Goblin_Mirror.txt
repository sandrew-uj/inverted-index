   An ill-wind disturbs the peaceful land of Maggiar and the wizard,
   Karoly requests leave to consult with his sister, Ysabel over the
   mountain. Lord Stani instructs his two eldest sons, Bogdan and Tamas,
   and his master huntsman, Nikolai to accompany Karoly. After a difficult
   trip over the mountain, they approach a tower, Krukczy Straz where they
   hope to find shelter, but are ambushed by goblins. The goblins have
   overrun the tower, killing all inside. Tamas is separated from the
   others but is rescued by Ela, a witchling who takes him to her
   mistress, Ysabel in a neighboring tower, Tajny Straz. But this tower
   has also been raided by goblins and all are killed, including Ysabel.
   Ela goes into the tower and retrieves Ysabel's shard from the goblin
   mirror. Then Azdra'ik, the goblin lord appears, but does not threaten
   them. He tells Tamas he must take the mirror fragment from Ela because
   it is too powerful for her to use. Ela takes Tamas to the next tower at
   the ruins of what was Hasel. Here Ela looks into the mirror but is
   overwhelmed by the goblin queen staring back at her. Tamas is startled
   when the queen looks at him and calls him a wizard, which, he assures
   Ela he is not. Ela is drawn to the goblin queen at the lake and Tamas
   tries to follow her, but gets lost. Azdra'ik finds him and together
   they search for Ela.

   Back in Maggiar, Yuri, Tamas's younger brother has been left behind to
   look after Tamas's dog, Zadny. But Zadny, pining for his master,
   escapes his pen and tracks Tamas's scent over the mountain with Yuri in
   pursuit. Near Krukczy Straz, Yuri finds an injured Nikolai, and
   together they follow Zadny, still on Tamas's trail, to Tajny Straz. But
   by the time they get there, Tamas has already left. Then Karoly arrives
   and reveals to Nikolai the story of the succession of witches, their
   bargains with the goblin queen, and the mirror fragment. Karoly
   realizes that Ela must have the shard and says he must take it from her
   before she misuses it. The three then head for Hasel to find Ela. At
   Hasel, Zadny continues his pursuit of Tamas, and realising that Ela and
   Tamas must be together, they all follow Zadny.

   Azdra'ik and Tamas find Ela near the goblin lake. Much of the
   surrounding landscape has been devastated by marauding goblin armies
   and a darkness spreads from the lake. The goblin queen is expanding her
   sphere of influence. Ela is tempted to try the mirror again, but Tamas,
   slowly becoming aware of the wizard in him, convinces her otherwise.

   Yuri, running ahead in pursuit of Zadny, stumbles into the goblin
   queen's hall. There he finds the goblin mirror and sees Bogdan in it.
   Bogdan, under the queen's spell, pulls Yuri into the mirror. Tamas
   arrives and tries to persuade Bogdan to free Yuri, but Bogdan
   challenges Tamas and in his rage is accidentally killed. Tamas and Ela
   confront the goblin queen. The shard returns to the mirror but with
   their combined magic they seize control of it and banish the goblin
   queen and her armies. Karoly and Nikolai arrive but the darkness is
   already receding. Karoly reveals that Azdra'ik used goblin magic to
   "father" Ytresse with Ylena and that Ela is Azdra'ik's great
   grand-daughter and Karoly's niece. Tamas, now in control of Azdra'ik,
   elects to let the goblin lords remain on earth.
