   After 1982, the world experienced a devastating nuclear war. Fallout
   and radiation has caused widespread mutations to human and animal
   populations alike. There is a new messianic religion, akin to
   gnosticism. The members of this religion, known as the Servants of
   Wrath or SOWs, worship the creator and detonator of the war's ultimate
   weapon, Carleton Lufteufel (from the German words "Luft," meaning
   "air," and "Teufel," meaning "Devil"), ex-chairman of the Energy
   Research and Development Agency of the United States of America -
   ERDA/USA.

   In Charlottesville, Utah, there are ample debates between the Servants
   of Wrath and the diminishing congregations of Christians left in
   existence.

   The Servants of Wrath's faith is based on an "anger-driven" traditional
   perception of godhood, compared to that of the Christian survivors, and
   it is from this that the book derives its name- deus irae, Latin for
   "God of Wrath". Tibor McMasters is an armless, legless cyborg
   phocomelus artist who has been commissioned to paint a mural of
   Lufteufel, though nobody knows where Lufteufel lives, or what he looks
   like.

   The Servants of Wrath leadership ask McMasters to find Lufteufel and
   paint his mural. En route, we learn about the absence of national
   communications systems after the widespread destruction caused by
   nuclear warfare. McMasters and other seekers encounter mutant lizards,
   birds and insects who have evolved sentience, as well as the "Big C", a
   decaying artificial intelligence that also survived the war; it
   survives by consuming humans for their trace elements.

   While trying to remove shrapnel from his forehead, Lufteufel loses
   consciousness from loss of blood, at which point his intellectually
   challenged "daughter", Alice, tries to remove some of the blood using a
   shirt. This leaves a bloody imprint on the fabric. Alice keeps the
   shirt because it is the only remaining likeness of his face, leaving
   her with the only true relic of the God of Wrath, evoking the Christian
   legend of the veil of Veronica and the artifact known as the Shroud of
   Turin.

   Going under the name "Jack Schuld" (German for "guilt"), Lufteufel
   kills a dog belonging to McMasters, and McMasters murders Lufteufel
   without realising his identity. After his death, Alice is visited by
   Lufteufel's "spirit" . He does not speak, but he helps Alice by
   "lifting the fog in her brain", removing her disability. She sees that
   his spirit is finally at peace. Alice is not the only human to
   experience a theophany related to Lufteufel's passing. Another survivor
   has a vision of a "Palm Tree Garden" equivalent to the Garden of Eden.
   This implies that Lufteufel may have been a gnostic demiurge, an evil
   earthbound deity who believes itself omnipotent, but whose abilities
   are constricted compared to "higher levels" of divinity.

   However, McMasters has no knowledge of Lufteufel's death or of the
   alleged visions related to his death. He is tricked by his (Christian)
   companion Pete into using an elderly dying alcoholic vagrant for the
   likeness of Lufteufel for the commissioned church mural, which is
   prominently featured in leading Servants of Wrath institutions. The
   mural's survival is a tacit argument that religious belief is often
   based on mythological accretions, which may not be valid
   interpretations of decisive events in the history of that faith.
