   Three English art students in Paris (Taffy, Laird, and William Bagot
   alias `Little Billee') meet musicians Svengali and Gecko and the
   artist's model and laundress Trilby O'Ferrall.

   Trilby is cheerful, kindhearted, bohemian, and completely tone-deaf:
   "Svengali would test her ear, as he called it, and strike the C in the
   middle and then the F just above, and ask which was higher; and she
   would declare they were both exactly the same." To the bemusement of
   the other characters, Trilby is unable to sing "Ben Bolt" in tune. Yet
   despite being off-key, her singing voice nonetheless has an impressive
   quality.

   The Englishmen and Trilby become friends. Svengali tries to persuade
   Trilby to let him train her voice, but she finds him repulsive and even
   frightening. She and Little Billee fall in love, but his scandalized
   relatives get her to promise to leave him. She leaves Paris with her
   little brother, who later dies of scarlet fever. Trilby then falls
   under Svengali's influence. He hypnotises her and transforms her into a
   diva, La Svengali. Under his spell, Trilby becomes a talented singer,
   performing always in an amnesiac trance.

   Five years later, Little Billee is a famous painter. He, Laird and
   Taffy recognise Trilby as she performs at a concert. Trilby sings
   beautifully but does not appear to be in good health.

   Shortly before another performance, Gecko suddenly turns on Svengali
   and slashes him with a penknife. At the concert, Svengali is stricken
   by a heart attack and is unable to induce the trance. Trilby is unable
   to sing in tune and is subjected to "laughter, hoots, hisses,
   cat-calls, cock-crows." Not having been hypnotised, she is baffled and,
   though she can remember living and travelling with Svengali, cannot
   remember anything of her singing career. Suddenly an audience member
   yells:

          "Oh, ye're Henglish, har yer? Why don't yer sing as yer ought to
          sing -- yer've got voice enough, any'ow! Why don't yer sing in
          tune?" she cries "I didn't want to sing at all -- I only sang
          because I was asked to sing -- that gentleman asked -- that
          French gentleman with the white waistcoat! I won't sing another
          note!"

   As she leaves the stage, Svengali dies. Trilby is stricken with a
   nervous affliction. Despite the efforts of her friends, she dies some
   weeks later--staring at a picture of Svengali. Little Billee is
   devastated and dies shortly afterwards.

   Some years later, Taffy meets Gecko again and learns how Svengali had
   hypnotised Trilby and damaged her health in the process. Gecko reveals
   that he had tried to kill Svengali because he could not bear to see
   Trilby hurt during their awful rehearsals.
