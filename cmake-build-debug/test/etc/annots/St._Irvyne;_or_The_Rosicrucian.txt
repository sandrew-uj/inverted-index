   The novel opens amidst a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer
   in the Swiss Alps who seeks cover from the storm. He is a disillusioned
   outcast from society who seeks to kill himself. A group of monks
   carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him
   and saves his life. Bandits attack them and take Wolfstein to an
   underground hideout. He meets Megalena, whom the bandits have abducted
   after killing her father in an ambush. After Steindolph, one of the
   bandits, recites a ballad about the reanimation of the corpse of a nun
   named Rosa, Wolfstein manages to poison the leader of the bandits,
   Cavigni, in a second attempt. He is able to escape with Megalena.
   Ginotti, a member of the bandits, befriends Wolfstein.

   Wolfstein and Megalena flee to Genoa where they live together. Olympia,
   a woman of the town, seduces Wolfstein. Megalena, enraged by the
   relationship, demands that Wolfstein kill Olympia. Armed with a dagger,
   Wolfstein is unable to kill her. Olympia kills herself.

   Ginotti follows Wolfstein. Ginotti is a member of the Rosicrucian, or
   Rose Cross, Order. He is an alchemist who seeks the secret of
   immortality. He tells Wolfstein that he will give him the secret to
   immortality if he will renounce his faith and join the sect.

   Eloise de St. Irvyne is the sister of Wolfstein who lives in Geneva,
   Switzerland. Ginotti, under his new identity of Frederic Nempere,
   travels to Geneva and seeks to seduce her.

   Ginotti reveals his experiments in his lifelong quest to find the
   secret of eternal life: "From my earliest youth, before it was quenched
   by complete satiation, curiosity, and a desire of unveiling the latent
   mysteries of nature, was the passion by which all the other emotions of
   my mind were intellectually organized. ... Natural philosophy at last
   became the peculiar science to which I directed my eager enquiries." He
   has studied science and the laws of nature to ascertain the mysteries
   of life and of being: "I thought of death---... I cannot die.---'Will
   not this nature---will not the matter of which it is composed---exist
   to all eternity? Ah! I know it will; and, by the exertions of the
   energies with which nature has gifted me, well I know it shall.'"
   Ginotti tells Wolfstein that he will reveal the "secret of immortal
   life" to him if he will take certain prescribed ingredients and "mix
   them according to the directions which this book will communicate to
   you" and meet him in the abbey at St. Irvyne.

   In the final scene, which takes place at the abbey of St. Irvyne in
   France, Wolfstein finds the corpse of Megalena in the vaults. An
   emaciated Ginotti confronts Wolfstein. Wolfstein is asked if he will
   deny his Creator. Wolfstein refuses to renounce his faith. Lightning
   strikes the vaults as thunder and a sulphurous windstorm blast the
   abbey. Both men are struck dead. This is the penalty they pay for "the
   delusion of the passions", for tampering with forces that they neither
   can control nor understand in seeking "endless life".
