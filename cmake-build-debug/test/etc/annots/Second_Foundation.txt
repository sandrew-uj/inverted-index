   Second Foundation is the third novel published of the Foundation Series
   by American writer Isaac Asimov, and the fifth in the in-universe
   chronology. It was first published in 1953 by Gnome Press.

   Second Foundation consists of two previously published novellas
   originally published in Astounding Magazine (with different titles)
   between 1948 and 1950, making this the third volume in Asimov's
   Foundation series. Decades later, Asimov wrote two further sequel
   novels and two prequels. Later writers have added authorized tales to
   the series. The Foundation series is often regarded as one of Isaac
   Asimov's best works, along with his Robot series.

   The term also describes the organization by that name which is the
   focus of the book. The organization's existence (and nothing more) had
   been revealed in Foundation, searched for in Foundation and Empire, and
   makes brief appearances in this novel. It would not be described in
   detail until Foundation's Edge.
