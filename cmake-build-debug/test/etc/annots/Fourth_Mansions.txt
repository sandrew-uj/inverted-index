   Fourth Mansions was inspired by Teresa of Avila's Interior Castle, and
   contains quotations from the book, which Lafferty uses as chapter
   headings. The Interior Castle is a metaphor for an individual's soul;
   its different rooms, different states of the soul. In the middle of the
   Castle the soul is in the purest state, which equals Heaven. Lafferty
   uses more complex symbols in telling a many-sided tale of an
   individual's reaching towards Heaven or Truth. The novel concerns a
   time of great change, when four forces - in the form of secret
   societies - contend to control the next phase of humanity's history. In
   the middle is Fred Foley, an innocent reporter. One of these forces
   intends to unleash a deadly virus on the US, the others attempt to stop
   them. A revolution by Mexican migrants, the craft of "mind weaving" and
   a strange group of "Patricks", all apparently tramps but with great
   resources, appear in the center of a narrative. It has been noted^[by
   whom?] that Illuminatus! repeated several of the themes of this book,
   including the plague and secret society elements.
