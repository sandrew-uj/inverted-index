   Mark, Miles Vorkosigan's clone, masquerades as him and dupes his
   mercenary force, the Dendarii, into undertaking a mission to free about
   50 clones on Jackson's Whole, an anything-goes freebooters' planet
   where Mark was created and raised. These teenage clones are scheduled
   to have their brains replaced by those of their wealthy, aged
   progenitors. When Miles finds out, he attempts to rescue his troops and
   his brother from the mess Mark has made, but is killed by a needle
   grenade. He is frozen in a cryonic chamber on the spot, but the medic
   in charge becomes separated from the rest of the men while retreating
   under fire. The medic uses an automated shipping system to send the
   chamber to safety, but is killed before he can tell anyone what he did
   and where he sent it.

   The Dendarii flee the debacle and take Mark to Miles' parents on
   Barrayar. Cordelia accepts him as another son and has him acknowledged
   legally as a member of the family. After a while, Mark becomes
   frustrated by Barrayaran Imperial Security's lack of progress; he is
   convinced that Miles is still on Jackson's Whole, and decides to go
   there himself. Cordelia helps by buying him a starship. He invites some
   of the Dendarii along, including Captain Quinn, Miles'
   second-in-command and lover.

   Meanwhile, Miles has been secretly received and resuscitated by the
   Duronas, a research group cloned from a medical genius and employed by
   Jackson's Whole magnate Baron Fell. They hope they have Miles (rather
   than Mark) under their care, but he is suffering from normal, hopefully
   temporary, post-revival amnesia, so they are unsure. The Duronas wish
   to hire the Dendarii, who are known for pulling off difficult
   extractions, to help them escape from Jackson's Whole. Miles' memory
   takes some time to return.

   Mark finds Miles, but is captured by Miles' old nemesis, Baron Ryoval,
   and tortured for five days. His personality fragments into four
   sub-personalities: Gorge the glutton, Grunt the sex pervert, Howl the
   masochist, and Killer the assassin. Together, the first three protect
   Mark's fragile persona, while Killer bides his time. When Ryoval's
   assistant informs him that Mark seems to have adjusted remarkably
   quickly and is actually enjoying the torture, a frustrated Ryoval
   decides to study his victim alone. Killer takes the opportunity to kill
   Ryoval, enabling Mark to escape. Mark sells Ryoval's security access
   codes to Baron Fell for a large sum of money and the Durona Group's
   freedom.

   Miles' short death and revivification have serious repercussions for
   his health. Mark has his own problems, thanks to his strange
   upbringing, complicated by the torture. When he asks his mother for
   help, she sends him to Beta Colony for psychiatric treatment and
   therapy.

   By necessity, this novel is told from the viewpoints of Miles and Mark.
   This was the first novel in the Vorkosigan series to be written this
   way, though not the first time Bujold has employed this style; the
   first occasion was in Falling Free.
