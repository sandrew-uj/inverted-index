   An 1817 edition of "Lenore", published by Dieterichsche Buchhandlung

   In the 18th century there were more than eighteen hundred different
   German-speaking political entities in Central Europe. During this
   period, due to influences from the Renaissance and the Enlightenment,
   Latin and French dominated over the German language, and German
   literature had mostly been modelled after French and Italian
   literature. These factors lead few scholars to recognize the existence
   of a distinct German culture or literature.

   In order to gain acknowledgement for the German language and thus
   acquire a distinctively German literary tradition from which it would
   be possible to get a sense of nationality, philosopher Johann Gottfried
   Herder believed that it was necessary to preserve German idioms, for
   they are the element that gives a language its idiosyncrasies and
   distinguishes it from other languages:

     The idioms are the elegances of which no neighbor can deprive us and
     they are sacred to the tutelary goddess of the language. They are
     the elegances woven into the spirit of the language, and this spirit
     is destroyed if they are taken out.  Take the idiomatic out of
     a language and you take its spirit and power.  The idioms of
     the time of the Meistersaenger, of Opitz and Logau, of Luther, etc.
     should be collected  And if they are good for nothing else they
     will at least open the way to the student of the language so he can
     understand the genius of the nationality, and explain one by the
     other. The idioms of every language are the impressions of its
     country, its nationality, its history.

   After reading Reliques of Ancient English Poetry by Thomas Percy and
   James Macpherson's Ossianic poems, Herder thought the means through
   which Germany could create a unique literature of its own would be to
   collect folk songs among the lower classes of Germany:

     It will remain eternally true that if we have no Volk, we shall have
     no public, no nationality, no literature of our own which shall live
     and work in us. Unless our literature is founded on our Volk, we
     shall write eternally for closet sages and disgusting critics out of
     whose mouths and stomachs we shall get back what we have given.

   Buerger answered Herder's plea by publishing "Lenore", which had been
   suggested to him by a Low German Volkslied, similar to the Scottish
   ballad of "Sweet William's Ghost" collected in Percy's
   Reliques. William Taylor has also compared Lenore to "an
   obscure English ballad called 'The Suffolk Miracle'", in which a young
   man appears to his sweetheart, who has no knowledge that he had already
   died, and carries her on horseback for forty miles until the man
   complains he has a headache, which leads the maid to tie her
   handkerchief around his head. After they depart, the young maid returns
   home and is informed by her father that her lover had in fact died,
   whereupon he goes to the young man's grave and digs up the bones,
   finding that his daughter's handkerchief is tied around the skull.
