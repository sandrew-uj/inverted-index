   Noblewoman Alanna of Trebond, disguised as the boy "Alan", exchanges
   places with her twin brother Thom, to go to the royal palace in the
   city of Corus to train for knighthood, while Thom studies magic.^[1]
   Throughout the four novels Alanna struggles with her gender identity,
   as well as going through puberty and bullying. Alanna befriends
   characters of a wide background during the quartet including George,
   the commoner king of the thieves; the scholar Sir Myles of Olau; senior
   students Gareth (Gary) of Naxen, Raoul of Goldenlake, and Prince
   Jonathan of Conte; Princess Thayet of Sarain; Liam Ironarm, a
   martial-arts champion; and Buriram (Buri) Tourakom, Thayet's bodyguard.
   Her principal rivals are classmate Ralon of Malven and Jonathan's
   kinsman Duke Roger. In the second volume, Alanna also acquires the
   magical cat 'Faithful', who accompanies her thereafter (Faithful is
   hinted to be an immortal, but his origins remain unknown.^[2] Because
   of her double identity as a girl masquerading as a boy, small size,
   magic, and impatience, Alanna often questions her own character. In the
   third book, she becomes an honorary member of the 'Bazhir' (a
   Bedouin-like ethnicity) and gains acceptance as a warrior, mage and a
   woman.^[3] In the final volume, Alanna becomes King's Champion to
   Jonathan and Baroness of the coastal estate Pirate's Swoop, following
   her marriage to George Cooper, newly minted Baron of Pirate's
   Swoop.^[4]
