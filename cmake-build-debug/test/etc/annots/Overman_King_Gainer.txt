   The setting and plot of Overman King Gainer are a loose adaptation of
   the novel series La Compagnie des glaces by the French writer
   Georges-Jean Arnaud. After an environmental cataclysm, much of the
   world's population retreated into domed cities called Domepolis, which
   are run by an organization known as "London IMA" (International
   Management Authority) and its police arm, "Saint Regan". However, the
   Domepoli are maintained and supplied by privatized firms such as the
   "Siberian Railroad Company". Many years have passed since the
   cataclysm, and many have begun to believe that the world environment
   has recovered sufficiently enough for humans to begin living outside
   Domepoli. As such, some inhabitants begin planning Exoduses to leave
   these cities and to resettle their ancestral homelands. However, this
   does not sit well with the London IMA or the private firms that
   monopolize trade between the Domepoli, as the loss of people would not
   only lead to a loss in tax and trade revenue, but if the Exodus were to
   be successful, it would show the people that it was no longer necessary
   to rely on the London IMA or the private firms for survival. They
   fiercely oppose any Exoduses, spreading propaganda on the evils effects
   of Exoduses on the Earth's environment, and using military force to
   prevent any attempted Exodus.

   The story begins in a Domepolis in Siberia, where championship video
   game player Gainer Sanga is arrested by Siberian Railroad policewoman
   Adette Kistler on suspicion of being an Exodus member. Ironically he
   isn't, but his friends Sara Kodama and Bello Korissha along with his
   schoolteacher Mamado Azaf are members of the Gauli team, a militia unit
   of the local Exodus group. At the same time, Exodus expert and
   coordinator Gain Bijou lets himself be arrested by the Siberian
   Railroad police as part of his plan to infiltrate the city and steal an
   "Overman", which is a biomechanical giant robot, for use in defending
   the Exodus.

   Gain is placed in the same prison cell as Gainer, and when Gain
   initiates his escape, only Gainer is willing to escape as well. They
   infiltrate the castle of Duke Medaiyu and steal an Overman in the
   Duke's secret museum collection, which Gainer logs into as his video
   game handle: "King Gainer". As Gainer gets the hang of piloting a real
   Overman, he and Gain encounter shut-in Princess Anna, the Duke's
   daughter, who supports the Exodus and wants to see the world and people
   other than her tutor, Lioubov Smettana. Using an annual festival
   presented by idol singer and co-Exodus leader, Meeya Laujin, as cover,
   the Exodus executes their plan: take much of the Domepolis, block by
   block, using heavy hauler machines called Silhouette Mammoths and move
   them over 3000 km across the Siberian tundra to their ancestral
   homeland, "Yapan". As the Exodus moves out, the Siberian Railroad
   police chief, Yassaba Jin, mobilizes his forces to stop them. Other
   obstacles to the Exodus are Kistler's and Jin's subordinates Jaboli
   Mariela, Kejinan Datto, and Enge Gam, Siberian Railroad president Kizz
   Munt, Saint Regan policemen Asuham Boone and Zakki Bronco, and Overman
   aces Cynthia Lane and Kashmir Valle.
