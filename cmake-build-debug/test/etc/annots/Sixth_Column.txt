   A top secret research facility hidden in the Colorado mountains is the
   last remaining outpost of the United States Army after its defeat by
   the PanAsians. The conquerors had absorbed the Soviets after being
   attacked by them and had then gone on to absorb India as well. The
   invaders are ruthless and cruel. As an example, they crush an abortive
   rebellion by killing 150,000 American civilians as punishment. Noting
   that the invaders have allowed the free practice of religion (the
   better to pacify their slaves), the Americans set up their own church
   in order to build a resistance movement... a "sixth column", as opposed
   to a traitorous fifth column.

   The laboratory is in turmoil as the novel begins. All but six of the
   personnel have died suddenly, due to unknown forces released by an
   experiment operating within the newly discovered magneto-gravitic or
   electro-gravitic spectra. The surviving scientists soon learn that they
   can selectively kill people by releasing the internal pressure of their
   cell membranes, among other things. Using this discovery, they
   construct a race-selective weapon that will stun or kill only Asians.
