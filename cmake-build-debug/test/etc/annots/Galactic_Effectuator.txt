   The sleuth Miro Hetzel, who calls himself a "galactic effectuator",
   resolves two mysteries in this combined short novel and short story. In
   The Dogtown Tourist Agency, he investigates a plan to deliver weapons
   to the fairly primitive "Gomaz" race on a distant planet called Maz.
   The story starts with Hetzel tracking a playboy, and then moves onto
   him taking a case for Palladian Micronics, a robot firm. Hetzel meets
   with Palladian's CEO, who cannot understand how a competitor is selling
   a similar robot at a much cheaper price. While the CEO does not know
   how the competitor is beating his price, the clues point to the
   primitive planet of Maz. To find the answer to the mystery, Hetzel must
   penetrate deeper into the primitive zones of the planet, where
   encounters with the aggressive Gomaz race add to his peril.

   In the short story Freitzke's Turn, Hetzel takes on a case for Conwit
   Clent, who has had his testicles stolen by a rogue doctor. To track
   down the doctor, Hetzel has to go to his old university, where he
   studied as a young man. There he encounters a former rival, the
   brilliant Faurence Dacre, who may be the key to resolving the mystery.
