   The book focuses on several key events that happen after Nafai, Elemak,
   Issib, Mebbekew, Zdorab and the father Volemak leave for the desert.
   Elemak has a dream from the Oversoul, foretelling Volemak's sons going
   back to the city of Basilica to get wives. The sons proceed to Nafai's
   and Issib's mother, Rasa, who is attempting to keep order within the
   city. However Hushidh, a raveler under Rasa's care, makes the
   disastrous mistake of severing the ties between Rashgallivak and his
   men, leading to widespread riots across the city.

   At the same time, General Moozh, leader of the "Wetheads" nation
   (Gorayni), is attempting to conquer cities around Basilica. He sees a
   strategic chance, and taking only 1000 soldiers, marches across the
   desert to conquer the city. He arrives in time to help the local city
   guard quell the uprising, and slowly begins taking control of its
   affairs.

   The remainder of the book deals with Nafai and his brothers' (Elemak
   and Mebbekew, who had come) attempts at finding wives. In the end, they
   are all forced into a house arrest along with Rasa, where Elemak takes
   Eiadh as his wife, Mebbekew takes Dol, Nafai takes Luet, the waterseer,
   with Rasa and Hushidh deciding to come as wives for Volemak and Issib,
   respectively. Shedemei (a Basilican geneticist) is dragged along with
   enough plants and animals to populate the future earth with new
   species, also as a wife to Zdorab.

   The ending comes when Moozh decides to marry Hushidh to politically tie
   himself with the city. Hushidh's original mother arrives to stop the
   ceremony, since Hushidh is actually the daughter of Moozh. Nafai's
   party is escorted out of the city with the women and supplies for the
   camp.

   Moozh ends up conquering the "Wetheads" he had been working for, while
   his Basilican second-in-command defends the city against the rival
   nation, Potokgavan. In the end he is killed during an invasion and
   Basilica falls, scattering the citizens to various other nations and
   cities on Harmony. Earlier in the book, the Oversoul had revealed the
   purpose of this dispersal was to force people with a strong connection
   to it to breed with people who had a weak connection, and so delay the
   eventual time when the Oversoul loses control of the people of Harmony.
