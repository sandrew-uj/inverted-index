   The story starts with two men and two women at an observatory in New
   York City. They are awaiting the appearance of a new star that has been
   predicted by top scientists that will rival the moon in intensity. The
   entire world is excited about this new heavenly body and people stay up
   the night waiting. It is February and very cold but around midnight the
   temperature starts to climb and the snow melts. Then a very bright moon
   rises, which is brighter than normal because it is reflecting the new
   star's light. Then the sky turns ablaze with color as the new sun is
   seen and the blast of heat is almost immediate. One of the women
   screams as a nearby flag catches fire. The city starts to go up in
   smoke and those directly in the heat quickly die. One of the men in the
   observatory flees with his wife and it is assumed that they die
   outside. The remaining man and woman quickly try to get to the cellar
   as the building they are in starts to collapse. The extreme heat has
   evaporated the sea water which now comes back as a torrential rain. The
   city starts to flood and a thick cloud of steam fills the air. The
   couple makes it down to the cellar and the heat is almost unbearable as
   they just lie on the floor going in and out of consciousness. Finally
   the rain stops and the heat starts to go up again but then the new sun
   goes down and darkness brings some coolness to them. They talk about
   their future and realize that when the new sun comes up the next
   morning, the heat will kill them and everyone left. They realize that
   they will be dead soon and have a last kiss. The sun then comes up and
   the world is burnt to a crisp.
